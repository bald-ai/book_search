Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early\nhours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harry’s\nroom.\n“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If you can’t\ncontrol that owl, it’ll have to go!”\nHarry tried, yet again, to explain.\n“She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to flying around outside. If I could\njust let her out at night—”\n“Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling\nfrom his bushy mustache. “I know what’ll happen if that owl’s let out.”\nHe exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.\nHarry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud\nbelch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.\n“I want more bacon.”\n“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia, turning\nmisty eyes on her massive son. “We must build you up while we’ve got the\nchance… I don’t like the sound of that school food…”\n“Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,”\nsaid Uncle Vernon heartily. “Dudley gets enough, don’t you, son?”\nDudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the\nkitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.\n“Pass the frying pan.”\n“You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry irritably.\nThe effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was\nincredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the\nwhole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to\nher mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples.\n“I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean—”\n“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, spraying spit over\nthe table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?”\n“But I—”\n“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon,\npounding the table with his fist.\n“I just—”\n“I WARNED YOU!

        "text": "trying to heave Dudley to his feet.\n“All right,” said Harry, “all right…”\nUncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and\nwatching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.\nEver since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle\nVernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment,\nbecause Harry Potter wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not\nnormal as it is possible to be.\nHarry Potter was a wizard—a wizard fresh from his first year at\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were\nunhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry\nfelt.\nHe missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant\nstomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts,\nhis classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving\nby owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in\nthe tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to\nthe Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most\npopular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls,\nand fourteen players on broomsticks).\nAll Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line\nNimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the\nstairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the\nDursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because\nhe hadn’t practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went\nback to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what\nwizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as\nfar as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of\ndeepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig,\ninside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the\nwizarding world.\nHarry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was\nlarge and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was\nhorse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the\nother hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black\nhair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead\nwas a thin, lightning-shaped scar.\nIt was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a\nwizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the\nreason he had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.\nAt the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from\nthe greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most\nwitches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in\nVoldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and\nsomehow—nobody understood why—Voldemort’s powers had been\ndestroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.\nSo Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her"

        "text": "somehow—nobody understood why—Voldemort’s powers had been\ndestroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.\nSo Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her\nhusband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding\nwhy he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the\nDursleys’ story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his\nparents.\nAnd then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the\nwhole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school,\nwhere he and his scar were famous… but now the school year was over, and\nhe was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a\ndog that had rolled in something smelly.\nThe Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today happened to be\nHarry’s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d\nnever given him a real present, let alone a cake—but to ignore it\ncompletely…\nAt that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,\n“Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.”\nHarry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.\n“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,” said\nUncle Vernon.\nHarry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle\nVernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He’d been talking of\nnothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to\ndinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle\nVernon’s company made drills).\n“I think we should run through the schedule one more time,” said\nUncle Vernon. “We should all be in position at eight o’clock. Petunia, you\nwill be—?”\n“In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting to welcome\nthem graciously to our home.”\n“Good, good. And Dudley?”\n“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a foul, simpering\nsmile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”\n“They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.\n“Excellent, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry.\n“And you?”\n“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I’m not\nthere,” said Harry tonelessly.\n“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastily. “I will lead them into the lounge,\nintroduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eight-fifteen—”\n“I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia.\n“And, Dudley, you’ll say—”\n“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?” said\nDudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.\n“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia.\n“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.\n“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,”\nsaid Harry dully.\n“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at\ndinner. Petunia, any ideas?”\n“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason… Do tell me\nwhere you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason…”\n“Perfect… Dudley?”"

Petunia, any ideas?”\n“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason… Do tell me\nwhere you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason…”\n“Perfect… Dudley?”\n“How about—‘We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr.\nMason, and I wrote about you.’”\nThis was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia\nburst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so\nthey wouldn’t see him laughing.\n“And you, boy?”\nHarry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.\n“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,” he\nsaid.\n“Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “The Masons\ndon’t know anything about you and it’s going to stay that way. When\ndinner’s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia,\nand I’ll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I’ll have the deal\nsigned and sealed before the news at ten. We’ll be shopping for a vacation\nhome in Majorca this time tomorrow.”\nHarry couldn’t feel too excited about this. He didn’t think the Dursleys\nwould like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive.\n“Right—I’m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and\nme. And you,” he snarled at Harry. “You stay out of your aunt’s way while\nshe’s cleaning.”\nHarry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He\ncrossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his\nbreath:\n“Happy birthday to me… happy birthday to me…”\nNo cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening\npretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never\nfelt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing\nQuidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione\nGranger. They, however, didn’t seem to be missing him at all. Neither of\nthem had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was\ngoing to ask Harry to come and stay.\nCountless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig’s\ncage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it\nwasn’t worth the risk. Underage wizards weren’t allowed to use magic\noutside of school. Harry hadn’t told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only\ntheir terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them\nfrom locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and\nbroomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed\nmuttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing\nout of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence\nfrom Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical\nworld that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal—and now Ron and\nHermione had forgotten his birthday.\nWhat wouldn’t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any\nwitch or wizard? He’d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco\nMalfoy, just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream…"

He’d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco\nMalfoy, just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream…\nNot that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of\nlast term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord\nVoldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was\nstill terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had\nslipped through Voldemort’s clutches for a second time, but it had been a\nnarrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night,\ndrenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now,\nremembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes—\nHarry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been\nstaring absent-mindedly into the hedge—and the hedge was staring back.\nTwo enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.\nHarry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.\n“I know what day it is,” sang Dudley, waddling toward him.\nThe huge eyes blinked and vanished.\n“What?” said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had\nbeen.\n“I know what day it is,” Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.\n“Well done,” said Harry. “So you’ve finally learned the days of the\nweek.”\n“Today’s your birthday,” sneered Dudley. “How come you haven’t got\nany cards? Haven’t you even got friends at that freak place?”\n“Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,” said\nHarry coolly.\nDudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat\nbottom.\n“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said suspiciously.\n“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,”\nsaid Harry.\nDudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.\n“You c-can’t—Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic—he said he’ll\nchuck you out of the house—and you haven’t got anywhere else to go—you\nhaven’t got any friends to take you—”\n“Jiggery pokery!” said Harry in a fierce voice. “Hocus pocus—\nsquiggly wiggly—”\n“MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed\nback toward the house. “MUUUUM! He’s doing you know what!”\nHarry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the\nhedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn’t really done magic,\nbut he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the\nsoapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he\nwouldn’t eat again until he’d finished.\nWhile Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry\ncleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the\nflowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench.\nThe sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he\nshouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing\nHarry had been thinking himself… maybe he didn’t have any friends at"

Harry knew he\nshouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing\nHarry had been thinking himself… maybe he didn’t have any friends at\nHogwarts…\nWish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as\nhe spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down\nhis face.\nIt was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard\nAunt Petunia calling him.\n“Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!”\nHarry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of\nthe fridge stood tonight’s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and\nsugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.\n“Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped Aunt Petunia,\npointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table.\nShe was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.\nHarry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The\nmoment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. “Upstairs!\nHurry!”\nAs he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of\nUncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just\nreached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon’s\nfurious face appeared at the foot of the stairs.\n“Remember, boy—one sound—”\nHarry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door,\nand turned to collapse on his bed.\nThe trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.\nC\nHAPTER 2\nD W\nOBBY’S ARNING\nHarry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little\ncreature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size\nof tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching\nhim out of the garden hedge that morning.\nAs they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s voice from the hall.\n“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”\nThe creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its\nlong, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what\nlooked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.\n“Er—hello,” said Harry nervously.\n“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was\nsure would carry down the stairs. “So long has Dobby wanted to meet you,\nsir… Such an honor it is…”\n“Th-thank you,” said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his\ndesk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to\nask, “What are you?” but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he\nsaid, “Who are you?”\n“Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,” said the creature.\n“Oh—really?” said Harry. “Er—I don’t want to be rude or anything,\nbut—this isn’t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.”\nAunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the living room.

The elf\nhung his head.\n“Not that I’m not pleased to meet you,” said Harry quickly, “but, er, is\nthere any particular reason you’re here?”\n“Oh, yes, sir,” said Dobby earnestly. “Dobby has come to tell you,\nsir… it is difficult, sir… Dobby wonders where to begin…”\n“Sit down,” said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.\nTo his horror, the elf burst into tears—very noisy tears.\n“S-sit down!” he wailed. “Never… never ever…”\nHarry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.\n“I’m sorry,” he whispered, “I didn’t mean to offend you or anything\n—”\n“Offend Dobby!” choked the elf. “Dobby has never been asked to sit\ndown by a wizard—like an equal—”\nHarry, trying to say “Shh!” and look comforting at the same time,\nushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a\nlarge and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat with\nhis great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration.\n“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said Harry, trying to cheer\nhim up.\nDobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started\nbanging his head furiously on the window, shouting, “Bad Dobby! Bad\nDobby!”\n“Don’t—what are you doing?” Harry hissed, springing up and pulling\nDobby back onto the bed—Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud\nscreech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.\n“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who had gone slightly\ncross-eyed. “Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir…”\n“Your family?”\n“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir… Dobby is a house-elf—bound\nto serve one house and one family forever…”\n“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.\nDobby shuddered.\n“Oh, no, sir, no… Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously\nfor coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door\nfor this. If they ever knew, sir—”\n“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?”\n“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for\nsomething, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds\nme to do extra punishments…”\n“But why don’t you leave? Escape?”\n“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby\nfree… Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir…”\nHarry stared.\n“And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,” he\nsaid. “This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can’t anyone help\nyou? Can’t I?”\nAlmost at once, Harry wished he hadn’t spoken. Dobby dissolved\nagain into wails of gratitude.\n“Please,” Harry whispered frantically, “please be quiet.

I’m not even top of\nmy year at Hogwarts; that’s Hermione, she—”\nBut he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.\n“Harry Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby reverently, his orb-\nlike eyes aglow. “Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-\nMust-Not-Be-Named—”\n“Voldemort?” said Harry.\nDobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, “Ah, speak not\nthe name, sir! Speak not the name!”\n“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people don’t like it. My\nfriend Ron—”\nHe stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.\nDobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.\n“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry Potter met the Dark\nLord for a second time, just weeks ago… that Harry Potter escaped yet\nagain.”\nHarry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears.\n“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby\npillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has\nbraved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry\nPotter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door\nlater… Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.”\nThere was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from\ndownstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.\n“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back—term starts on\nSeptember first. It’s all that’s keeping me going. You don’t know what it’s\nlike here. I don’t belong here. I belong in your world—at Hogwarts.”\n“No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears\nflapped. “Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good,\nto lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger.”\n“Why?” said Harry in surprise.\n“There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things\nhappen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,”\nwhispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. “Dobby has known it for\nmonths, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important,\nsir!”\n“What terrible things?” said Harry at once. “Who’s plotting them?”\nDobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head\nfrantically against the wall.\n“All right!” cried Harry, grabbing the elf’s arm to stop him. “You can’t\ntell me.

Harry, however, was completely lost.\n“He hasn’t got a brother, has he?”\nDobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.\n“Well then, I can’t think who else would have a chance of making\nhorrible things happen at Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, there’s\nDumbledore, for one thing—you know who Dumbledore is, don’t you?”\nDobby bowed his head.\n“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had.\nDobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore’s powers rival those of\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir”—\nDobby’s voice dropped to an urgent whisper—“there are powers\nDumbledore doesn’t… powers no decent wizard…”\nAnd before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized\nHarry’s desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with\nearsplitting yelps.\nA sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart\nthudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, “Dudley\nmust have left his television on again, the little tyke!”\n“Quick! In the closet!” hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the\ndoor, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned.\n“What—the—devil—are—you—doing?” said Uncle Vernon through\ngritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry’s. “You’ve just ruined the\npunch line of my Japanese golfer joke… One more sound and you’ll wish\nyou’d never been born, boy!”\nHe stomped flat-footed from the room.\nShaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet.\n“See what it’s like here?” he said. “See why I’ve got to go back to\nHogwarts? It’s the only place I’ve got—well, I think I’ve got friends.”\n“Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?” said Dobby slyly.\n“I expect they’ve just been—wait a minute,” said Harry, frowning.\n“How do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?”\nDobby shuffled his feet.\n“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best\n—”\n“Have you been stopping my letters?”\n“Dobby has them here, sir,” said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of\nHarry’s reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the\npillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione’s neat writing,\nRon’s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from\nthe Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid."

He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby\njumped out of reach.\n“Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word that he\nwill not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! Say\nyou won’t go back, sir!”\n“No,” said Harry angrily. “Give me my friends’ letters!”\n“Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,” said the elf sadly.\nBefore Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door,\npulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs.\nMouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to\nmake a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall\ncarpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room he heard Uncle\nVernon saying, “…tell Petunia that very funny story about those American\nplumbers, Mr. Mason. She’s been dying to hear…”\nHarry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.\nAunt Petunia’s masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and\nsugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in\nthe corner crouched Dobby.\n“No,” croaked Harry. “Please… they’ll kill me…”\n“Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school—”\n“Dobby… please…”\n“Say it, sir—”\n“I can’t—”\nDobby gave him a tragic look.\n“Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own good.”\nThe pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream\nsplattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack like a\nwhip, Dobby vanished.\nThere were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into\nthe kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in\nAunt Petunia’s pudding.\nAt first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the\nwhole thing over. (“Just our nephew—very disturbed—meeting strangers\nupsets him, so we kept him upstairs…”) He shooed the shocked Masons\nback into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an\ninch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt\nPetunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking,\nstarted scrubbing the kitchen clean.\nUncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal—if it hadn’t\nbeen for the owl.\nAunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when\na huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter\non Mrs. Mason’s head, and swooped out again.

It did not contain birthday greetings.\nDear Mr. Potter,\nWe have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at\nyour place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.\nAs you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform\nspells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to\nexpulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of\nUnderage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).\nWe would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that\nrisks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is a\nserious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of\nWarlocks’ Statute of Secrecy.\nEnjoy your holidays!\nYours sincerely,\nMafalda Hopkirk\nIMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE\nMinistry of Magic\nHarry looked up from the letter and gulped.\n“You didn’t tell us you weren’t allowed to use magic outside school,”\nsaid Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. “Forgot to mention\nit… Slipped your mind, I daresay…”\nHe was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared.\n“Well, I’ve got news for you, boy… I’m locking you up… You’re never\ngoing back to that school… never… and if you try and magic yourself out\n—they’ll expel you!”\nAnd laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs.\nUncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid\na man to fit bars on Harry’s window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the\nbedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three\ntimes a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening.\nOtherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock.\nThree days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and\nHarry couldn’t see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed watching\nthe sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably\nwhat was going to happen to him.\nWhat was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts\nwould expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-\ntime low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren’t going to wake up as\nfruit bats, he had lost his only weapon.

Harry, whose insides were aching with\nhunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but he\ndrank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig’s cage and\ntipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food\ntray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust.\n“It’s no good turning your beak up at it—that’s all we’ve got,” said\nHarry grimly.\nHe put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay\nback down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the\nsoup.\nSupposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen\nif he didn’t turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why he\nhadn’t come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go?\nThe room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind\nspinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy\nsleep.\nHe dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading\nUNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the\nbars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby’s\nface in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby called,\n“Harry Potter is safe there, sir!” and vanished. Then the Dursleys appeared\nand Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him.\n“Stop it,” Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head.\n“Leave me alone… cut it out… I’m trying to sleep…”\nHe opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the\nwindow. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a freckle-\nfaced, red-haired, long-nosed someone.\nRon Weasley was outside Harry’s window.\nC\nHAPTER 3\nT B\nHE URROW\n“Ron!” breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up so\nthey could talk through the bars. “Ron, how did you—What the—?”\nHarry’s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit\nhim. Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car,\nwhich was parked in midair. Grinning at Harry from the front seats were\nFred and George, Ron’s elder twin brothers.\n“All right, Harry?” asked George.\n“What’s been going on?” said Ron. “Why haven’t you been answering\nmy letters? I’ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came\nhome and said you’d got an official warning for using magic in front of\nMuggles—”\n“It wasn’t me—and how did he know?”\n“He works for the Ministry,” said Ron. “You know we’re not supposed\nto do spells outside school—”\n“You should talk,” said Harry, staring at the floating car.\n“Oh, this doesn’t count,” said Ron. “We’re only borrowing this.

The car\nrevved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars\nwere pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air.\nHarry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the\nground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously,\nbut there was no sound from the Dursleys’ bedroom.\nWhen the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as\nclose as possible to Harry’s window.\n“Get in,” Ron said.\n“But all my Hogwarts stuff—my wand—my broomstick—”\n“Where is it?”\n“Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can’t get out of this\nroom—”\n“No problem,” said George from the front passenger seat. “Out of the\nway, Harry.”\nFred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry’s\nroom. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an\nordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.\n“A lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing this sort of\nMuggle trick,” said Fred, “but we feel they’re skills worth learning, even if\nthey are a bit slow.”\nThere was a small click and the door swung open.\n“So—we’ll get your trunk—you grab anything you need from your\nroom and hand it out to Ron,” whispered George.\n“Watch out for the bottom stair—it creaks,” Harry whispered back as\nthe twins disappeared onto the dark landing.\nHarry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them\nout of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and George heave his\ntrunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.\nAt last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk\nthrough Harry’s room to the open window. Fred climbed back into the car\nto pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side.\nInch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.\nUncle Vernon coughed again."

HE’S GETTING\nAWAY!”\nBut the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry’s leg slid out of Uncle\nVernon’s grasp—Harry was in the car—he’d slammed the door shut—\n“Put your foot down, Fred!” yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly\ntoward the moon.\nHarry couldn’t believe it—he was free. He rolled down the window,\nthe night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of\nPrivet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were all hanging,\ndumbstruck, out of Harry’s window.\n“See you next summer!” Harry yelled.\nThe Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat,\ngrinning from ear to ear.\n“Let Hedwig out,” he told Ron. “She can fly behind us. She hasn’t had\na chance to stretch her wings for ages.”\nGeorge handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared\njoyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost.\n“So—what’s the story, Harry?” said Ron impatiently. “What’s been\nhappening?”\nHarry told them all about Dobby, the warning he’d given Harry and the\nfiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence when he had\nfinished.\n“Very fishy,” said Fred finally.\n“Definitely dodgy,” agreed George. “So he wouldn’t even tell you\nwho’s supposed to be plotting all this stuff?”\n“I don’t think he could,” said Harry. “I told you, every time he got\nclose to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the\nwall.”\nHe saw Fred and George look at each other.\n“What, you think he was lying to me?” said Harry.\n“Well,” said Fred, “put it this way—house-elves have got powerful\nmagic of their own, but they can’t usually use it without their master’s\npermission.

Can you think of anyone at school\nwith a grudge against you?”\n“Yes,” said Harry and Ron together, instantly.\n“Draco Malfoy,” Harry explained. “He hates me.”\n“Draco Malfoy?” said George, turning around. “Not Lucius Malfoy’s\nson?”\n“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said Harry. “Why?”\n“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He was a big\nsupporter of You-Know-Who.”\n“And when You-Know-Who disappeared,” said Fred, craning around\nto look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of\nit. Load of dung—Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who’s inner\ncircle.”\nHarry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they\ndidn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind,\nthoughtful, and sensitive boy.\n“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf…” said Harry.\n“Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they’ll\nbe rich,” said Fred.\n“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,”\nsaid George. “But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes\nall over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and\nplaces like that; you wouldn’t catch one in our house…”\nHarry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had\nthe best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just\nsee Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family\nservant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly\nlike the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take\nDobby seriously?\n“I’m glad we came to get you, anyway,” said Ron. “I was getting\nreally worried when you didn’t answer any of my letters. I thought it was\nErrol’s fault at first—”\n“Who’s Errol?”\n“Our owl. He’s ancient. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d collapsed on\na delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes—”\n“Who?”\n“The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,”\nsaid Fred from the front.\n“But Percy wouldn’t lend him to me,” said Ron. “Said he needed him.”\n“Percy’s been acting very oddly this summer,” said George, frowning.\n“And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut\nup in his room… I mean, there’s only so many times you can polish a\nprefect badge… You’re driving too far west, Fred,” he added, pointing at a\ncompass on the dashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel.\n“So, does your dad know you’ve got the car?” said Harry, guessing the\nanswer.\n“Er, no,” said Ron, “he had to work tonight. Hopefully we’ll be able to\nget it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.”"

Hopefully we’ll be able to\nget it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.”\n“What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?”\n“He works in the most boring department,” said Ron. “The Misuse of\nMuggle Artifacts Office.”\n“The what?”\n“It’s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you know,\nin case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like, last year, some\nold witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop. This Muggle\nwoman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve her friends tea in it. It was\na nightmare—Dad was working overtime for weeks.”\n“What happened?”\n“The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place\nand one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his\nnose. Dad was going frantic—it’s only him and an old warlock called\nPerkins in the office—and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of\nstuff to cover it up—”\n“But your dad—this car—”\nFred laughed. “Yeah, Dad’s crazy about everything to do with\nMuggles; our shed’s full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells on it,\nand puts it back together again. If he raided our house he’d have to put\nhimself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.”\n“That’s the main road,” said George, peering down through the\nwindshield. “We’ll be there in ten minutes… Just as well, it’s getting\nlight…”\nA faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east.\nFred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields\nand clumps of trees.\n“We’re a little way outside the village,” said George. “Ottery St.\nCatchpole.”\nLower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sun\nwas now gleaming through the trees.\n“Touchdown!” said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground.\nThey had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry\nlooked out for the first time at Ron’s house.\nIt looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra\nrooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so\ncrooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which, Harry\nreminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were perched on\ntop of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance\nread, THE BURROW. Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots\nand a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens were pecking their\nway around the yard.\n“It’s not much,” said Ron.\n“It’s wonderful,” said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive.\nThey got out of the car.\n“Now, we’ll go upstairs really quietly,” said Fred, “and wait for Mum\nto call us for breakfast. Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going,\n‘Mum, look who turned up in the night!’ and she’ll be all pleased to see\nHarry and no one need ever know we flew the car.”"

The\nother three wheeled around.\nMrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and\nfor a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much she\nlooked like a saber-toothed tiger.\n“Ah,” said Fred.\n“Oh, dear,” said George.\nMrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips,\nstaring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered apron\nwith a wand sticking out of the pocket.\n“So,” she said.\n“’Morning, Mum,” said George, in what he clearly thought was a\njaunty, winning voice.\n“Have you any idea how worried I’ve been?” said Mrs. Weasley in a\ndeadly whisper.\n“Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to—”\nAll three of Mrs. Weasley’s sons were taller than she was, but they\ncowered as her rage broke over them.\n“Beds empty! No note! Car gone—could have crashed—out of my\nmind with worry—did you care?—never, as long as I’ve lived—you wait\nuntil your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or\nCharlie or Percy—”\n“Perfect Percy,” muttered Fred.\n“YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY’S\nBOOK!” yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred’s chest. “You could\nhave died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his\njob—”\nIt seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse\nbefore she turned on Harry, who backed away.\n“I’m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,” she said. “Come in and\nhave some breakfast.”\nShe turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous\nglance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.\nThe kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a scrubbed\nwooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of\nhis seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard house before.\nThe clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers\nat all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to\nfeed the chickens, and You’re late. Books were stacked three deep on the\nmantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment\nin Baking, and One Minute Feasts—It’s Magic! And unless Harry’s ears\nwere deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that\ncoming up was “Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress,\nCelestina Warbeck.”\nMrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little\nhaphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the\nfrying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like “don’t know what\nyou were thinking of,” and “never would have believed it.”"

Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which\ntook a surprisingly short time.\n“Blimey, I’m tired,” yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at\nlast. “I think I’ll go to bed and—”\n“You will not,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “It’s your own fault you’ve\nbeen up all night. You’re going to de-gnome the garden for me; they’re\ngetting completely out of hand again—”\n“Oh, Mum—”\n“And you two,” she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. “You can go up to\nbed, dear,” she added to Harry. “You didn’t ask them to fly that wretched\ncar—”\nBut Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, “I’ll help Ron. I’ve\nnever seen a de-gnoming—”\n“That’s very sweet of you, dear, but it’s dull work,” said Mrs. Weasley.\n“Now, let’s see what Lockhart’s got to say on the subject—”\nAnd she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece.\nGeorge groaned.\n“Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden—”\nHarry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley’s book. Written across it in\nfancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household\nPests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good-looking\nwizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always in the\nwizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry\nsupposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all.\nMrs. Weasley beamed down at him.\n“Oh, he is marvelous,” she said. “He knows his household pests, all\nright, it’s a wonderful book…”"

The garden was large, and in Harry’s eyes, exactly what a\ngarden should be. The Dursleys wouldn’t have liked it—there were plenty\nof weeds, and the grass needed cutting—but there were gnarled trees all\naround the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower\nbed, and a big green pond full of frogs.\n“Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,” Harry told Ron as\nthey crossed the lawn.\n“Yeah, I’ve seen those things they think are gnomes,” said Ron, bent\ndouble with his head in a peony bush, “like fat little Santa Clauses with\nfishing rods…”\nThere was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and\nRon straightened up. “This is a gnome,” he said grimly.\n“Gerroff me! Gerroff me!” squealed the gnome.\nIt was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery\nlooking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held it at\narm’s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it\naround the ankles and turned it upside down.\n“This is what you have to do,” he said. He raised the gnome above his\nhead (“Gerroff me!”) and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso.\nSeeing the shocked look on Harry’s face, Ron added, “It doesn’t hurt them\n—you’ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can’t find their way\nback to the gnomeholes.”\nHe let go of the gnome’s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and\nlanded with a thud in the field over the hedge.\n“Pitiful,” said Fred. “I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.”\nHarry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided\njust to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing\nweakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry’s finger and he had a hard\njob shaking it off—until—\n“Wow, Harry—that must’ve been fifty feet…”\nThe air was soon thick with flying gnomes.\n“See, they’re not too bright,” said George, seizing five or six gnomes\nat once. “The moment they know the de-gnoming’s going on they storm up\nto have a look. You’d think they’d have learned by now just to stay put.”\nSoon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a\nstraggling line, their little shoulders hunched.\n“They’ll be back,” said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear"

He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was\nas red as any of his children’s. He was wearing long green robes, which\nwere dusty and travel-worn.\n“What a night,” he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat\ndown around him. “Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to\nput a hex on me when I had my back turned…”\nMr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.\n“Find anything, Dad?” said Fred eagerly.\n“All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,” yawned\nMr. Weasley. “There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn’t my\ndepartment, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some\nextremely odd ferrets, but that’s the Committee on Experimental Charms,\nthank goodness…”\n“Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?” said George.\n“Just Muggle-baiting,” sighed Mr. Weasley. “Sell them a key that\nkeeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it… Of\ncourse, it’s very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit\ntheir key keeps shrinking—they’ll insist they just keep losing it. Bless them,\nthey’ll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it’s staring them in the\nface… But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn’t\nbelieve—”\n“LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?”\nMrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr.\nWeasley’s eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.\n“C-cars, Molly, dear?”\n“Yes, Arthur, cars,” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. “Imagine a\nwizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it\nwas take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to\nmake it fly.”\nMr. Weasley blinked.\n“Well, dear, I think you’ll find that he would be quite within the law to\ndo that, even if—er—he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife\nthe truth… There’s a loophole in the law, you’ll find… As long as he wasn’t\nintending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn’t—”\n“Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote\nthat law!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “Just so you could carry on tinkering with\nall that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your information, Harry\narrived this morning in the car you weren’t intending to fly!”\n“Harry?” said Mr. Weasley blankly. “Harry who?”\nHe looked around, saw Harry, and jumped."

Very pleased to meet you, Ron’s told us\nso much about—”\n“Your sons flew that car to Harry’s house and back last night!” shouted\nMrs. Weasley. “What have you got to say about that, eh?”\n“Did you really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Did it go all right? I—I\nmean,” he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley’s eyes, “that—that\nwas very wrong, boys—very wrong indeed…”\n“Let’s leave them to it,” Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley\nswelled like a bullfrog. “Come on, I’ll show you my bedroom.”\nThey slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an\nuneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up through the house.\nOn the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of a pair of\nbright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap.\n“Ginny,” said Ron. “You don’t know how weird it is for her to be this\nshy. She never shuts up normally—”\nThey climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling\npaint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD’S ROOM.\nHarry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and\nblinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron’s\nroom seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even\nthe ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of\nthe shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards,\nall wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving\nenergetically.\n“Your Quidditch team?” said Harry.\n“The Chudley Cannons,” said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread,\nwhich was emblazoned with two giant black C’s and a speeding cannonball.\n“Ninth in the league.”\nRon’s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a\npile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs,\nthe Mad Muggle. Ron’s magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of\nfrog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was\nsnoozing in a patch of sun.\nHarry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor\nand looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see a\ngang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys’ hedge.\nThen he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost nervously, as\nthough waiting for his opinion.\n“It’s a bit small,” said Ron quickly. “Not like that room you had with\nthe Muggles. And I’m right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he’s always\nbanging on the pipes and groaning…”\nBut Harry, grinning widely, said, “This is the best house I’ve ever been\nin.”\nRon’s ears went pink.\nC\nHAPTER 4\nA F B\nT LOURISH AND LOTTS"

The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys’ house\nburst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he\nlooked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, “Tuck\nyour shirt in, scruffy!” The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes\nwhenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from\nFred and George’s bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry\nfound most unusual about life at Ron’s, however, wasn’t the talking mirror\nor the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like\nhim.\nMrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him\nto eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to\nhim at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about\nlife with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the\npostal service worked.\n“Fascinating!” he would say as Harry talked him through using a\ntelephone. “Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of\ngetting along without magic.”\nHarry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he\nhad arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr.\nand Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The\nmoment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to\nthe floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things\nover whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve\nthe bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending\nhe hadn’t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley\noffered him.\n“Letters from school,” said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron\nidentical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.\n“Dumbledore already knows you’re here, Harry—doesn’t miss a trick, that\nman. You two’ve got them, too,” he added, as Fred and George ambled in,\nstill in their pajamas.\nFor a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters.\nHarry’s told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King’s Cross\nstation on September first. There was also a list of the new books he’d need\nfor the coming year.\nSECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2\nby Miranda Goshawk\nBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart\nGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart\nHolidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart\nTravels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart\nVoyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart\nWanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart\nYear with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart\nFred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry’s.\n“You’ve been told to get all Lockhart’s books, too!” he said. “The new"

Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because\njust then Ron’s elder brother Percy walked in. He was already dressed, his\nHogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest.\n“Morning, all,” said Percy briskly. “Lovely day.”\nHe sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost\nimmediately, pulling from underneath him a molting, gray feather duster—\nat least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it was\nbreathing.\n“Errol!” said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a\nletter from under its wing. “Finally—he’s got Hermione’s answer. I wrote to\nher saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.”\nHe carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand\nhim on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron laid him on the\ndraining board instead, muttering, “Pathetic.” Then he ripped open\nHermione’s letter and read it out loud:\n“‘Dear Ron, and Harry if you’re there,\n“‘I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you\ndidn’t do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry\ninto trouble, too. I’ve been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you\nplease let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a\ndifferent owl, because I think another delivery might finish your one off.\n“‘I’m very busy with schoolwork, of course’—How can she be?” said\nRon in horror. “We’re on vacation!—‘and we’re going to London next\nWednesday to buy my new books. Why don’t we meet in Diagon Alley?\n“‘Let me know what’s happening as soon as you can. Love from\nHermione.’”\n“Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,”\nsaid Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. “What’re you all up to today?”\nHarry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a\nsmall paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that blocked\nit from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice\nQuidditch there, as long as they didn’t fly too high. They couldn’t use real\nQuidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped"

They couldn’t use real\nQuidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped\nand flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another\nto catch. They took turns riding Harry’s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was\neasily the best broom; Ron’s old Shooting Star was often outstripped by\npassing butterflies.\nFive minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over\ntheir shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had\nsaid he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; he stayed\nshut in his room the rest of the time.\n“Wish I knew what he was up to,” said Fred, frowning. “He’s not\nhimself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O.W.L.s and\nhe hardly gloated at all.”\n“Ordinary Wizarding Levels,” George explained, seeing Harry’s\npuzzled look. “Bill got twelve, too. If we’re not careful, we’ll have another\nHead Boy in the family. I don’t think I could stand the shame.”\nBill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie,\nhad already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but knew\nthat Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working\nfor the wizard’s bank, Gringotts.\n“Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this\nyear,” said George after a while. “Five sets of Lockhart books! And Ginny\nneeds robes and a wand and everything…”\nHarry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground\nvault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had left\nhim. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had money; you\ncouldn’t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in Muggle shops. He had never\nmentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys; he didn’t think their\nhorror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of\ngold.\nMrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a\nquick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and\nMrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered\ninside.\n“We’re running low, Arthur,” she sighed. “We’ll have to buy some\nmore today… Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!”\nAnd she offered him the flowerpot.\nHarry stared at them all watching him.\n“W-what am I supposed to do?” he stammered.\n“He’s never traveled by Floo powder,” said Ron suddenly. “Sorry,\nHarry, I forgot.”\n“Never?” said Mr. Weasley. “But how did you get to Diagon Alley to\nbuy your school things last year?”\n“I went on the Underground—”\n“Really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Were there escapators? How\nexactly—”\n“Not now, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Floo powder’s a lot quicker,\ndear, but goodness me, if you’ve never used it before—”\n“He’ll be all right, Mum,” said Fred. “Harry, watch us first.”"

He took a deep breath, scattered the\npowder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm\nbreeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash.\n“D-Dia-gon Alley,” he coughed.\nIt felt as though he were being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed\nto be spinning very fast—the roaring in his ears was deafening—he tried to\nkeep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick—\nsomething hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning\nand spinning—now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face—\nsquinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and\nsnatched glimpses of the rooms beyond—his bacon sandwiches were\nchurning inside him—he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and\nthen—\nHe fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses\nsnap.\nDizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding\nhis broken glasses up to his eyes. He was quite alone, but where he was, he\nhad no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace\nof what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard’s shop—but nothing in here\nwas ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.\nA glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained\npack of cards, and a staring glass eye.

Evil-looking masks stared down from\nthe walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty,\nspiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow\nstreet Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not\nDiagon Alley.\nThe sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it\nhad hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door,\nbut before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other\nside of the glass—and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to\nmeet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco\nMalfoy.\nHarry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his\nleft; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to\npeer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the\nshop.\nThe man who followed could only be Draco’s father. He had the same\npale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the\nshop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter\nbefore turning to his son and saying, “Touch nothing, Draco.”\nMalfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I thought you were\ngoing to buy me a present.”\n“I said I would buy you a racing broom,” said his father, drumming his\nfingers on the counter.\n“What’s the good of that if I’m not on the House team?” said Malfoy,\nlooking sulky and bad-tempered. “Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two\nThousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play\nfor Gryffindor. He’s not even that good, it’s just because he’s famous…\nfamous for having a stupid scar on his forehead…”\nMalfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.\n“…everyone thinks he’s so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and\nhis broomstick—”\n“You have told me this at least a dozen times already,” said Mr.\nMalfoy, with a quelling look at his son. “And I would remind you that it is\nnot—prudent—to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of\nour kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear—ah,\nMr. Borgin.”\nA stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his\ngreasy hair back from his face.\n“Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” said Mr. Borgin in a\nvoice as oily as his hair. “Delighted—and young Master Malfoy, too—\ncharmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and\nvery reasonably priced—”\n“I’m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,” said Mr. Malfoy.\n“Selling?” The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin’s face.\n“You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more\nraids,” said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket\nand unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. “I have a few—ah—items at home"

The name Malfoy still commands a\ncertain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome.

Your son has fine taste,\nsir.”\n“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer,\nBorgin,” said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, “No offense,\nsir, no offense meant—”\n“Though if his grades don’t pick up,” said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly\nstill, “that may indeed be all he is fit for—”\n“It’s not my fault,” retorted Draco. “The teachers all have favorites,\nthat Hermione Granger—”\n“I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard\nfamily beat you in every exam,” snapped Mr. Malfoy.\n“Ha!” said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both\nabashed and angry.\n“It’s the same all over,” said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. “Wizard\nblood is counting for less everywhere—”\n“Not with me,” said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.\n“No, sir, nor with me, sir,” said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.\n“In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,” said Mr. Malfoy\nshortly. “I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business\nelsewhere today—”\nThey started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer\nand nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco paused\nto examine a long coil of hangman’s rope and to read, smirking, the card\npropped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch.\nCursed—Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.\nDraco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He\nwalked forward—he stretched out his hand for the handle—\n“Done,” said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. “Come, Draco—”\nHarry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.\n“Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I’ll expect you at the manor tomorrow"

I’ll expect you at the manor tomorrow\nto pick up the goods.”\nThe moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.\n“Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you\nhaven’t sold me half of what’s hidden in your manor…”\nMuttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry\nwaited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped\nout of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door.\nClutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had\nemerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops\ndevoted to the Dark Arts. The one he’d just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked\nlike the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads\nand, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders.\nTwo shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a\ndoorway, muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to\nhold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he’d be able to find a\nway out of here.\nAn old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous\ncandles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn’t help, as Harry had\nnever heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn’t spoken clearly enough\nthrough his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys’ fire. Trying to stay\ncalm, he wondered what to do.\n“Not lost are you, my dear?” said a voice in his ear, making him jump.\nAn aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked\nhorribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy\nteeth. Harry backed away.\n“I’m fine, thanks,” he said. “I’m just—”\n“HARRY! What d’yeh think yer doin’ down there?”\nHarry’s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded\ndown over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the\nHogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes\nflashing over his great bristling beard.\n“Hagrid!” Harry croaked in relief. “I was lost—Floo powder—”\nHagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away\nfrom the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks\nfollowed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright\nsunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance\n—Gringotts Bank. Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon Alley.\n“Yer a mess!” said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so\nforcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an\napothecary. “Skulkin’ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno—dodgy place,\nHarry—don’ want no one ter see yeh down there—”\n“I realized that,” said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off"

Yer not on yer own?”\n“I’m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,” Harry\nexplained. “I’ve got to go and find them…”\nThey set off together down the street.\n“How come yeh never wrote back ter me?” said Hagrid as Harry\njogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of Hagrid’s\nenormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys.\n“Lousy Muggles,” growled Hagrid. “If I’d’ve known—”\n“Harry! Harry! Over here!”\nHarry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the\nwhite flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her bushy\nbrown hair flying behind her.\n“What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid—Oh, it’s wonderful to\nsee you two again—Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?”\n“As soon as I’ve found the Weasleys,” said Harry.\n“Yeh won’t have long ter wait,” Hagrid said with a grin.\nHarry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street\nwere Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley.\n“Harry,” Mr. Weasley panted. “We hoped you’d only gone one grate\ntoo far…” He mopped his glistening bald patch. “Molly’s frantic—she’s\ncoming now—”\n“Where did you come out?” Ron asked.\n“Knockturn Alley,” said Hagrid grimly.\n“Excellent!” said Fred and George together.\n“We’ve never been allowed in,” said Ron enviously.\n“I should ruddy well think not,” growled Hagrid.\nMrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swinging\nwildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other.\n“Oh, Harry—oh, my dear—you could have been anywhere—”\nGasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and\nbegan sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn’t managed to beat away. Mr.\nWeasley took Harry’s glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and returned\nthem, good as new.\n“Well, gotta be off,” said Hagrid, who was having his hand wrung by\nMrs. Weasley (“Knockturn Alley! If you hadn’t found him, Hagrid!”). “See\nyer at Hogwarts!” And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than\nanyone else in the packed street.\n“Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?” Harry asked Ron and\nHermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps. “Malfoy and his father.”\n“Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?” said Mr. Weasley sharply behind\nthem.\n“No, he was selling—”\n“So he’s worried,” said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. “Oh, I’d\nlove to get Lucius Malfoy for something…”\n“You be careful, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were"

Don’t\ngo biting off more than you can chew—”\n“So you don’t think I’m a match for Lucius Malfoy?” said Mr.\nWeasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of\nHermione’s parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all\nalong the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them.\n“But you’re Muggles!” said Mr. Weasley delightedly. “We must have a\ndrink! What’s that you’ve got there? Oh, you’re changing Muggle money.\nMolly, look!” He pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr. Granger’s\nhand.\n“Meet you back here,” Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and\nHarry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.\nThe vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that\nsped along minature train tracks through the bank’s underground tunnels.\nHarry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys’ vault, but felt\ndreadful, far worse than he had in Knock-turn Alley, when it was opened.\nThere was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold\nGalleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole\nlot into her bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried\nto block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into\na leather bag.\nBack outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered\nvaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted their friend\nfrom Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to a\nsecondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers\noff to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.\n“We’ll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your\nschoolbooks,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. “And not one step\ndown Knockturn Alley!” she shouted at the twins’ retreating backs.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled\nstreet. The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry’s\npocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberry-and-\npeanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up\nthe alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at\na full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch\nSupplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next\ndoor. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George,\nand Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster’s Fabulous Wet-\nStart, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands,\nlopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found\nPercy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects\nWho Gained Power."

They were by no\nmeans the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they approached\nit, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors, trying\nto get in. The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched\nacross the upper windows:\nGILDEROY LOCKHART\nwill be signing copies of his autobiography\nMAGICAL ME\ntoday 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n“We can actually meet him!” Hermione squealed. “I mean, he’s written\nalmost the whole booklist!”\nThe crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs.\nWeasley’s age. A harassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying,\n“Calmly, please, ladies… Don’t push, there… mind the books, now…”\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound right to\nthe back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They\neach grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and sneaked\nup the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and\nMrs. Granger.\n“Oh, there you are, good,” said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathless\nand kept patting her hair. “We’ll be able to see him in a minute…”\nGilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded\nby large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white\nteeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not\nblue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard’s hat was set at a\njaunty angle on his wavy hair.\nA short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs\nwith a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every\nblinding flash.\n“Out of the way, there,” he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better\nshot. “This is for the Daily Prophet—”\n“Big deal,” said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had\nstepped on it.\nGilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron—and then\nhe saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, “It\ncan’t be Harry Potter?”\nThe crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward,\nseized Harry’s arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into\napplause. Harry’s face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the\nphotographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the\nWeasleys.\n“Nice big smile, Harry,” said Lockhart, through his own gleaming"

He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an\narm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said loudly, waving for quiet. “What an\nextraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little\nannouncement I’ve been sitting on for some time!\n“When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he\nonly wanted to buy my autobiography—which I shall be happy to present\nhim now, free of charge—” The crowd applauded again. “He had no idea,”\nLockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to\nthe end of his nose, “that he would shortly be getting much, much more\nthan my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting\nthe real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and\npride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft\nand Wizardry!”\nThe crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being\npresented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly\nunder their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the\nedge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron.\n“You have these,” Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the\ncauldron. “I’ll buy my own—”\n“Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?” said a voice Harry had no\ntrouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face with\nDraco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer.\n“Famous Harry Potter,” said Malfoy. “Can’t even go into a bookshop\nwithout making the front page.”\n“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny. It was the first\ntime she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.\n“Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend!” drawled Malfoy. Ginny went\nscarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of\nLockhart’s books.\n“Oh, it’s you,” said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something\nunpleasant on the sole of his shoe. “Bet you’re surprised to see Harry here,\neh?”\n“Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,” retorted\nMalfoy. “I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all\nthose.”\nRon went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron,\ntoo, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back\nof his jacket.\n“Ron!” said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George.\n“What are you doing? It’s too crowded in here, let’s go outside.”\n“Well, well, well—Arthur Weasley.”\nIt was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco’s shoulder,"

He stood with his hand on Draco’s shoulder,\nsneering in just the same way.\n“Lucius,” said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.\n“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said Mr. Malfoy. “All those raids…\nI hope they’re paying you overtime?”\nHe reached into Ginny’s cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy\nLockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner’s Guide to\nTransfiguration.\n“Obviously not,” Mr. Malfoy said. “Dear me, what’s the use of being a\ndisgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?”\nMr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.\n“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard,\nMalfoy,” he said.\n“Clearly,” said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs.\nGranger, who were watching apprehensively. “The company you keep,\nWeasley… and I thought your family could sink no lower—”\nThere was a thud of metal as Ginny’s cauldron went flying; Mr.\nWeasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a\nbookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their\nheads; there was a yell of, “Get him, Dad!” from Fred or George; Mrs.\nWeasley was shrieking, “No, Arthur, no!”; the crowd stampeded backward,\nknocking more shelves over; “Gentlemen, please—please!” cried the\nassistant, and then, louder than all—\n“Break it up, there, gents, break it up—”\nHagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an\ninstant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a\ncut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of\nToadstools. He was still holding Ginny’s old Transfiguration book. He\nthrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice.\n“Here, girl—take your book—it’s the best your father can give you—”\nPulling himself out of Hagrid’s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from\nthe shop.\n“Yeh should’ve ignored him, Arthur,” said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr.\nWeasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. “Rotten ter the core, the\nwhole family, everyone knows that—no Malfoy’s worth listenin’ ter—bad\nblood, that’s what it is—come on now—let’s get outta here.”\nThe assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them from leaving,\nbut he barely came up to Hagrid’s waist and seemed to think better of it.\nThey hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs.\nWeasley beside herself with fury.\n“A fine example to set for your children… brawling in public… what\nGilderoy Lockhart must’ve thought—”\n“He was pleased,” said Fred. “Didn’t you hear him as we were\nleaving?

They said good-bye to\nthe Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other\nside; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped\nquickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley’s face.\nHarry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before\nhelping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn’t his favorite way to\ntravel.\nC\nHAPTER 5\nT W W\nHE HOMPING ILLOW\nThe end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry’s liking.\nHe was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at the\nBurrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel jealous\nof Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could\nexpect next time he turned up on Privet Drive.\nOn their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner\nthat included all of Harry’s favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering\ntreacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of\nFilibuster fireworks; they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that\nbounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a\nlast mug of hot chocolate and bed.\nIt took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at dawn,\nbut somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do. Mrs. Weasley\ndashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people kept\ncolliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast in their hands; and Mr.\nWeasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed\nthe yard carrying Ginny’s trunk to the car.\nHarry couldn’t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a\nrat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of\ncourse, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added.\n“Not a word to Molly,” he whispered to Harry as he opened the trunk\nand showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage\nfitted easily.\nWhen at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the\nback seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting\ncomfortably side by side, and said, “Muggles do know more than we give\nthem credit for, don’t they?” She and Ginny got into the front seat, which\nhad been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. “I mean, you’d never\nknow it was this roomy from the outside, would you?”\nMr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard,\nHarry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to\nwonder when he’d see it again when they were back—George had forgotten"

Five minutes after that, they skidded to a\nhalt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick. They had\nalmost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that she’d left her diary.\nBy the time she had clambered back into the car, they were running very\nlate, and tempers were running high.\nMr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife.\n“Molly, dear—”\n“No, Arthur—”\n“No one would see—this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I\ninstalled—that’d get us up in the air—then we fly above the clouds. We’d\nbe there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser—”\n“I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight—”\nThey reached King’s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley dashed\nacross the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the\nstation.\nHarry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky\npart was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn’t visible\nto the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier\ndividing platforms nine and ten. It didn’t hurt, but it had to be done\ncarefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.\n“Percy first,” said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock\noverhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually\nthrough the barrier.\nPercy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next;\nFred and George followed.\n“I’ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,” Mrs. Weasley told\nHarry and Ron, grabbing Ginny’s hand and setting off. In the blink of an\neye they were gone.\n“Let’s go together, we’ve only got a minute,” Ron said to Harry.\nHarry made sure that Hedwig’s cage was safely wedged on top of his\ntrunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt perfectly\nconfident; this wasn’t nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder. Both\nof them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully\ntoward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet away from it, they broke into\na run and—\nCRASH.\nBoth trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron’s trunk fell\noff with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig’s cage\nbounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly;\npeople all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, “What in blazes\nd’you think you’re doing?”\n“Lost control of the trolley,” Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got\nup. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there\nwas a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd.\n“Why can’t we get through?” Harry hissed to Ron.\n“I dunno—”\nRon looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still watching\nthem.\n“We’re going to miss the train,” Ron whispered. “I don’t understand"

Ten seconds… nine seconds…\nHe wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the\nbarrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid.\nThree seconds… two seconds… one second…\n“It’s gone,” said Ron, sounding stunned. “The train’s left. What if\nMum and Dad can’t get back through to us? Have you got any Muggle\nmoney?”\nHarry gave a hollow laugh. “The Dursleys haven’t given me pocket\nmoney for about six years.”\nRon pressed his ear to the cold barrier.\n“Can’t hear a thing,” he said tensely. “What’re we going to do? I don’t\nknow how long it’ll take Mum and Dad to get back to us.”\nThey looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because\nof Hedwig’s continuing screeches.\n“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said Harry. “We’re\nattracting too much atten—”\n“Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming. “The car!”\n“What about it?”\n“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”\n“But I thought—”\n“We’re stuck, right?

And\neven underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it’s a real emergency,\nsection nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy—”\n“But your mum and dad…” said Harry, pushing against the barrier\nagain in the vain hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”\n“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know how to\nApparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother\nwith Floo powder and the car because we’re all underage and we’re not\nallowed to Apparate yet…”\nHarry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.\n“Can you fly it?”\n“No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to face the exit.\n“C’mon, let’s go. If we hurry we’ll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express\n—”\nAnd they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of\nthe station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was\nparked.\nRon unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand.\nThey heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got\ninto the front.\n“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the ignition with\nanother tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic\nwas rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty.\n“Okay,” he said.\nRon pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around\nthem vanished—and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath\nhim, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his\nnose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a\nfew feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars."

The car vanished. Then it flickered back\nagain.\n“Hold on!” Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the accelerator;\nthey shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything turned dull and\nfoggy.\n“Now what?” said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing\nin on them from all sides.\n“We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,” said Ron.\n“Dip back down again—quickly—”\nThey dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their\nseats, squinting at the ground.\n“I can see it!” Harry yelled. “Right ahead—there!”\nThe Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet\nsnake.\n“Due north,” said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard.\n“Okay, we’ll just have to check on it every half hour or so—hold on—”\nAnd they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst out into\na blaze of sunlight.\nIt was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of\nfluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.\n“All we’ve got to worry about now are airplanes,” said Ron.\nThey looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they\ncouldn’t stop.\nIt was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This,\nthought Harry, was surely the only way to travel—past swirls and turrets of\nsnowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat pack of toffees\nin the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing Fred’s and George’s\njealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping\nlawn in front of Hogwarts castle.\nThey made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther\nnorth, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view. London\nwas soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in\nturn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored\nants, villages with tiny toy churches.\nSeveral uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some\nof the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them extremely thirsty\nand they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but\nHarry’s T-shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept\nsliding down to the end of his sweaty nose.

Why hadn’t they been able to get onto platform nine and\nthree-quarters?\n“Can’t be much further, can it?” croaked Ron, hours later still, as the\nsun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink. “Ready\nfor another check on the train?”\nIt was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped\nmountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds.\nRon put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again, but\nas he did so, the engine began to whine.\nHarry and Ron exchanged nervous glances.\n“It’s probably just tired,” said Ron. “It’s never been this far before…”\nAnd they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and\nlouder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were blossoming in the\nblackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the\nwindshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest.\n“Not far,” said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, “not far now,” and\nhe patted the dashboard nervously.\nWhen they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they had to\nsquint through the darkness for a landmark they knew.\n“There!” Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump. “Straight\nahead!”\nSilhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood\nthe many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle.\nBut the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed.\n“Come on,” Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a little\nshake, “nearly there, come on—”\nThe engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the\nhood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they\nflew toward the lake.\nThe car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry saw\nthe smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below. Ron’s knuckles\nwere white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled again.\n“Come on,” Ron muttered.\nThey were over the lake—the castle was right ahead—Ron put his foot\ndown.\nThere was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died completely.\n“Uh-oh,” said Ron, into the silence.\nThe nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed,\nheading straight for the solid castle wall.\n“Noooooo!” Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they\nmissed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring\nover the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the\nblack lawns, losing altitude all the time.\nRon let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of\nhis back pocket—\n“STOP! STOP!” he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the\nwindshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward\nthem—\n“WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!” Harry bellowed, lunging for the\nsteering wheel, but too late—\nCRUNCH.\nWith an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree\ntrunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt.

Steam was billowing\nfrom under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golf-ball-\nsized lump was throbbing on Harry’s head where he had hit the windshield;\nand to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing groan.\n“Are you okay?” Harry said urgently.\n“My wand,” said Ron, in a shaky voice. “Look at my wand—”\nIt had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by\na few splinters.\nHarry opened his mouth to say he was sure they’d be able to mend it\nup at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment,\nsomething hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending\nhim lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof.\n“What’s happen—?”\nRon gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around\njust in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The tree they\nhad hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and its\ngnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach.\n“Aaargh!” said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into\nhis door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from\nknuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding\nfuriously on the roof, which seemed to be caving—\n“Run for it!” Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door,\nbut next second he had been knocked backward into Harry’s lap by a\nvicious uppercut from another branch.\n“We’re done for!” he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the\nfloor of the car was vibrating—the engine had restarted.\n“Reverse!” Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still\ntrying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped\nitself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.\n“That,” panted Ron, “was close. Well done, car—”\nThe car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp\nclunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next thing\nhe knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told him that the\ncar was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig’s cage flew through\nthe air and burst open; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off\ntoward the castle without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and\nsteaming, the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing\nangrily.\n“Come back!” Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand.\n“Dad’ll kill me!”\nBut the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust.\n“Can you believe our luck?” said Ron miserably, bending down to pick\nup Scabbers. “Of all the trees we could’ve hit, we had to get one that hits\nback.”\nHe glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still\nflailing its branches threateningly."

Stiff, cold, and\nbruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the\ngrassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.\n“I think the feast’s already started,” said Ron, dropping his trunk at the\nfoot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit\nwindow. “Hey—Harry—come and look—it’s the Sorting!”\nHarry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great\nHall.\nInnumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long, crowded\ntables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle. Overhead, the\nbewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with\nstars.\nThrough the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long\nline of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall. Ginny was among\nthem, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile,\nProfessor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun,\nwas placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the\nnewcomers.\nEvery year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new\nstudents into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw,\nand Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago,\nand waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a\nfew horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in\nSlytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards\nthan any other—but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron,\nHermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had\nhelped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the\nfirst time in seven years.\nA very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the\nhat on his head. Harry’s eyes wandered past him to where Professor\nDumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table,\nhis long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the\ncandlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in\nrobes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy,\ndrinking deeply from his goblet.\n“Hang on…” Harry muttered to Ron. “There’s an empty chair at the\nstaff table… Where’s Snape?”\nProfessor Severus Snape was Harry’s least favorite teacher. Harry also\nhappened to be Snape’s least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked\nby everybody except the students from his own House (Slytherin), Snape\ntaught Potions.\n“Maybe he’s ill!” said Ron hopefully.\n“Maybe he’s left,” said Harry, “because he missed out on the Defense\nAgainst the Dark Arts job again!”\n“Or he might have been sacked!” said Ron enthusiastically. “I mean,"

There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze,\nstood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose,\nand greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling\nin a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble.\n“Follow me,” said Snape.\nNot daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape\nup the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming\ntorches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but\nSnape led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone\nstaircase that led into the dungeons.\n“In!” he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and\npointing.\nThey entered Snape’s office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined\nwith shelves of large glass jars, in which floated all manner of revolting\nthings Harry didn’t really want to know the name of at the moment. The\nfireplace was dark and empty. Snape closed the door and turned to look at\nthem.\n“So,” he said softly, “the train isn’t good enough for the famous Harry\nPotter and his faithful sidekick, Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang, did\nwe, boys?”\n“No, sir, it was the barrier at King’s Cross, it—”\n“Silence!” said Snape coldly. “What have you done with the car?”\nRon gulped. This wasn’t the first time Snape had given Harry the\nimpression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he understood,\nas Snape unrolled today’s issue of the Evening Prophet.\n“You were seen,” he hissed, showing them the headline: FLYING\nFORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read aloud: “Two\nMuggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post\nOffice tower… at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out\nher washing… Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police… Six or\nseven Muggles in all. I believe your father works in the Misuse of Muggle\nArtifacts Office?” he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily.\n“Dear, dear… his own son…”\nHarry felt as though he’d just been walloped in the stomach by one of\nthe mad tree’s larger branches. If anyone found out Mr. Weasley had\nbewitched the car… he hadn’t thought of that…\n“I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage seems\nto have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,” Snape went on.\n“That tree did more damage to us than we—” Ron blurted out.\n“Silence!” snapped Snape again. “Most unfortunately, you are not in\nmy House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me. I shall go"

        "text": "“Silence!” snapped Snape again. “Most unfortunately, you are not in\nmy House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me. I shall go\nand fetch the people who do have that happy power. You will wait here.”\nHarry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn’t feel\nhungry anymore. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not to look at a large,\nslimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape’s desk.\nIf Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor\nHouse, they were hardly any better off. She might be fairer than Snape, but\nshe was still extremely strict.\nTen minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor\nMcGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor McGonagall\nangry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten just how thin her\nmouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry before. She raised her\nwand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, but she merely\npointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted.\n“Sit,” she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire.\n“Explain,” she said, her glasses glinting ominously.\nRon launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station\nrefusing to let them through.\n“—so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn’t get on the train.”\n“Why didn’t you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?”\nProfessor McGonagall said coldly to Harry.\nHarry gaped at her. Now she’d said it, that seemed the obvious thing to\nhave done.\n“I—I didn’t think—”\n“That,” said Professor McGonagall, “is obvious.”\nThere was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier\nthan ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore.\nHarry’s whole body went numb. Dumbledore was looking unusually\ngrave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and Harry suddenly\nfound himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the\nWhomping Willow.\nThere was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, “Please explain why\nyou did this.”\nIt would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the\ndisappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look\nDumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told\nDumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car,\nmaking it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car\nparked outside the station. He knew Dumbledore would see through this at\nonce, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car. When Harry had\nfinished, he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles.\n“We’ll go and get our stuff,” said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.\n“What are you talking about, Weasley?” barked Professor\nMcGonagall.\n“Well, you’re expelling us, aren’t you?” said Ron.\nHarry looked quickly at Dumbledore.\n“Not today, Mr. Weasley,” said Dumbledore. “But I must impress upon\nboth of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to both\nyour families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything like this"

I must also warn you that if you do anything like this\nagain, I will have no choice but to expel you.”\nSnape looked as though Christmas had been canceled. He cleared his\nthroat and said, “Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree\nfor the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old\nand valuable tree—surely acts of this nature—”\n“It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys’\npunishments, Severus,” said Dumbledore calmly. “They are in her House\nand are therefore her responsibility.” He turned to Professor McGonagall. “I\nmust go back to the feast, Minerva, I’ve got to give out a few notices.\nCome, Severus, there’s a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample—”\nSnape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed\nhimself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Professor\nMcGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.\n“You’d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you’re\nbleeding.”\n“Not much,” said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his\nsleeve. “Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted—”\n“The Sorting Ceremony is over,” said Professor McGonagall. “Your\nsister is also in Gryffindor.”\n“Oh, good,” said Ron.\n“And speaking of Gryffindor—” Professor McGonagall said sharply,\nbut Harry cut in: “Professor, when we took the car, term hadn’t started, so—\nso Gryffindor shouldn’t really have points taken from it—should it?” he\nfinished, watching her anxiously.\nProfessor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure she\nhad almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway.\n“I will not take any points from Gryffindor,” she said, and Harry’s\nheart lightened considerably. “But you will both get a detention.”\nIt was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore’s writing to\nthe Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly well they’d just be\ndisappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn’t squashed him flat.\nProfessor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape’s\ndesk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of iced\npumpkin juice appeared with a pop.\n“You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,” she\nsaid. “I must also return to the feast.”\nWhen the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle.\n“I thought we’d had it,” he said, grabbing a sandwich.\n“So did I,” said Harry, taking one, too.\n“Can you believe our luck, though?” said Ron thickly through a\nmouthful of chicken and ham. “Fred and George must’ve flown that car five\nor six times and no Muggle ever saw them.” He swallowed and took\nanother huge bite. “Why couldn’t we get through the barrier?”\nHarry shrugged. “We’ll have to watch our step from now on, though,”\nhe said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. “Wish we could’ve gone"

The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast was over.\nThey walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor, and\nclimbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage\nwhere the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil\npainting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\n“Password?” she said as they approached.\n“Er—” said Harry.\nThey didn’t know the new year’s password, not having met a\nGryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard\nhurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing toward\nthem.\n“There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors—\nsomeone said you’d been expelled for crashing a flying car—”\n“Well, we haven’t been expelled,” Harry assured her.\n“You’re not telling me you did fly here?” said Hermione, sounding\nalmost as severe as Professor McGonagall.\n“Skip the lecture,” said Ron impatiently, “and tell us the new\npassword.”\n“It’s ‘wattlebird,’” said Hermione impatiently, “but that’s not the point\n—”\nHer words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady\nswung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as though\nthe whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular\ncommon room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs,\nwaiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull\nHarry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after them.\n“Brilliant!” yelled Lee Jordan. “Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a\ncar right into the Whomping Willow, people’ll be talking about that one for\nyears—”\n“Good for you,” said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone\nwas patting him on the back as though he’d just won a marathon; Fred and\nGeorge pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, “Why\ncouldn’t we’ve come in the car, eh?” Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning\nembarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn’t look happy at all.\nPercy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed\nto be trying to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron\nin the ribs and nodded in Percy’s direction. Ron got the point at once.\n“Got to get upstairs—bit tired,” he said, and the two of them started\npushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led\nto a spiral staircase and the dormitories.\n“’Night,” Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl\njust like Percy’s.\nThey managed to get to the other side of the common room, still"

They\nhurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old\ndormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS. They\nentered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters hung with red\nvelvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had been brought up for\nthem and stood at the ends of their beds.\nRon grinned guiltily at Harry.\n“I know I shouldn’t’ve enjoyed that or anything, but—”\nThe dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year\nGryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom.\n“Unbelievable!” beamed Seamus.\n“Cool,” said Dean.\n“Amazing,” said Neville, awestruck.\nHarry couldn’t help it. He grinned, too.\nC\nHAPTER 6\nG L\nILDEROY OCKHART\nThe next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go\ndownhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long House tables were\nladen with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and\ndishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull,\ncloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to\nHermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open\nagainst a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way she said\n“’Morning,” which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way\nthey had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them\ncheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the\nworst memory of anyone Harry had ever met.\n“Mail’s due any minute—I think Gran’s sending a few things I forgot.”\nHarry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a\nrushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the\nhall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A big,\nlumpy package bounced off Neville’s head and, a second later, something\nlarge and gray fell into Hermione’s jug, spraying them all with milk and\nfeathers.\n“Errol!” said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol\nslumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red\nenvelope in his beak.\n“Oh, no—” Ron gasped.\n“It’s all right, he’s still alive,” said Hermione, prodding Errol gently\nwith the tip of her finger.\n“It’s not that—it’s that.”\nRon was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to\nHarry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected\nit to explode.\n“What’s the matter?” said Harry.\n“She’s—she’s sent me a Howler,” said Ron faintly.\n“You’d better open it, Ron,” said Neville in a timid whisper. “It’ll be"

My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and”—he\ngulped—“it was horrible.”\nHarry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.\n“What’s a Howler?” he said.\nBut Ron’s whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to\nsmoke at the corners.\n“Open it,” Neville urged. “It’ll all be over in a few minutes—”\nRon stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol’s\nbeak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split second\nlater, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of\nsound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling.\n“—STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN\nSURPRISED IF THEY’D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET\nHOLD OF YOU, I DON’T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK\nWHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT\nWAS GONE—”\nMrs. Weasley’s yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the\nplates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone\nwalls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had\nreceived the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson\nforehead could be seen.\n“—LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT\nYOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN’T BRING YOU\nUP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE\nDIED—”\nHarry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He\ntried very hard to look as though he couldn’t hear the voice that was making\nhis eardrums throb.\n“—ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED—YOUR FATHER’S FACING AN\nINQUIRY AT WORK, IT’S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU\nPUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT\nBACK HOME.”\nA ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from\nRon’s hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat\nstunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people\nlaughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.\nHermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of\nRon’s head.\n“Well, I don’t know what you expected, Ron, but you—”\n“Don’t tell me I deserved it,” snapped Ron.\nHarry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt.\nMr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley\nhad done for him over the summer…\nBut he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was\nmoving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. Harry\ntook his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first."

        "text": "moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. Harry\ntook his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the\nvegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants\nwere kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed\nto think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly\nfriendly again.\nAs they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing\noutside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only\njust joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn,\naccompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor Sprout’s arms were full of\nbandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the Whomping\nWillow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings.\nProfessor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over\nher flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes\nand her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy Lockhart,\nhowever, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair\nshining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming.\n“Oh, hello there!” he called, beaming around at the assembled\nstudents. “Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a\nWhomping Willow! But I don’t want you running away with the idea that\nI’m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met several of\nthese exotic plants on my travels…”\n“Greenhouse three today, chaps!” said Professor Sprout, who was\nlooking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.\nThere was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in\ngreenhouse one before—greenhouse three housed far more interesting and\ndangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and\nunlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer\nmingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers\ndangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside\nwhen Lockhart’s hand shot out.\n“Harry! I’ve been wanting a word—you don’t mind if he’s a couple of\nminutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?”\nJudging by Professor Sprout’s scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said,\n“That’s the ticket,” and closed the greenhouse door in her face.\n“Harry,” said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight\nas he shook his head. “Harry, Harry, Harry.”\nCompletely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.\n“When I heard—well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked\nmyself.”\nHarry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so\nwhen Lockhart went on, “Don’t know when I’ve been more shocked.\nFlying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you’d done\nit. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.”\nIt was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth\neven when he wasn’t talking.\n“Gave you a taste for publicity, didn’t I?” said Lockhart. “Gave you"

You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you couldn’t\nwait to do it again.”\n“Oh, no, Professor, see—”\n“Harry, Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his\nshoulder. “I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you’ve had that\nfirst taste—and I blame myself for giving you that, because it was bound to\ngo to your head—but see here, young man, you can’t start flying cars to try\nand get yourself noticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for all\nthat when you’re older. Yes, yes, I know what you’re thinking! ‘It’s all right\nfor him, he’s an internationally famous wizard already!’ But when I was\ntwelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, I’d say I was\neven more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven’t\nthey? All that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” He glanced at\nthe lightning scar on Harry’s forehead. “I know, I know—it’s not quite as\ngood as winning Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award five times in\na row, as I have—but it’s a start, Harry, it’s a start.”\nHe gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a\nfew seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse,\nhe opened the door and slid inside.\nProfessor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of\nthe greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear-muffs were\nlying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place between Ron and\nHermione, she said, “We’ll be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can\ntell me the properties of the Mandrake?”\nTo nobody’s surprise, Hermione’s hand was first into the air.\n“Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,” said Hermione,\nsounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. “It is used to\nreturn people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.”\n“Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,” said Professor Sprout. “The\nMandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also, however,\ndangerous. Who can tell me why?”\nHermione’s hand narrowly missed Harry’s glasses as it shot up again.\n“The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,” she said\npromptly.\n“Precisely. Take another ten points,” said Professor Sprout. “Now, the\nMandrakes we have here are still very young.”\nShe pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled\nforward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green\nin color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to\nHarry, who didn’t have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the “cry”\nof the Mandrake.\n“Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,” said Professor Sprout."

        "text": "Harry, who didn’t have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the “cry”\nof the Mandrake.\n“Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,” said Professor Sprout.\nThere was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn’t pink\nand fluffy.\n“When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely\ncovered,” said Professor Sprout. “When it is safe to remove them, I will\ngive you the thumbs-up. Right—earmuffs on.”\nHarry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound\ncompletely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears,\nrolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and\npulled hard.\nHarry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.\nInstead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out\nof the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale\ngreen, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs.\nProfessor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and\nplunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until\nonly the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands,\ngave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.\n“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won’t kill yet,” she\nsaid calmly as though she’d just done nothing more exciting than water a\nbegonia. “However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I’m\nsure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs\nare securely in place while you work. I will attract your attention when it is\ntime to pack up.\n“Four to a tray—there is a large supply of pots here—compost in the\nsacks over there—and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula, it’s teething.”\nShe gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it\ndraw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired\nHufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.\n“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand.\n“Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter… And you’re\nHermione Granger—always top in everything” (Hermione beamed as she\nhad her hand shaken too) “—and Ron Weasley. Wasn’t that your flying\ncar?”\nRon didn’t smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.\n“That Lockhart’s something, isn’t he?” said Justin happily as they\nbegan filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. “Awfully brave\nchap. Have you read his books? I’d have died of fear if I’d been cornered in\na telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and—zap—just\nfantastic.\n“My name was down for Eton, you know.

Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but\nsince I made her read Lockhart’s books I think she’s begun to see how\nuseful it’ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family…”\nAfter that they didn’t have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were\nback on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout\nhad made it look extremely easy, but it wasn’t. The Mandrakes didn’t like\ncoming out of the earth, but didn’t seem to want to go back into it either.\nThey squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their\nteeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one\ninto a pot.\nBy the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching,\nand covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash\nand then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.\nProfessor McGonagall’s classes were always hard work, but today was\nespecially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have\nleaked out of his head during the summer. He was supposed to be turning a\nbeetle into a button, but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of\nexercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.\nRon was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with\nsome borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It\nkept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to\ntransfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of\nrotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed\nhis beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor\nMcGonagall wasn’t pleased.\nHarry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung\nsponge. Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was\nwhacking his wand furiously on the desk.\n“Stupid—useless—thing—”\n“Write home for another one,” Harry suggested as the wand let off a\nvolley of bangs like a firecracker.\n“Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,” said Ron, stuffing the now\nhissing wand into his bag. “‘It’s your own fault your wand got snapped—’”\nThey went down to lunch, where Ron’s mood was not improved by\nHermione’s showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had\nproduced in Transfiguration.\n“What’ve we got this afternoon?” said Harry, hastily changing the\nsubject.\n“Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said Hermione at once.\n“Why,” demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, “have you outlined all\nLockhart’s lessons in little hearts?”\nHermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.\nThey finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard.\nHermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with\nVampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several\nminutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched.\nLooking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he’d seen trying on\nthe Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed.

He was\nclutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment\nHarry looked at him, he went bright red.\n“All right, Harry? I’m—I’m Colin Creevey,” he said breathlessly,\ntaking a tentative step forward. “I’m in Gryffindor, too. D’you think—\nwould it be all right if—can I have a picture?” he said, raising the camera\nhopefully.\n“A picture?” Harry repeated blankly.\n“So I can prove I’ve met you,” said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging\nfurther forward. “I know all about you. Everyone’s told me. About how you\nsurvived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared\nand everything and how you’ve still got a lightning scar on your forehead”\n(his eyes raked Harry’s hairline) “and a boy in my dormitory said if I\ndevelop the film in the right potion, the pictures’ll move.” Colin drew a\ngreat shuddering breath of excitement and said, “It’s amazing here, isn’t it?\nI never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from\nHogwarts. My dad’s a milkman, he couldn’t believe it either. So I’m taking\nloads of pictures to send home to him. And it’d be really good if I had one\nof you”—he looked imploringly at Harry—“maybe your friend could take it\nand I could stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?”\n“Signed photos? You’re giving out signed photos, Potter?”\nLoud and scathing, Draco Malfoy’s voice echoed around the courtyard.\nHe had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts,\nby his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle.\n“Everyone line up!” Malfoy roared to the crowd. “Harry Potter’s\ngiving out signed photos!”\n“No, I’m not,” said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. “Shut up,\nMalfoy.”\n“You’re just jealous,” piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as\nthick as Crabbe’s neck.\n“Jealous?” said Malfoy, who didn’t need to shout anymore: Half the\ncourtyard was listening in. “Of what? I don’t want a foul scar right across\nmy head, thanks. I don’t think getting your head cut open makes you that\nspecial, myself.”\nCrabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.\n“Eat slugs, Malfoy,” said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and\nstarted rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way.\n“Be careful, Weasley,” sneered Malfoy. “You don’t want to start any\ntrouble or your mommy’ll have to come and take you away from school.”\nHe put on a shrill, piercing voice. “If you put another toe out of line—”\nA knot of Slytherin fifth years nearby laughed loudly at this.\n“Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,” smirked Malfoy. “It’d be\nworth more than his family’s whole house—”\nRon whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages\nwith Vampires with a snap and whispered, “Look out!”\n“What’s all this, what’s all this?” Gilderoy Lockhart was striding"

We\nmeet again, Harry!”\nPinned to Lockhart’s side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw\nMalfoy slide smirking back into the crowd.\n“Come on then, Mr. Creevey,” said Lockhart, beaming at Colin. “A\ndouble portrait, can’t do better than that, and we’ll both sign it for you.”\nColin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang\nbehind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes.\n“Off you go, move along there,” Lockhart called to the crowd, and he\nset off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he knew a good\nVanishing Spell, still clasped to his side.\n“A word to the wise, Harry,” said Lockhart paternally as they entered\nthe building through a side door. “I covered up for you back there with\nyoung Creevey—if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won’t\nthink you’re setting yourself up so much…”\nDeaf to Harry’s stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined\nwith staring students and up a staircase.\n“Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your\ncareer isn’t sensible—looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may\nwell come a time when, like me, you’ll need to keep a stack handy\nwherever you go, but”—he gave a little chortle—“I don’t think you’re quite\nthere yet.”\nThey had reached Lockhart’s classroom and he let Harry go at last.\nHarry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the\nclass, where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart’s books in\nfront of him, so that he could avoid looking at the real thing.\nThe rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat\ndown on either side of Harry.\n“You could’ve fried an egg on your face,” said Ron. “You’d better\nhope Creevey doesn’t meet Ginny, or they’ll be starting a Harry Potter fan\nclub.”\n“Shut up,” snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart\nto hear the phrase “Harry Potter fan club.”\nWhen the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly\nand silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom’s copy\nof Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on\nthe front.\n“Me,” he said, pointing at it and winking as well. “Gilderoy Lockhart,\nOrder of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense\nLeague, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile\nAward—but I don’t talk about that. I didn’t get rid of the Bandon Banshee\nby smiling at her!”\nHe waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly."

I\nthought we’d start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about—just to\ncheck how well you’ve read them, how much you’ve taken in—”\nWhen he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the\nclass and said, “You have thirty minutes—start—now!”\nHarry looked down at his paper and read:\n1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s favorite color?\n2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s secret ambition?\n3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart’s greatest achievement\nto date?\nOn and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:\n54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart’s birthday, and what would his ideal\ngift be?\nHalf an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through\nthem in front of the class.\n“Tut, tut—hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is\nlilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read\nWanderings with Werewolves more carefully—I clearly state in chapter\ntwelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and\nnon-magic peoples—though I wouldn’t say no to a large bottle of Ogden’s\nOld Firewhisky!”\nHe gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at Lockhart\nwith an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean\nThomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter.\nHermione, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention\nand gave a start when he mentioned her name.\n“…but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the\nworld of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions—good girl! In\nfact”—he flipped her paper over—“full marks! Where is Miss Hermione\nGranger?”\nHermione raised a trembling hand.\n“Excellent!” beamed Lockhart. “Quite excellent! Take ten points for\nGryffindor! And so—to business—”\nHe bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it.\n“Now—be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest\ncreatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst\nfears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.\nAll I ask is that you remain calm.”\nIn spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better\nlook at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus\nhad stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row seat.\n“I must ask you not to scream,” said Lockhart in a low voice. “It might\nprovoke them.”\nAs the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover.\n“Yes,” he said dramatically. “Freshly caught Cornish pixies.”\nSeamus Finnigan couldn’t control himself. He let out a snort of\nlaughter that even Lockhart couldn’t mistake for a scream of terror.\n“Yes?” He smiled at Seamus."

The pixies shot in every direction like rockets.\nTwo of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air. Several\nshot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken\nglass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a\nrampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them,\nshredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste\nbasket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed\nwindow; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and\nNeville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling.\n“Come on now—round them up, round them up, they’re only pixies,”\nLockhart shouted.\nHe rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed,\n“Peskipiksi Pesternomi!”\nIt had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw\nit out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk,\nnarrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the\nchandelier gave way.\nThe bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative\ncalm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron,\nand Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, “Well, I’ll ask you\nthree to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.” He swept past them\nand shut the door quickly behind him.\n“Can you believe him?” roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit\nhim painfully on the ear.\n“He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,” said Hermione,\nimmobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing\nthem back into their cage.\n“Hands on?” said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of\nreach with its tongue out. “Hermione, he didn’t have a clue what he was\ndoing—”\n“Rubbish,” said Hermione. “You’ve read his books—look at all those\namazing things he’s done—”\n“He says he’s done,” Ron muttered.\nC\nHAPTER 7\nM M\nUDBLOODS AND URMURS\nHarry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight\nwhenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor.

Harder to\navoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry’s\nschedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, “All\nright, Harry?” six or seven times a day and hear, “Hello, Colin,” back,\nhowever exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.\nHedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey\nand Ron’s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday\nmorning by shooting out of Ron’s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old\nProfessor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing\ngreen boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was\nquite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to\nvisit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake\nseveral hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of\nthe Gryffindor Quidditch team.\n“Whassamatter?” said Harry groggily.\n“Quidditch practice!” said Wood. “Come on!”\nHarry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across\nthe pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn’t understand how\nhe could have slept through the racket the birds were making.\n“Oliver,” Harry croaked. “It’s the crack of dawn.”\n“Exactly,” said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the\nmoment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. “It’s part of our\nnew training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let’s go,” said Wood\nheartily. “None of the other teams have started training yet; we’re going to\nbe first off the mark this year—”\nYawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to\nfind his Quidditch robes.\n“Good man,” said Wood. “Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.”\nWhen he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for\nwarmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he’d gone and\nwent down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two\nThousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when there\nwas a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral\nstaircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something\nclutched in his hand.\n“I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what\nI’ve got here! I’ve had it developed, I wanted to show you—”\nHarry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing\nunder his nose.\nA moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm\nHarry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his photographic\nself was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. As\nHarry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, panting, against the white\nedge of the picture.\n“Will you sign it?” said Colin eagerly.\n“No,” said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was"

Wait for me! I’ve never watched a Quidditch game\nbefore!”\nColin scrambled through the hole after him.\n“It’ll be really boring,” Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his\nface shining with excitement.\n“You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren’t you,\nHarry? Weren’t you?” said Colin, trotting alongside him. “You must be\nbrilliant. I’ve never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the\nbest one there is?”\nHarry didn’t know how to get rid of him. It was like having an\nextremely talkative shadow.\n“I don’t really understand Quidditch,” said Colin breathlessly. “Is it\ntrue there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people\noff their brooms?”\n“Yes,” said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules\nof Quidditch. “They’re called Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team\nwho carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George\nWeasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.”\n“And what are the other balls for?” Colin asked, tripping down a\ncouple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry.\n“Well, the Quaffle—that’s the biggish red one—is the one that scores\ngoals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try\nand get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch—they’re three long\npoles with hoops on the end.”\n“And the fourth ball—”\n“—is the Golden Snitch,” said Harry, “and it’s very small, very fast,\nand difficult to catch. But that’s what the Seeker’s got to do, because a game\nof Quidditch doesn’t end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever\nteam’s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty\npoints.”\n“And you’re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren’t you?” said Colin in awe.\n“Yes,” said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew-\ndrenched grass. “And there’s the Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts.\nThat’s it, really.”\nBut Colin didn’t stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping\nlawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached\nthe changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, “I’ll go and\nget a good seat, Harry!” and hurried off to the stands.\nThe rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room.\nWood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George\nWeasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year\nAlicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her.\nHer fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side\nby side opposite them.\n“There you are, Harry, what kept you?” said Wood briskly. “Now, I"

        "text": "Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side\nby side opposite them.\n“There you are, Harry, what kept you?” said Wood briskly. “Now, I\nwanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field,\nbecause I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I\nreally think will make all the difference…”\nWood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which\nwere drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in different-colored inks. He\ntook out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over\nthe diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a speech about his new\ntactics, Fred Weasley’s head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet’s shoulder\nand he began to snore.\nThe first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was\nanother board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a\nstupor as Wood droned on and on.\n“So,” said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy\nabout what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the\ncastle. “Is that clear? Any questions?”\n“I’ve got a question, Oliver,” said George, who had woken with a start.\n“Why couldn’t you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?”\nWood wasn’t pleased.\n“Now, listen here, you lot,” he said, glowering at them all. “We should\nhave won the Quidditch Cup last year. We’re easily the best team. But\nunfortunately—owing to circumstances beyond our control—”\nHarry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the\nhospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that\nGryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in\nthree hundred years.\nWood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat\nwas clearly still torturing him.\n“So this year, we train harder than ever before… Okay, let’s go and put\nour new theories into practice!” Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and\nleading the way out of the locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still yawning, his\nteam followed.\nThey had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up\ncompletely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the\nstadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting\nin the stands.\n“Aren’t you finished yet?” called Ron incredulously.\n“Haven’t even started,” said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and\nmarmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. “Wood’s\nbeen teaching us new moves.”\nHe mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into\nthe air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more\neffectively than Wood’s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the\nQuidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing\nFred and George.\n“What’s that funny clicking noise?” called Fred as they hurtled around\nthe corner.\nHarry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest\nseats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely\nmagnified in the deserted stadium."

Colin was sitting in one of the highest\nseats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely\nmagnified in the deserted stadium.\n“Look this way, Harry! This way!” he cried shrilly.\n“Who’s that?” said Fred.\n“No idea,” Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far\naway as possible from Colin.\n“What’s going on?” said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the\nair toward them. “Why’s that first year taking pictures? I don’t like it. He\ncould be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.”\n“He’s in Gryffindor,” said Harry quickly.\n“And the Slytherins don’t need a spy, Oliver,” said George.\n“What makes you say that?” said Wood testily.\n“Because they’re here in person,” said George, pointing.\nSeveral people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks\nin their hands.\n“I don’t believe it!” Wood hissed in outrage. “I booked the field for\ntoday! We’ll see about this!”\nWood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to\nin his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George\nfollowed.\n“Flint!” Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. “This is our practice\ntime! We got up specially! You can clear off now!”\nMarcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish\ncunning on his face as he replied, “Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.”\nAngelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on\nthe Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors,\nleering to a man.\n“But I booked the field!” said Wood, positively spitting with rage. “I\nbooked it!”\n“Ah,” said Flint. “But I’ve got a specially signed note here from\nProfessor Snape. ‘I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission\nto practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new\nSeeker.’”\n“You’ve got a new Seeker?” said Wood, distracted. “Where?”\nAnd from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh,\nsmaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy.\n“Aren’t you Lucius Malfoy’s son?” said Fred, looking at Malfoy with\ndislike.\n“Funny you should mention Draco’s father,” said Flint as the whole\nSlytherin team smiled still more broadly. “Let me show you the generous\ngift he’s made to the Slytherin team.”\nAll seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished,\nbrand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words\nNimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors’ noses in\nthe early morning sun.\n“Very latest model. Only came out last month,” said Flint carelessly,\nflicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. “I believe it outstrips the\nold Two Thousand series by a considerable amount.

        "text": "old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old\nCleansweeps”—he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both\nclutching Cleansweep Fives—“sweeps the board with them.”\nNone of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a\nmoment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to\nslits.\n“Oh, look,” said Flint. “A field invasion.”\nRon and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.\n“What’s happening?” Ron asked Harry. “Why aren’t you playing? And\nwhat’s he doing here?”\nHe was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.\n“I’m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,” said Malfoy, smugly.\n“Everyone’s just been admiring the brooms my father’s bought our team.”\nRon gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of\nhim.\n“Good, aren’t they?” said Malfoy smoothly. “But perhaps the\nGryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too.\nYou could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid\nfor them.”\nThe Slytherin team howled with laughter.\n“At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,” said\nHermione sharply. “They got in on pure talent.”\nThe smug look on Malfoy’s face flickered.\n“No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,” he spat.\nHarry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because\nthere was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy\nto stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, “How dare you!”,\nand Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling,\n“You’ll pay for that one, Malfoy!” and pointed it furiously under Flint’s arm\nat Malfoy’s face.\nA loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot\nout of the wrong end of Ron’s wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending\nhim reeling backward onto the grass.\n“Ron! Ron! Are you all right?” squealed Hermione.\nRon opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he\ngave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his\nlap.\nThe Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled\nup, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours,\nbanging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were gathered around\nRon, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to\ntouch him.\n“We’d better get him to Hagrid’s, it’s nearest,” said Harry to\nHermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the\narms.\n“What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure\nhim, can’t you?” Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing\nalongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs\ndribbled down his front.\n“Oooh,” said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. “Can you hold"

Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs\ndribbled down his front.\n“Oooh,” said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. “Can you hold\nhim still, Harry?”\n“Get out of the way, Colin!” said Harry angrily. He and Hermione\nsupported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of\nthe forest.\n“Nearly there, Ron,” said Hermione as the gamekeeper’s cabin came\ninto view. “You’ll be all right in a minute—almost there—”\nThey were within twenty feet of Hagrid’s house when the front door\nopened, but it wasn’t Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing\nrobes of palest mauve today, came striding out.\n“Quick, behind here,” Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby\nbush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly.\n“It’s a simple matter if you know what you’re doing!” Lockhart was\nsaying loudly to Hagrid. “If you need help, you know where I am! I’ll let\nyou have a copy of my book. I’m surprised you haven’t already got one—\nI’ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!” And he strode away\ntoward the castle.\nHarry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of\nthe bush and up to Hagrid’s front door. They knocked urgently.\nHagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression\nbrightened when he saw who it was.\n“Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me—come in, come in—\nthought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again—”\nHarry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one-\nroomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling\nmerrily in the other. Hagrid didn’t seem perturbed by Ron’s slug problem,\nwhich Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a chair.\n“Better out than in,” he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin\nin front of him. “Get ’em all up, Ron.”\n“I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it to stop,” said\nHermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. “That’s a difficult\ncurse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand—”\nHagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang,\nwas slobbering over Harry.\n“What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?” Harry asked, scratching\nFang’s ears.\n“Givin’ me advice on gettin’ kelpies out of a well,” growled Hagrid,\nmoving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the\nteapot. “Like I don’ know. An’ bangin’ on about some banshee he banished.\nIf one word of it was true, I’ll eat my kettle.”\nIt was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts teacher, and Harry\nlooked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat\nhigher than usual, “I think you’re being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore\nobviously thought he was the best man for the job—”\n“He was the on’y man for the job,” said Hagrid, offering them a plate"

Gettin’ very difficult ter find anyone fer the Dark Arts job.\nPeople aren’t too keen ter take it on, see. They’re startin’ ter think it’s\njinxed. No one’s lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,” said Hagrid,\njerking his head at Ron. “Who was he tryin’ ter curse?”\n“Malfoy called Hermione something—it must’ve been really bad,\nbecause everyone went wild.”\n“It was bad,” said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking\npale and sweaty. “Malfoy called her ‘Mudblood,’ Hagrid—”\nRon dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their\nappearance. Hagrid looked outraged.\n“He didn’!” he growled at Hermione.\n“He did,” she said. “But I don’t know what it means. I could tell it was\nreally rude, of course—”\n“It’s about the most insulting thing he could think of,” gasped Ron,\ncoming back up. “Mudblood’s a really foul name for someone who is\nMuggle-born—you know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards—\nlike Malfoy’s family—who think they’re better than everyone else because\nthey’re what people call pure-blood.” He gave a small burp, and a single\nslug fell into his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin and\ncontinued, “I mean, the rest of us know it doesn’t make any difference at\nall. Look at Neville Longbottom—he’s pure-blood and he can hardly stand\na cauldron the right way up.”\n“An’ they haven’t invented a spell our Hermione can’ do,” said Hagrid\nproudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta.\n“It’s a disgusting thing to call someone,” said Ron, wiping his sweaty\nbrow with a shaking hand. “Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It’s\nridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn’t\nmarried Muggles we’d’ve died out.”\nHe retched and ducked out of sight again.\n“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron,” said Hagrid\nloudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. “Bu’ maybe it was a\ngood thing yer wand backfired. ’Spect Lucius Malfoy would’ve come\nmarchin’ up ter school if yeh’d cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble.”\nHarry would have pointed out that trouble didn’t come much worse\nthan having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn’t; Hagrid’s\ntreacle toffee had cemented his jaws together.\n“Harry,” said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought.\n“Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I’ve heard you’ve bin givin’ out signed\nphotos. How come I haven’t got one?”\nFurious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.\n“I have not been giving out signed photos,” he said hotly. “If"

How come I haven’t got one?”\nFurious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.\n“I have not been giving out signed photos,” he said hotly. “If\nLockhart’s still spreading that around—”\nBut then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.\n“I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patting Harry genially on the back and\nsending him face first into the table. “I knew yeh hadn’t really. I told\nLockhart yeh didn’ need teh. Yer more famous than him without tryin’.”\n“Bet he didn’t like that,” said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.\n“Don’ think he did,” said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. “An’ then I told\nhim I’d never read one o’ his books an’ he decided ter go. Treacle toffee,\nRon?” he added as Ron reappeared.\n“No thanks,” said Ron weakly. “Better not risk it.”\n“Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said Hagrid as Harry and\nHermione finished the last of their tea.\nIn the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid’s house were a dozen of\nthe largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a large\nboulder.\n“Gettin’ on well, aren’t they?” said Hagrid happily. “Fer the Halloween\nfeast… should be big enough by then.”\n“What’ve you been feeding them?” said Harry.\nHagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.\n“Well, I’ve bin givin’ them—you know—a bit o’ help—”\nHarry noticed Hagrid’s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back\nwall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that this\numbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression that\nHagrid’s old school wand was concealed inside it. Hagrid wasn’t supposed\nto use magic. He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but\nHarry had never found out why—any mention of the matter and Hagrid\nwould clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the\nsubject was changed.\n“An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?” said Hermione, halfway\nbetween disapproval and amusement. “Well, you’ve done a good job on\nthem.”\n“That’s what yer little sister said,” said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. “Met\nher jus’ yesterday.” Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching.\n“Said she was jus’ lookin’ round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin’\nshe might run inter someone else at my house.” He winked at Harry. “If yeh\nask me, she wouldn’ say no ter a signed—”\n“Oh, shut up,” said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground\nwas sprayed with slugs.\n“Watch it!” Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious\npumpkins.\nIt was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle\ntoffee since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat.

Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student\nin the school.\n“And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan\nmail,” said Professor McGonagall.\n“Oh n—Professor, can’t I go and do the trophy room, too?” said Harry\ndesperately.\n“Certainly not,” said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows.\n“Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o’clock sharp, both of\nyou.”\nHarry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom,\nHermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of\nexpression. Harry didn’t enjoy his shepherd’s pie as much as he’d thought.\nBoth he and Ron felt they’d got the worse deal.\n“Filch’ll have me there all night,” said Ron heavily. “No magic! There\nmust be about a hundred cups in that room. I’m no good at Muggle\ncleaning.”\n“I’d swap anytime,” said Harry hollowly. “I’ve had loads of practice\nwith the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart’s fan mail… he’ll be a\nnightmare…”\nSaturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no\ntime, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet along the\nsecond-floor corridor to Lockhart’s office. He gritted his teeth and knocked.\nThe door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him.\n“Ah, here’s the scalawag!” he said. “Come in, Harry, come in—”\nShining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were\ncountless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a few of\nthem. Another large pile lay on his desk.\n“You can address the envelopes!” Lockhart told Harry, as though this\nwas a huge treat. “This first one’s to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her—huge fan\nof mine—”\nThe minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart’s voice wash over him,\noccasionally saying, “Mmm” and “Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then he\ncaught a phrase like, “Fame’s a fickle friend, Harry,” or “Celebrity is as\ncelebrity does, remember that.”\nThe candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the\nmany moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved his aching\nhand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica\nSmethley’s address.

Broke all records!”\n“No,” said Harry frantically. “That voice!”\n“Sorry?” said Lockhart, looking puzzled. “What voice?”\n“That—that voice that said—didn’t you hear it?”\nLockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment.\n“What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you’re getting a little\ndrowsy? Great Scott—look at the time! “We’ve been here nearly four\nhours! I’d never have believed it—the time’s flown, hasn’t it?”\nHarry didn’t answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again,\nbut there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn’t\nexpect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry\nleft.\nIt was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty.\nHarry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn’t back yet. Harry pulled\non his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron arrived,\nnursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened\nroom.\n“My muscles have all seized up,” he groaned, sinking on his bed.\n“Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch Cup before he was\nsatisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for\nServices to the School. Took ages to get the slime off… How was it with\nLockhart?”\nKeeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus,\nHarry told Ron exactly what he had heard.\n“And Lockhart said he couldn’t hear it?” said Ron. Harry could see\nhim frowning in the moonlight. “D’you think he was lying? But I don’t get\nit—even someone invisible would’ve had to open the door.”\n“I know,” said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the\ncanopy above him. “I don’t get it either.”\nC\nHAPTER 8\nT D P\nHE EATHDAY ARTY\nOctober arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the\ncastle.

        "text": "that her whole head was on fire.\nRaindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days\non end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and\nHagrid’s pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood’s\nenthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened,\nwhich was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon\na few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to\nthe skin and splattered with mud. Even aside from the rain and wind it\nhadn’t been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had been\nspying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those\nnew Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin\nteam was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like\nmissiles.\nAs Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across\nsomebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless\nNick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window,\nmuttering under his breath, “…don’t fulfill their requirements… half an\ninch, if that…”\n“Hello, Nick,” said Harry.\n“Hello, hello,” said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round.\nHe wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a\nruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed.\nHe was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark\nsky and torrential rain outside.\n“You look troubled, young Potter,” said Nick, folding a transparent\nletter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.\n“So do you,” said Harry.\n“Ah,” Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, “a matter of no\nimportance… It’s not as though I really wanted to join… Thought I’d apply,\nbut apparently I ‘don’t fulfill requirements’—”\nIn spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.\n“But you would think, wouldn’t you,” he erupted suddenly, pulling the\nletter back out of his pocket, “that getting hit forty-five times in the neck\nwith a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?”\n“Oh—yes,” said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.\n“I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and\nclean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me\na great deal of pain and ridicule. However—” Nearly Headless Nick shook\nhis letter open and read furiously:\n“‘We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted\ncompany with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be\nimpossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such\nas Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest\nregret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our\nrequirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.’”\nFuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.\n“Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most\npeople would think that’s good and beheaded, but oh, no, it’s not enough for\nSir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.”"

Most\npeople would think that’s good and beheaded, but oh, no, it’s not enough for\nSir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.”\nNearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far\ncalmer tone, “So—what’s bothering you? Anything I can do?”\n“No,” said Harry. “Not unless you know where we can get seven free\nNimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly—”\nThe rest of Harry’s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched\nmewling from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found\nhimself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the\nskeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of\ndeputy in his endless battle against students.\n“You’d better get out of here, Harry,” said Nick quickly. “Filch isn’t in\na good mood—he’s got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered\nfrog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He’s been cleaning all\nmorning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place—”\n“Right,” said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs.\nNorris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power\nthat seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly\nthrough a tapestry to Harry’s right, wheezing and looking wildly about for\nthe rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and\nhis nose was unusually purple.\n“Filth!” he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as\nhe pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry’s Quidditch\nrobes. “Mess and muck everywhere! I’ve had enough of it, I tell you!\nFollow me, Potter!”\nSo Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and\nfollowed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints\non the floor.\nHarry had never been inside Filch’s office before; it was a place most\nstudents avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil\nlamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered\nabout the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their\nlabels, Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had\never punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to\nthemselves. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on\nthe wall behind Filch’s desk. It was common knowledge that he was always\nbegging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the\nceiling.\nFilch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling\naround looking for parchment.\n“Dung,” he muttered furiously, “great sizzling dragon bogies… frog\nbrains… rat intestines… I’ve had enough of it… make an example…\nwhere’s the form… yes…”\nHe retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and\nstretched it out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.\n“Name… Harry Potter. Crime…”\n“It was only a bit of mud!” said Harry."

Crime…”\n“It was only a bit of mud!” said Harry.\n“It’s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it’s an extra hour\nscrubbing!” shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his\nbulbous nose. “Crime… befouling the castle… suggested sentence…”\nDabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry,\nwho waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.\nBut as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling\nof the office, which made the oil lamp rattle.\n“PEEVES!” Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage.\n“I’ll have you this time, I’ll have you!”\nAnd without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the\noffice, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him.\nPeeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who\nlived to cause havoc and distress. Harry didn’t much like Peeves, but\ncouldn’t help feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves\nhad done (and it sounded as though he’d wrecked something very big this\ntime) would distract Filch from Harry.\nThinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry\nsank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on\nit apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with\nsilver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that\nFilch wasn’t on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read:\nKWIKSPELL\n—————\nA Correspondence Course in Beginners’ Magic\nIntrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of\nparchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said:\nFeel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself\nmaking excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for\nyour woeful wandwork?\nThere is an answer!\nKwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course.\nHundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell\nmethod!\nMadam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes:\n“I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family\njoke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at\nparties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!”\nWarlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says:\n“My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into\nyour fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a\nyak!\nThank you, Kwikspell!”\nFascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope’s contents.\nWhy on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn’t a\nproper wizard? Harry was just reading “Lesson One: Holding Your Wand\n(Some Useful Tips)” when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was\ncoming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it\nback onto the desk just as the door opened."

        "text": "(Some Useful Tips)” when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was\ncoming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it\nback onto the desk just as the door opened.\nFilch was looking triumphant.\n“That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!” he was saying\ngleefully to Mrs. Norris. “We’ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet—”\nHis eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope,\nwhich, Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had\nstarted.\nFilch’s pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave\nof fury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and\nthrew it into a drawer.\n“Have you—did you read—?” he sputtered.\n“No,” Harry lied quickly.\nFilch’s knobbly hands were twisting together.\n“If I thought you’d read my private—not that it’s mine—for a friend—\nbe that as it may—however—”\nHarry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His\neyes were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the\ntartan scarf didn’t help.\n“Very well—go—and don’t breathe a word—not that—however, if\nyou didn’t read—go now, I have to write up Peeves’ report—go—”\nAmazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and\nback upstairs. To escape from Filch’s office without punishment was\nprobably some kind of school record.\n“Harry! Harry! Did it work?”\nNearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him,\nHarry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that\nappeared to have been dropped from a great height.\n“I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch’s office,” said Nick\neagerly. “Thought it might distract him—”\n“Was that you?” said Harry gratefully. “Yeah, it worked, I didn’t even\nget detention. Thanks, Nick!”\nThey set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry\nnoticed, was still holding Sir Patrick’s rejection letter.\n“I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless\nHunt,” Harry said.\nNearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right\nthrough him. He wished he hadn’t; it was like stepping through an icy\nshower.\n“But there is something you could do for me,” said Nick excitedly.\n“Harry—would I be asking too much—but no, you wouldn’t want—”\n“What is it?” said Harry.\n“Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,” said\nNearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified.\n“Oh,” said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy\nabout this. “Right.”\n“I’m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends\nwill be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you\nwould attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too,\nof course—but I daresay you’d rather go to the school feast?” He watched\nHarry on tenterhooks.\n“No,” said Harry quickly, “I’ll come—”"

Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And”—he\nhesitated, looking excited—“do you think you could possibly mention to Sir\nPatrick how very frightening and impressive you find me?”\n“Of—of course,” said Harry.\nNearly Headless Nick beamed at him.\n“A deathday party?” said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at\nlast and joined her and Ron in the common room. “I bet there aren’t many\nliving people who can say they’ve been to one of those—it’ll be\nfascinating!”\n“Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?” said Ron,\nwho was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. “Sounds\ndead depressing to me…”\nRain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but\ninside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the\ncountless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing\nhomework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out\nwhat would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred\nhad “rescued” the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of\nMagical Creatures class and it was now smoldering gently on a table\nsurrounded by a knot of curious people.\nHarry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and\nthe Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air,\nemitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The\nsight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular\ndisplay of tangerine stars showering from the salamander’s mouth, and its\nescape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and\nthe Kwikspell envelope from Harry’s mind.\nBy the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise\nto go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating\ntheir Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live\nbats, Hagrid’s vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for\nthree men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a\ntroupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.\n“A promise is a promise,” Hermione reminded Harry bossily. “You\nsaid you’d go to the deathday party.”\nSo at seven o’clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past\nthe doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with\ngold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the\ndungeons.\nThe passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick’s party had been\nlined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were\nlong, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly\nlight even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every\nstep they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he\nheard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous\nblackboard.\n“Is that supposed to be music?” Ron whispered.

They turned a corner\nand saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black\nvelvet drapes.\n“My dear friends,” he said mournfully. “Welcome, welcome… so\npleased you could come…”\nHe swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.\nIt was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-\nwhite, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor,\nwaltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by\nan orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead\nblazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose\nin a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.\n“Shall we have a look around?” Harry suggested, wanting to warm up\nhis feet.\n“Careful not to walk through anyone,” said Ron nervously, and they\nset off around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy\nnuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff\nghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his\nforehead. Harry wasn’t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt,\nstaring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a\nwide berth by the other ghosts.\n“Oh, no,” said Hermione, stopping abruptly. “Turn back, turn back, I\ndon’t want to talk to Moaning Myrtle—”\n“Who?” said Harry as they backtracked quickly.\n“She haunts one of the toilets in the girls’ bathroom on the first floor,”\nsaid Hermione.\n“She haunts a toilet?”\n“Yes. It’s been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums\nand flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it’s\nawful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you—”\n“Look, food!” said Ron.\nOn the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in\nblack velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in\ntheir tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish\nwere laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were\nheaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese\ncovered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake\nin the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words,\nSIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON\nDIED 31ST OCTOBER, 1492\nHarry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table,\ncrouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed\nthrough one of the stinking salmon.\n“Can you taste it if you walk through it?” Harry asked him.\n“Almost,” said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.\n“I expect they’ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,” said Hermione\nknowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid\nhaggis.\n“Can we move?

He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a\nrevolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.\n“Nibbles?” he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in\nfungus.\n“No thanks,” said Hermione.\n“Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,” said Peeves, his eyes dancing.\n“Rude you was about poor Myrtle.” He took a deep breath and bellowed,\n“OY! MYRTLE!”\n“Oh, no, Peeves, don’t tell her what I said, she’ll be really upset,”\nHermione whispered frantically. “I didn’t mean it, I don’t mind her—er,\nhello, Myrtle.”\nThe squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face\nHarry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly\nspectacles.\n“What?” she said sulkily.\n“How are you, Myrtle?” said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. “It’s\nnice to see you out of the toilet.”\nMyrtle sniffed.\n“Miss Granger was just talking about you—” said Peeves slyly in\nMyrtle’s ear.\n“Just saying—saying—how nice you look tonight,” said Hermione,\nglaring at Peeves.\nMyrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.\n“You’re making fun of me,” she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her\nsmall, see-through eyes.\n“No—honestly—didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s looking?” said\nHermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.\n“Oh, yeah—”\n“She did—”\n“Don’t lie to me,” Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face,\nwhile Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. “D’you think I don’t\nknow what people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle!\nMiserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!”\n“You’ve forgotten pimply,” Peeves hissed in her ear.\nMoaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon.\nPeeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, “Pimply!\nPimply!”\n“Oh, dear,” said Hermione sadly.\nNearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd.\n“Enjoying yourselves?”\n“Oh, yes,” they lied.\n“Not a bad turnout,” said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. “The Wailing\nWidow came all the way up from Kent… It’s nearly time for my speech, I’d\nbetter go and warn the orchestra…”\nThe orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They,\nand everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement,\nas a hunting horn sounded.\n“Oh, here we go,” said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly."

The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too,\nbut stopped quickly at the sight of Nick’s face.\nThe horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted,\nrearing and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held\nhis bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the\nhorn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see\nover the crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless\nNick, squashing his head back onto his neck.\n“Nick!” he roared. “How are you? Head still hanging in there?”\nHe gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the\nshoulder.\n“Welcome, Patrick,” said Nick stiffly.\n“Live ’uns!” said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and\ngiving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the\ncrowd howled with laughter).\n“Very amusing,” said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.\n“Don’t mind Nick!” shouted Sir Patrick’s head from the floor. “Still\nupset we won’t let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say—look at the fellow\n—”\n“I think,” said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick,\n“Nick’s very—frightening and—er—”\n“Ha!” yelled Sir Patrick’s head. “Bet he asked you to say that!”\n“If I could have everyone’s attention, it’s time for my speech!” said\nNearly Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into\nan icy blue spotlight.\n“My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great\nsorrow…”\nBut nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless\nHunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to\nwatch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but\ngave up as Sir Patrick’s head went sailing past him to loud cheers.\nHarry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.\n“I can’t stand much more of this,” Ron muttered, his teeth chattering,\nas the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the\ndance floor.\n“Let’s go,” Harry agreed.\nThey backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who\nlooked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway\nfull of black candles.\n“Pudding might not be finished yet,” said Ron hopefully, leading the\nway toward the steps to the entrance hall.\nAnd then Harry heard it.\n“…rip… tear… kill…”\nIt was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in\nLockhart’s office.\nHe stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his\nmight, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.\n“Harry, what’re you—?”\n“It’s that voice again—shut up a minute—”\n“…soo hungry… for so long…”"

Harry was sure it was moving away—\nmoving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared\nat the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to\nwhom stone ceilings didn’t matter?\n“This way,” he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the\nentrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of\ntalk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry\nsprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione\nclattering behind him.\n“Harry, what’re we—”\n“SHH!”\nHarry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing\nfainter still, he heard the voice: “…I smell blood… I SMELL BLOOD!”\nHis stomach lurched—\n“It’s going to kill someone!” he shouted, and ignoring Ron’s and\nHermione’s bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a\ntime, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps—\nHarry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione\npanting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last,\ndeserted passage.\n“Harry, what was that all about?” said Ron, wiping sweat off his face.\n“I couldn’t hear anything…”\nBut Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.\n“Look!”\nSomething was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly,\nsquinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the\nwall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming\ntorches.\nTHE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN\nOPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.\n“What’s that thing—hanging underneath?” said Ron, a slight quiver in\nhis voice.\nAs they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped—there was a large puddle\nof water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched\ntoward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of\nthem realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash.\nMrs. Norris, the caretaker’s cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch\nbracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.\nFor a few seconds, they didn’t move. Then Ron said, “Let’s get out of\nhere.”\n“Shouldn’t we try and help—” Harry began awkwardly.\n“Trust me,” said Ron. “We don’t want to be found here.”\nBut it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them\nthat the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they\nstood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud,\nhappy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the\npassage from both ends.\nThe chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front"

In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and\ndetached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.\n“Come with me, Argus,” he said to Filch. “You, too, Mr. Potter, Mr.\nWeasley, Miss Granger.”\nLockhart stepped forward eagerly.\n“My office is nearest, Headmaster—just upstairs—please feel free—”\n“Thank you, Gilderoy,” said Dumbledore.\nThe silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and\nimportant, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and\nSnape.\nAs they entered Lockhart’s darkened office there was a flurry of\nmovement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the\npictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit the\ncandles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore laid Mrs. Norris on the\npolished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione\nexchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight,\nwatching.\nThe tip of Dumbledore’s long, crooked nose was barely an inch from\nMrs. Norris’s fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon\nspectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor\nMcGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape loomed\nbehind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as\nthough he was trying hard not to smile. And Lockhart was hovering around\nall of them, making suggestions.\n“It was definitely a curse that killed her—probably the Transmogrifian\nTorture—I’ve seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn’t there, I know\nthe very countercurse that would have saved her…”\nLockhart’s comments were punctuated by Filch’s dry, racking sobs.

        "text": "Lockhart’s comments were punctuated by Filch’s dry, racking sobs. He\nwas slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face\nin his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn’t help feeling a bit\nsorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself. If\nDumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled for sure.\nDumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and\ntapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: She continued to\nlook as though she had been recently stuffed.\n“…I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,”\nsaid Lockhart, “a series of attacks, the full story’s in my autobiography, I\nwas able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which cleared the\nmatter up at once…”\nThe photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in\nagreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair net.\nAt last Dumbledore straightened up.\n“She’s not dead, Argus,” he said softly.\nLockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of\nmurders he had prevented.\n“Not dead?” choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris.\n“But why’s she all—all stiff and frozen?”\n“She has been Petrified,” said Dumbledore (“Ah! I thought so!” said\nLockhart). “But how, I cannot say…”\n“Ask him!” shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to\nHarry.\n“No second year could have done this,” said Dumbledore firmly. “It\nwould take Dark Magic of the most advanced—”\n“He did it, he did it!” Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. “You saw\nwhat he wrote on the wall! He found—in my office—he knows I’m a—I’m\na—” Filch’s face worked horribly. “He knows I’m a Squib!” he finished.\n“I never touched Mrs. Norris!” Harry said loudly, uncomfortably\naware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls.\n“And I don’t even know what a Squib is.”\n“Rubbish!” snarled Filch. “He saw my Kwikspell letter!”\n“If I might speak, Headmaster,” said Snape from the shadows, and\nHarry’s sense of foreboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had to\nsay was going to do him any good.\n“Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the\nwrong time,” he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted\nit. “But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was he in\nthe upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn’t he at the Halloween feast?”\nHarry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the\ndeathday party. “…there were hundreds of ghosts, they’ll tell you we were\nthere—”\n“But why not join the feast afterward?” said Snape, his black eyes\nglittering in the candlelight. “Why go up to that corridor?”\nRon and Hermione looked at Harry.\n“Because—because—” Harry said, his heart thumping very fast;\nsomething told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had\nbeen led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, “because we"

I personally feel he should be taken off\nthe Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest.”\n“Really, Severus,” said Professor McGonagall sharply, “I see no reason\nto stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn’t hit over the head with a\nbroomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything\nwrong.”\nDumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling light-\nblue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.\n“Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,” he said firmly.\nSnape looked furious. So did Filch.\n“My cat has been Petrified!” he shrieked, his eyes popping. “I want to\nsee some punishment!”\n“We will be able to cure her, Argus,” said Dumbledore patiently.\n“Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon\nas they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will\nrevive Mrs. Norris.”\n“I’ll make it,” Lockhart butted in. “I must have done it a hundred\ntimes. I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep—”\n“Excuse me,” said Snape icily. “But I believe I am the Potions master\nat this school.”\nThere was a very awkward pause.\n“You may go,” Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\nThey went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When\nthey were a floor up from Lockhart’s office, they turned into an empty\nclassroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry squinted at his\nfriends’ darkened faces.\n“D’you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?”\n“No,” said Ron, without hesitation. “Hearing voices no one else can\nhear isn’t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.”\nSomething in Ron’s voice made Harry ask, “You do believe me, don’t\nyou?”\n“’Course I do,” said Ron quickly. “But—you must admit it’s weird…”\n“I know it’s weird,” said Harry. “The whole thing’s weird. What was\nthat writing on the wall about? ‘The Chamber Has Been Opened’…What’s\nthat supposed to mean?”\n“You know, it rings a sort of bell,” said Ron slowly. “I think someone\ntold me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once… might’ve been\nBill…”\n“And what on earth’s a Squib?” said Harry.\nTo his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.\n“Well—it’s not funny really—but as it’s Filch,” he said. “A Squib is"

        "text": "Bill…”\n“And what on earth’s a Squib?” said Harry.\nTo his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.\n“Well—it’s not funny really—but as it’s Filch,” he said. “A Squib is\nsomeone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn’t got any magic\npowers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite\nunusual. If Filch’s trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon\nhe must be a Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates students so\nmuch.” Ron gave a satisfied smile. “He’s bitter.”\nA clock chimed somewhere.\n“Midnight,” said Harry. “We’d better get to bed before Snape comes\nalong and tries to frame us for something else.”\n* * *\nFor a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on\nMrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone’s minds by pacing the spot\nwhere she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come\nback. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs.\nSkower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words\nstill gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn’t guarding\nthe scene of the crime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors,\nlunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for\nthings like “breathing loudly” and “looking happy.”\nGinny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris’s fate.\nAccording to Ron, she was a great cat lover.\n“But you haven’t really got to know Mrs. Norris,” Ron told her\nbracingly. “Honestly, we’re much better off without her.” Ginny’s lip\ntrembled. “Stuff like this doesn’t often happen at Hogwarts,” Ron assured\nher. “They’ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no\ntime. I just hope he’s got time to Petrify Filch before he’s expelled. I’m only\njoking—” Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.\nThe attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for\nHermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing almost\nnothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when\nthey asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did\nthey find out.\nHarry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay\nbehind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he went\nupstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-Fletchley, the\nHufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming toward him. Harry had just opened\nhis mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and\nsped off in the opposite direction.\nHarry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of\nMagic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a three-foot-long\ncomposition on “The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards.”\n“I don’t believe it, I’m still eight inches short…” said Ron furiously,\nletting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll. “And Hermione’s\ndone four feet seven inches and her writing’s tiny.”\n“Where is she?” asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling"

I think she’s trying to read the whole library\nbefore Christmas.”\nHarry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.\n“Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,” said Ron,\nscribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. “All that junk\nabout Lockhart being so great—”\nHermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable\nand at last seemed ready to talk to them.\n“All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,” she said,\nsitting down next to Harry and Ron. “And there’s a two-week waiting list. I\nwish I hadn’t left my copy at home, but I couldn’t fit it in my trunk with all\nthe Lockhart books.”\n“Why do you want it?” said Harry.\n“The same reason everyone else wants it,” said Hermione, “to read up\non the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.”\n“What’s that?” said Harry quickly.\n“That’s just it. I can’t remember,” said Hermione, biting her lip. “And I\ncan’t find the story anywhere else—”\n“Hermione, let me read your composition,” said Ron desperately,\nchecking his watch.\n“No, I won’t,” said Hermione, suddenly severe. “You’ve had ten days\nto finish it—”\n“I only need another two inches, come on—”\nThe bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic,\nbickering.\nHistory of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor\nBinns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting\nthing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through\nthe blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people said he hadn’t noticed\nhe was dead. He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body\nbehind him in an armchair in front of the staffroom fire; his routine had not\nvaried in the slightest since.\nToday was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and\nbegan to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly\neveryone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long\nenough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again. He had been\nspeaking for half an hour when something happened that had never\nhappened before. Hermione put up her hand.\nProfessor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on\nthe International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.\n“Miss—er—?”\n“Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything\nabout the Chamber of Secrets,” said Hermione in a clear voice.\nDean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open,\ngazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown’s head\ncame up off her arms and Neville Longbottom’s elbow slipped off his desk.\nProfessor Binns blinked."

        "text": "gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown’s head\ncame up off her arms and Neville Longbottom’s elbow slipped off his desk.\nProfessor Binns blinked.\n“My subject is History of Magic,” he said in his dry, wheezy voice. “I\ndeal with, facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.” He cleared his\nthroat with a small noise like chalk snapping and continued, “In September\nof that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers—”\nHe stuttered to a halt. Hermione’s hand was waving in the air again.\n“Miss Grant?”\n“Please, sir, don’t legends always have a basis in fact?”\nProfessor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was sure\nno student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead.\n“Well,” said Professor Binns slowly, “yes, one could argue that, I\nsuppose.” He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student\nproperly before. “However, the legend of which you speak is such a very\nsensational, even ludicrous tale—”\nBut the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns’s every\nword. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry could tell\nhe was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.\n“Oh, very well,” he said slowly. “Let me see… the Chamber of\nSecrets…\n“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand\nyears ago—the precise date is uncertain—by the four greatest witches and\nwizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric\nGryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.\nThey built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an\nage when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards\nsuffered much persecution.”\nHe paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.\n“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking\nout youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle\nto be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift\nbegan to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be\nmore selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that\nmagical learning should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked\ntaking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy.\nAfter a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between\nSlytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school.”\nProfessor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled\nold tortoise.\n“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he said. “But these\nhonest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of\nSecrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the\ncastle, of which the other founders knew nothing.\n“Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so\nthat none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the\nschool. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets,\nunleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were\nunworthy to study magic.”"

The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets,\nunleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were\nunworthy to study magic.”\nThere was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn’t the\nusual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns’s classes. There was unease\nin the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for more. Professor\nBinns looked faintly annoyed.\n“The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,” he said. “Naturally,\nthe school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many times,\nby the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A tale told to\nfrighten the gullible.”\nHermione’s hand was back in the air.\n“Sir—what exactly do you mean by the ‘horror within’ the Chamber?”\n“That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of\nSlytherin alone can control,” said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy voice.\nThe class exchanged nervous looks.\n“I tell you, the thing does not exist,” said Professor Binns, shuffling his\nnotes. “There is no Chamber and no monster.”\n“But, sir,” said Seamus Finnigan, “if the Chamber can only be opened\nby Slytherin’s true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they?”\n“Nonsense, O’Flaherty,” said Professor Binns in an aggravated tone.\n“If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses haven’t\nfound the thing—”\n“But, Professor,” piped up Parvati Patil, “you’d probably have to use\nDark Magic to open it—”\n“Just because a wizard doesn’t use Dark Magic doesn’t mean he can’t,\nMiss Pennyfeather,” snapped Professor Binns. “I repeat, if the likes of\nDumbledore—”\n“But maybe you’ve got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore\ncouldn’t—” began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough.\n“That will do,” he said sharply. “It is a myth! It does not exist! There is\nnot a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom\ncupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We will return, if you\nplease, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable fact!”\nAnd within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.\n“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” Ron told\nHarry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors\nat the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I never\nknew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn’t be in his House if you\npaid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I’d’ve\ngot the train straight back home…”\nHermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say anything. His\nstomach had just dropped unpleasantly.\nHarry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had\nseriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could remember, as\nthough it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when\nhe’d placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great, you know,"

They stopped and looked.\nThe scene was just as it had been that night, except that there was no stiff\ncat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood against the\nwall bearing the message “The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened.”\n“That’s where Filch has been keeping guard,” Ron muttered.\nThey looked at each other. The corridor was deserted.\n“Can’t hurt to have a poke around,” said Harry, dropping his bag and\ngetting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching for\nclues.\n“Scorch marks!” he said. “Here—and here—”\n“Come and look at this!” said Hermione. “This is funny…”\nHarry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the\nwall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty\nspiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack. A\nlong, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though they had all climbed\nit in their hurry to get outside.\n“Have you ever seen spiders act like that?” said Hermione\nwonderingly.\n“No,” said Harry, “have you, Ron? Ron?”\nHe looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed\nto be fighting the impulse to run.\n“What’s up?” said Harry.\n“I—don’t—like—spiders,” said Ron tensely.\n“I never knew that,” said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise.\n“You’ve used spiders in Potions loads of times…”\n“I don’t mind them dead,” said Ron, who was carefully looking"

Hermione was obviously still trying not to\nlaugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said, “Remember\nall that water on the floor? Where did that come from? Someone’s mopped\nit up.”\n“It was about here,” said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces\npast Filch’s chair and pointing. “Level with this door.”\nHe reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as\nthough he’d been burned.\n“What’s the matter?” said Harry.\n“Can’t go in there,” said Ron gruffly. “That’s a girls’ toilet.”\n“Oh, Ron, there won’t be anyone in there,” said Hermione, standing up\nand coming over. “That’s Moaning Myrtle’s place. Come on, let’s have a\nlook.”\nAnd ignoring the large OUT OF ORDER sign, she opened the door.\nIt was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set\nfoot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of chipped\nsinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs\nof a few candles, burning low in their holders; the wooden doors to the\nstalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its\nhinges.\nHermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall.\nWhen she reached it she said, “Hello, Myrtle, how are you?”\nHarry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the\ntank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.\n“This is a girls’ bathroom,” she said, eyeing Ron and Harry\nsuspiciously. “They’re not girls.”\n“No,” Hermione agreed. “I just wanted to show them how—er—nice it\nis in here.”\nShe waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.\n“Ask her if she saw anything,” Harry mouthed at Hermione.\n“What are you whispering?” said Myrtle, staring at him.\n“Nothing,” said Harry quickly. “We wanted to ask—”\n“I wish people would stop talking behind my back!” said Myrtle, in a\nvoice choked with tears. “I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead\n—”\n“Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,” said Hermione. “Harry only—”\n“No one wants to upset me! That’s a good one!” howled Myrtle. “My\nlife was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along\nruining my death!”\n“We wanted to ask you if you’ve seen anything funny lately,” said\nHermione quickly. “Because a cat was attacked right outside your front\ndoor on Halloween.”"

Coming back here while everyone’s at dinner—”\n“Why shouldn’t we be here?” said Ron hotly, stopping short and\nglaring at Percy. “Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!”\n“That’s what I told Ginny,” said Percy fiercely, “but she still seems to\nthink you’re going to be expelled, I’ve never seen her so upset, crying her\neyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly\noverexcited by this business—”\n“You don’t care about Ginny,” said Ron, whose ears were now\nreddening. “You’re just worried I’m going to mess up your chances of being\nHead Boy—”\n“Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect\nbadge. “And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or I’ll\nwrite to Mum!”\nAnd he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron’s ears.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in\nthe common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept\nblotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to\nremove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as\nhis homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut.\nTo Harry’s surprise, Hermione followed suit.\n“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as though\ncontinuing a conversation they had just been having. “Who’d want to\nfrighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?”"

Hermione looked back, unconvinced.\n“If you’re talking about Malfoy—”\n“Of course I am!” said Ron. “You heard him—‘You’ll be next,\nMudbloods!’—come on, you’ve only got to look at his foul rat face to know\nit’s him—”\n“Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?” said Hermione skeptically.\n“Look at his family,” said Harry, closing his books, too. “The whole lot\nof them have been in Slytherin; he’s always boasting about it. They could\neasily be Slytherin’s descendants. His father’s definitely evil enough.”\n“They could’ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!”\nsaid Ron. “Handing it down, father to son…”\n“Well,” said Hermione cautiously, “I suppose it’s possible…”\n“But how do we prove it?” said Harry darkly.\n“There might be a way,” said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice\nstill further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. “Of course, it\nwould be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We’d be breaking about\nfifty school rules, I expect—”\n“If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know,\nwon’t you?” said Ron irritably.\n“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to do is to get\ninside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without\nhim realizing it’s us.”\n“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.\n“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some\nPolyjuice Potion.”\n“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.\n“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago—”\n“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to\nSnape?” muttered Ron.\n“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could\nchange into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy\nwould probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting about it in the\nSlytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.”\n“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, frowning.\n“What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?”\n“It wears off after a while,” said Hermione, waving her hand\nimpatiently. “But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. Snape said\nit was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it’s bound to be in the\nRestricted Section of the library.”\nThere was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section:\nYou needed a signed note of permission from a teacher.\n“Hard to see why we’d want the book, really,” said Ron, “if we\nweren’t going to try and make one of the potions.”\n“I think,” said Hermione, “that if we made it sound as though we were\njust interested in the theory, we might stand a chance…”"

Instead, he read passages from his books to\nthem, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits. He usually\npicked Harry to help him with these reconstructions; so far, Harry had been\nforced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of\na Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been\nunable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.\nHarry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next\nDefense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf. If he\nhadn’t had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he\nwould have refused to do it.\n“Nice loud howl, Harry—exactly—and then, if you’ll believe it, I\npounced—like this—slammed him to the floor—thus—with one hand, I\nmanaged to hold him down—with my other, I put my wand to his throat—I\nthen screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely\ncomplex Homorphus Charm—he let out a piteous moan—go on, Harry—\nhigher than that—good—the fur vanished—the fangs shrank—and he\nturned back into a man. Simple, yet effective—and another village will\nremember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly\nterror of werewolf attacks.”\nThe bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.\n“Homework—compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga\nWerewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!”\nThe class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room,\nwhere Ron and Hermione were waiting.\n“Ready?” Harry muttered.\n“Wait till everyone’s gone,” said Hermione nervously. “All right…”\nShe approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in\nher hand, Harry and Ron right behind her.\n“Er—Professor Lockhart?” Hermione stammered. “I wanted to—to get\nthis book out of the library. Just for background reading.” She held out the\npiece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. “But the thing is, it’s in the\nRestricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it—I’m sure\nit would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about\nslow-acting venoms—”\n“Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!” said Lockhart, taking the note from\nHermione and smiling widely at her. “Possibly my very favorite book. You\nenjoyed it?”\n“Oh, yes,” said Hermione eagerly. “So clever, the way you trapped that\nlast one with the tea-strainer—”\n“Well, I’m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year\na little extra help,” said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an enormous"

        "text": "last one with the tea-strainer—”\n“Well, I’m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year\na little extra help,” said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an enormous\npeacock quill. “Yes, nice, isn’t it?” he said, misreading the revolted look on\nRon’s face. “I usually save it for book signings.”\nHe scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it\nback to Hermione.\n“So, Harry,” said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with\nfumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. “Tomorrow’s the first\nQuidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it\nnot? I hear you’re a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was asked to try for\nthe National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of\nthe Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the need for a little private training,\ndon’t hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able\nplayers…”\nHarry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after\nRon and Hermione.\n“I don’t believe it,” he said as the three of them examined the signature\non the note. “He didn’t even look at the book we wanted.”\n“That’s because he’s a brainless git,” said Ron. “But who cares, we’ve\ngot what we needed—”\n“He is not a brainless git,” said Hermione shrilly as they half ran\ntoward the library.\n“Just because he said you were the best student of the year—”\nThey dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the\nlibrary. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who looked\nlike an underfed vulture.\n“Moste Potente Potions?” she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the\nnote from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn’t let go.\n“I was wondering if I could keep it,” she said breathlessly.\n“Oh, come on,” said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it\nat Madam Pince. “We’ll get you another autograph. Lockhart’ll sign\nanything if it stands still long enough.”\nMadam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to\ndetect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away between the lofty\nshelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and moldy-\nlooking book. Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left, trying\nnot to walk too quickly or look too guilty.\nFive minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle’s out-of-\norder bathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron’s objections by\npointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go,\nso they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily\nin her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she them.\nHermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of\nthem bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance why it\nbelonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had effects almost\ntoo gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant\nillustrations, which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside"

Some of the potions had effects almost\ntoo gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant\nillustrations, which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside\nout and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.\n“Here it is,” said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The\nPolyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through\ntransforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had\nimagined the looks of intense pain on their faces.\n“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said Hermione as\nthey scanned the recipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,”\nshe murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. “Well,\nthey’re easy enough, they’re in the student store-cupboard, we can help\nourselves… Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn—don’t know where\nwe’re going to get that—shredded skin of a boomslang—that’ll be tricky,\ntoo—and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.”\n“Excuse me?” said Ron sharply. “What d’you mean, a bit of whoever\nwe’re changing into? I’m drinking nothing with Crabbe’s toenails in it—”\nHermione continued as though she hadn’t heard him.\n“We don’t have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those\nbits last…”\nRon turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry.\n“D’you realize how much we’re going to have to steal, Hermione?\nShredded skin of a boomslang, that’s definitely not in the students’\ncupboard. What’re we going to do, break into Snape’s private stores? I\ndon’t know if this is a good idea…”\nHermione shut the book with a snap.\n“Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,” she said. There were\nbright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual. “I\ndon’t want to break rules, you know. I think threatening Muggle-borns is far\nworse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don’t want to find out if\nit’s Malfoy, I’ll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in\n—”\n“I never thought I’d see the day when you’d be persuading us to break\nrules,” said Ron. “All right, we’ll do it. But not toenails, okay?”\n“How long will it take to make, anyway?” said Harry as Hermione,\nlooking happier, opened the book again.\n“Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the\nlacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days… I’d say it’d be ready\nin about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.”\n“A month?” said Ron. “Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle-\nborns in the school by then!” But Hermione’s eyes narrowed dangerously\nagain, and he added swiftly, “But it’s the best plan we’ve got, so full steam\nahead, I say.”\nHowever, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for\nthem to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, “It’ll be a lot less\nhassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.”"

He was nervous, mainly at the thought\nof what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a\nteam mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy. He had never\nwanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After half an hour of lying there with his\ninsides churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early,\nwhere he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty\ntable, all looking uptight and not speaking much.\nAs eleven o’clock approached, the whole school started to make its\nway down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hint\nof thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry\ngood luck as he entered the locker rooms. The team pulled on their scarlet\nGryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood’s usual pre-match pep\ntalk.\n“Slytherin has better brooms than us,” he began. “No point denying it.\nBut we’ve got better people on our brooms. We’ve trained harder than they\nhave, we’ve been flying in all weathers—” (“Too true,” muttered George\nWeasley. “I haven’t been properly dry since August”) “—and we’re going\nto make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his\nway onto their team.”\nChest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.\n“It’ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have\nsomething more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die\ntrying, Harry, because we’ve got to win today, we’ve got to.”\n“So no pressure, Harry,” said Fred, winking at him.\nAs they walked out onto the field, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly\ncheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin\nbeaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard,\ntoo. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake\nhands, which they did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping\nrather harder than was necessary.\n“On my whistle,” said Madam Hooch. “Three… two… one…”\nWith a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen players\nrose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting\naround for the Snitch.\n“All right there, Scarhead?” yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him as\nthough to show off the speed of his broom.\nHarry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black\nBludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it\nruffle his hair as it passed.\n“Close one, Harry!” said George, streaking past him with his club in\nhis hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin.

Harry saw\nGeorge give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey,\nbut the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry\nagain.\nHarry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard\ntoward Malfoy. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot\nat Harry’s head.\nHarry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the\nfield. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. What was\ngoing on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it was their\njob to try and unseat as many people as possible…\nFred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Harry\nducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger was\nknocked off course.\n“Gotcha!” Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was\nmagnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once more and\nHarry was forced to fly off at full speed.\nIt had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face,\nsplattering onto his glasses. He didn’t have a clue what was going on in the\nrest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say,\n“Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero—”\nThe Slytherins’ superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and\nmeanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of\nthe air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that\nHarry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance\nto look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.\n“Someone’s—tampered—with—this—Bludger—” Fred grunted,\nswinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on\nHarry.\n“We need time out,” said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop the\nBludger breaking Harry’s nose at the same time.\nWood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch’s whistle rang\nout and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid\nthe mad Bludger.\n“What’s going on?” said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled\ntogether, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. “We’re being flattened. Fred,\nGeorge, where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring?”\n“We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from\nmurdering Harry, Oliver,” said George angrily. “Someone’s fixed it—it\nwon’t leave Harry alone. It hasn’t gone for anyone else all game. The\nSlytherins must have done something to it.”\n“But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch’s office since\nour last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then…” said\nWood, anxiously.\nMadam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Harry\ncould see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction."

Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with\nthe rogue one.”\n“Don’t be thick,” said Fred. “It’ll take your head off.”\nWood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys.\n“Oliver, this is insane,” said Alicia Spinnet angrily. “You can’t let\nHarry deal with that thing on his own. Let’s ask for an inquiry—”\n“If we stop now, we’ll have to forfeit the match!” said Harry. “And\nwe’re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come on,\nOliver, tell them to leave me alone!”\n“This is all your fault,” George said angrily to Wood. “‘Get the Snitch\nor die trying,’ what a stupid thing to tell him—”\nMadam Hooch had joined them.\n“Ready to resume play?” she asked Wood.\nWood looked at the determined look on Harry’s face.\n“All right,” he said. “Fred, George, you heard Harry—leave him alone\nand let him deal with the Bludger on his own.”\nThe rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch’s whistle,\nHarry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger\nbehind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and swooped,\nspiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes\nwide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung\nupside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger. He could hear\nlaughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue\nBludger was heavy and couldn’t change direction as quickly as Harry\ncould; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the\nstadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal\nposts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood—\nA whistling in Harry’s ear told him the Bludger had just missed him\nagain; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.\n“Training for the ballet, Potter?” yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to\ndo a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the\nBludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in\nhatred, he saw it—the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches above\nMalfoy’s left ear—and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn’t seen it.\nFor an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed\ntoward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.\nWHAM.\nHe had stayed still a second too long.

His\narm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as\nthough from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He focused\non the Snitch clutched in his good hand.\n“Aha,” he said vaguely. “We’ve won.”\nAnd he fainted.\nHe came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with\nsomeone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth.\n“Oh, no, not you,” he moaned.\n“Doesn’t know what he’s saying,” said Lockhart loudly to the anxious\ncrowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. “Not to worry, Harry. I’m\nabout to fix your arm.”\n“No!” said Harry. “I’ll keep it like this, thanks…”\nHe tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar\nclicking noise nearby.\n“I don’t want a photo of this, Colin,” he said loudly.\n“Lie back, Harry,” said Lockhart soothingly. “It’s a simple charm I’ve\nused countless times—”\n“Why can’t I just go to the hospital wing?” said Harry through\nclenched teeth.\n“He should really, Professor,” said a muddy Wood, who couldn’t help\ngrinning even though his Seeker was injured. “Great capture, Harry, really\nspectacular, your best yet, I’d say—”\nThrough the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and\nGeorge Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still putting\nup a terrific fight.\n“Stand back,” said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green\nsleeves.\n“No—don’t—” said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand\nand a second later had directed it straight at Harry’s arm.\nA strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry’s shoulder and\nspread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was being\ndeflated. He didn’t dare look at what was happening. He had shut his eyes,\nhis face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears were realized as the\npeople above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly.\nHis arm didn’t hurt anymore—nor did it feel remotely like an arm."

That’s the thing to bear in mind.\nSo, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing—ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss\nGranger, would you escort him?—and Madam Pomfrey will be able to—er\n—tidy you up a bit.”\nAs Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep\nbreath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him pass\nout again.\nPoking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh-\ncolored rubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened.\nLockhart hadn’t mended Harry’s bones. He had removed them.\nMadam Pomfrey wasn’t at all pleased.\n“You should have come straight to me!” she raged, holding up the sad,\nlimp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm. “I\ncan mend bones in a second—but growing them back—”\n“You will be able to, won’t you?” said Harry desperately.\n“I’ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,” said Madam Pomfrey\ngrimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. “You’ll have to stay the night…”\nHermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry’s bed while\nRon helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery,\nboneless arm into a sleeve.\n“How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?” Ron called\nthrough the curtain as he pulled Harry’s limp fingers through the cuff. “If\nHarry had wanted deboning he would have asked.”\n“Anyone can make a mistake,” said Hermione. “And it doesn’t hurt\nanymore, does it, Harry?”\n“No,” said Harry, getting into bed. “But it doesn’t do anything else\neither.”\nAs he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly.\nHermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. Madam\nPomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro.\n“You’re in for a rough night,” she said, pouring out a steaming\nbeakerful and handing it to him. “Regrowing bones is a nasty business.”\nSo was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry’s mouth and throat as it\nwent down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about\ndangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving\nRon and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water.\n“We won, though,” said Ron, a grin breaking across his face. “That\nwas some catch you made. Malfoy’s face… he looked ready to kill…”\n“I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,” said Hermione darkly.\n“We can add that to the list of questions we’ll ask him when we’ve\ntaken the Polyjuice Potion,” said Harry, sinking back onto his pillows. “I\nhope it tastes better than this stuff…”"

You’ve got to be joking,” said Ron.\nThe door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy and\nsoaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry.\n“Unbelievable flying, Harry,” said George. “I’ve just seen Marcus Flint\nyelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch on top of his head\nand not noticing. Malfoy didn’t seem too happy.”\nThey had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they\ngathered around Harry’s bed and were just getting started on what promised\nto be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over, shouting,\n“This boy needs rest, he’s got thirty-three bones to regrow! Out! OUT!”\nAnd Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the\nstabbing pains in his limp arm.\nHours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch\nblackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of large\nsplinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken him. Then,\nwith a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was sponging his forehead\nin the dark.\n“Get off!” he said loudly, and then, “Dobby!”\nThe house-elf’s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry\nthrough the darkness. A single tear was running down his long, pointed\nnose.\n“Harry Potter came back to school,” he whispered miserably. “Dobby\nwarned and warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn’t you heed Dobby? Why\ndidn’t Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train?”\nHarry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby’s sponge\naway.\n“What’re you doing here?” he said. “And how did you know I missed\nthe train?”\nDobby’s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion.\n“It was you!” he said slowly. “You stopped the barrier from letting us\nthrough!”\n“Indeed yes, sir,” said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears\nflapping. “Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway\nand Dobby had to iron his hands afterward”—he showed Harry ten long,\nbandaged fingers—“but Dobby didn’t care, sir, for he thought Harry Potter\nwas safe, and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school\nanother way!”\nHe was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.\n“Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at\nHogwarts, he let his master’s dinner burn! Such a flogging Dobby never\nhad, sir…”\nHarry slumped back onto his pillows.\n“You nearly got Ron and me expelled,” he said fiercely. “You’d better\nget lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.”\nDobby smiled weakly.\n“Dobby is used to death threats, sir.

Dobby gets them five times a day\nat home.”\nHe blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking\nso pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself.\n“Why d’you wear that thing, Dobby?” he asked curiously.\n“This, sir?” said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. “’Tis a mark of the\nhouse-elf’s enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if his masters present\nhim with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby even a sock,\nsir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever.”\nDobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, “Harry Potter must\ngo home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make—”\n“Your Bludger?” said Harry, anger rising once more. “What d’you\nmean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?”\n“Not kill you, sir, never kill you!” said Dobby, shocked. “Dobby wants\nto save Harry Potter’s life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than\nremain here, sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent\nhome!”\n“Oh, is that all?” said Harry angrily. “I don’t suppose you’re going to\ntell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?”\n“Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!” Dobby groaned, more tears dripping\nonto his ragged pillowcase. “If he knew what he means to us, to the lowly,\nthe enslaved, we dregs of the magical world! Dobby remembers how it was\nwhen He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the height of his powers, sir!\nWe house-elves were treated like vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still\ntreated like that, sir,” he admitted, drying his face on the pillowcase. “But\nmostly, sir, life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-\nWho-Must-Not-Be-Named. Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord’s\npower was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like\na beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never\nend, sir… And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps\nhappening already, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that\nhistory is to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once\nmore—”\nDobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry’s water jug from his\nbedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A\nsecond later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, “Bad\nDobby, very bad Dobby…”\n“So there is a Chamber of Secrets?” Harry whispered. “And—did you\nsay it’s been opened before? Tell me, Dobby!”\nHe seized the elf’s bony wrist as Dobby’s hand inched toward the\nwater jug. “But I’m not Muggle-born—how can I be in danger from the\nChamber?”\n“Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,” stammered the elf,"

Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, ’tis too dangerous—”\n“Who is it, Dobby?” Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby’s wrist\nto stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again. “Who’s opened\nit? Who opened it last time?”\n“Dobby can’t, sir, Dobby can’t, Dobby mustn’t tell!” squealed the elf.\n“Go home, Harry Potter, go home!”\n“I’m not going anywhere!” said Harry fiercely. “One of my best\nfriends is Muggle-born; she’ll be first in line if the Chamber really has been\nopened—”\n“Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!” moaned Dobby in a\nkind of miserable ecstasy. “So noble! So valiant! But he must save himself,\nhe must, Harry Potter must not—”\nDobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too.\nThere were footsteps coming down the passageway outside.\n“Dobby must go!” breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack,\nand Harry’s fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back into\nbed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew\nnearer.\nNext moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a\nlong woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end of\nwhat looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a second later,\ncarrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed.\n“Get Madam Pomfrey,” whispered Dumbledore, and Professor\nMcGonagall hurried past the end of Harry’s bed out of sight. Harry lay\nquite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then\nProfessor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by Madam\nPomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress. He heard a\nsharp intake of breath.\n“What happened?” Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore,\nbending over the statue on the bed.\n“Another attack,” said Dumbledore. “Minerva found him on the\nstairs.”\n“There was a bunch of grapes next to him,” said Professor\nMcGonagall. “We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter.”\nHarry’s stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised\nhimself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A ray of\nmoonlight lay across its staring face.\nIt was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up\nin front of him, holding his camera.\n“Petrified?” whispered Madam Pomfrey.\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “But I shudder to think… If Albus\nhadn’t been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate—who knows what\nmight have—”\nThe three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned\nforward and wrenched the camera out of Colin’s rigid grip."

Then Dumbledore leaned\nforward and wrenched the camera out of Colin’s rigid grip.\n“You don’t think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?” said\nProfessor McGonagall eagerly.\nDumbledore didn’t answer. He opened the back of the camera.\n“Good gracious!” said Madam Pomfrey.\nA jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds away,\ncaught the acrid smell of burnt plastic.\n“Melted,” said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. “All melted…”\n“What does this mean, Albus?” Professor McGonagall asked urgently.\n“It means,” said Dumbledore, “that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed\nopen again.”\nMadam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor McGonagall\nstared at Dumbledore.\n“But, Albus… surely… who?”\n“The question is not who,” said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin. “The\nquestion is, how…”\nAnd from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall’s shadowy\nface, she didn’t understand this any better than he did.\nC\nHAPTER 11\nT D C\nHE UELING LUB\nHarry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with\nwinter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and\nlooked over at Colin’s bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high\ncurtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he was awake,\nMadam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began\nbending and stretching his arm and fingers.\n“All in order,” she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge left-\nhanded. “When you’ve finished eating, you may leave.”\nHarry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor\nTower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they\nweren’t there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have\ngot to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren’t interested in whether he\nhad his bones back or not.\nAs Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it, looking\nin far better spirits than last time they’d met.\n“Oh, hello, Harry,” he said. “Excellent flying yesterday, really\nexcellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup—you earned\nfifty points!”\n“You haven’t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?” said Harry.\n“No, I haven’t,” said Percy, his smile fading. “I hope Ron’s not in\nanother girls’ toilet…”\nHarry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then\nheaded straight for Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. He couldn’t see why Ron\nand Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure that neither\nFilch nor any prefects were around, he opened the door and heard their\nvoices coming from a locked stall.\n“It’s me,” he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a\nsplash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione’s eye peering\nthrough the keyhole.\n“Harry!” she said. “You gave us such a fright—come in—how’s your\narm?”"

An old cauldron was\nperched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they\nhad lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires was a\nspeciality of Hermione’s.\n“We’d’ve come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the\nPolyjuice Potion,” Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the stall\nagain. “We’ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.”\nHarry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.\n“We already know—we heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor\nFlitwick this morning. That’s why we decided we’d better get going—”\n“The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,” snarled\nRon. “D’you know what I think? He was in such a foul temper after the\nQuidditch match, he took it out on Colin.”\n“There’s something else,” said Harry, watching Hermione tearing\nbundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. “Dobby came to\nvisit me in the middle of the night.”\nRon and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them everything\nDobby had told him—or hadn’t told him. Hermione and Ron listened with\ntheir mouths open.\n“The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?” Hermione said.\n“This settles it,” said Ron in a triumphant voice. “Lucius Malfoy\nmust’ve opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he’s told\ndear old Draco how to do it. It’s obvious. Wish Dobby’d told you what kind\nof monster’s in there, though. I want to know how come nobody’s noticed it\nsneaking around the school.”\n“Maybe it can make itself invisible,” said Hermione, prodding leeches\nto the bottom of the cauldron. “Or maybe it can disguise itself—pretend to\nbe a suit of armor or something—I’ve read about Chameleon Ghouls—”\n“You read too much, Hermione,” said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on\ntop of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at\nHarry.\n“So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your\narm…” He shook his head. “You know what, Harry? If he doesn’t stop\ntrying to save your life he’s going to kill you.”\n* * *\nThe news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as\nthough dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by\nMonday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion.\nThe first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as\nthough scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone.\nGinny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was\ndistraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way\nabout cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur\nor boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped\nwhen Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs.\nWeasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares."

They only stopped\nwhen Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs.\nWeasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.\nMeanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans,\namulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school. Neville\nLongbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple\ncrystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out\nthat he was in no danger; he was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be\nattacked.\n“They went for Filch first,” Neville said, his round face fearful. “And\neveryone knows I’m almost a Squib.”\nIn the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around\nas usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for\nChristmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that\nMalfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays\nwould be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a\nconfession out of him.\nUnfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still needed the\nbicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to\nget them was from Snape’s private stores. Harry privately felt he’d rather\nface Slytherin’s legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his\noffice.\n“What we need,” said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon’s\ndouble Potions lesson loomed nearer, “is a diversion. Then one of us can\nsneak into Snape’s office and take what we need.”\nHarry and Ron looked at her nervously.\n“I think I’d better do the actual stealing,” Hermione continued in a\nmatter-of-fact tone. “You two will be expelled if you get into any more\ntrouble, and I’ve got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough\nmayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.”\nHarry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape’s Potions\nclass was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.\nPotions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday\nafternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood\nsteaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars\nof ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks\nabout the Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively.\nDraco Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish\neyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get\ndetention faster than you could say “Unfair.”\nHarry’s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on\nmore important things. He was waiting for Hermione’s signal, and he hardly\nlistened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion. When Snape turned\nand walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry’s eye and nodded.\nHarry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred’s\nFilibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his\nwand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only\nseconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it"

Knowing he had only\nseconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it\nlanded right on target in Goyle’s cauldron.\nGoyle’s potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked\nas splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his\nnose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over\nhis eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate—Snape was\ntrying to restore calm and find out what had happened. Through the\nconfusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape’s office.\n“Silence! SILENCE!” Snape roared. “Anyone who has been splashed,\ncome here for a Deflating Draught—when I find out who did this—”\nHarry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head\ndrooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class\nlumbered up to Snape’s desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs,\nothers unable to talk through gigantic puffed-up lips, Harry saw Hermione\nslide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging.\nWhen everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings\nhad subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle’s cauldron and scooped out the\ntwisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.\n“If I ever find out who threw this,” Snape whispered, “I shall make\nsure that person is expelled.”\nHarry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression.\nSnape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later\ncould not have been more welcome.\n“He knew it was me,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried\nback to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. “I could tell.”\nHermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir\nfeverishly.\n“It’ll be ready in two weeks,” she said happily.\n“Snape can’t prove it was you,” said Ron reassuringly to Harry. “What\ncan he do?”\n“Knowing Snape, something foul,” said Harry as the potion frothed\nand bubbled.\nA week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the\nentrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the\nnotice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up.\nSeamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over, looking excited.\n“They’re starting a Dueling Club!” said Seamus. “First meeting\ntonight! I wouldn’t mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of\nthese days…”\n“What, you reckon Slytherin’s monster can duel?” said Ron, but he,\ntoo, read the sign with interest.\n“Could be useful,” he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into\ndinner. “Shall we go?”\nHarry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o’clock that evening\nthey hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables had vanished\nand a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles\nfloating overhead. The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the\nschool seemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking\nexcited."

Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent!\n“Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this\nlittle dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend\nyourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions—for full details,\nsee my published works.\n“Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,” said Lockhart,\nflashing a wide smile. “He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling\nhimself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration\nbefore we begin. Now, I don’t want any of you youngsters to worry—you’ll\nstill have your Potions master when I’m through with him, never fear!”\n“Wouldn’t it be good if they finished each other off?” Ron muttered in\nHarry’s ear.\nSnape’s upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart was still\nsmiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he’d have been running\nas fast as he could in the opposite direction.\nLockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least,\nLockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his\nhead irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them.\n“As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative\nposition,” Lockhart told the silent crowd. “On the count of three, we will\ncast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.”\n“I wouldn’t bet on that,” Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his\nteeth.\n“One—two—three—”\nBoth of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at\ntheir opponent; Snape cried: “Expelliarmus!” There was a dazzling flash of\nscarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the\nstage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor.\nMalfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was\ndancing on tiptoes. “Do you think he’s all right?” she squealed through her\nfingers.\n“Who cares?” said Harry and Ron together.\nLockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and\nhis wavy hair was standing on end.\n“Well, there you have it!” he said, tottering back onto the platform.\n“That was a Disarming Charm—as you see, I’ve lost my wand—ah, thank\nyou, Miss Brown—yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor\nSnape, but if you don’t mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you"

Lockhart\nteamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry and\nRon first.\n“Time to split up the dream team, I think,” he sneered. “Weasley, you\ncan partner Finnigan. Potter—”\nHarry moved automatically toward Hermione.\n“I don’t think so,” said Snape, smiling coldly. “Mr. Malfoy, come over\nhere. Let’s see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, Miss Granger\n—you can partner Miss Bulstrode.”\nMalfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl\nwho reminded Harry of a picture he’d seen in Holidays with Hags. She was\nlarge and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her\na weak smile that she did not return.\n“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the platform. “And\nbow!”\nHarry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off\neach other.\n“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I count to three, cast\nyour charms to disarm your opponents—only to disarm them—we don’t\nwant any accidents—one… two… three—”\nHarry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on “two”:\nHis spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit over the head\nwith a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working,\nand wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and\nshouted, “Rictusempra!”\nA jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up,\nwheezing.\n“I said disarm only!” Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the\nbattling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a\nTickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung back,\nwith a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was\non the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his\nwand at Harry’s knees, choked, “Tarantallegra!” and the next second\nHarry’s legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep.\n“Stop! Stop!” screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge.\n“Finite Incantatem!” he shouted; Harry’s feet stopped dancing, Malfoy\nstopped laughing, and they were able to look up.\nA haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene.

We’ll be sending what’s left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital\nwing in a matchbox.” Neville’s round, pink face went pinker. “How about\nMalfoy and Potter?” said Snape with a twisted smile.\n“Excellent idea!” said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the\nmiddle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room.\n“Now, Harry,” said Lockhart. “When Draco points his wand at you,\nyou do this.”\nHe raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling\naction, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up,\nsaying, “Whoops—my wand is a little overexcited—”\nSnape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something\nin his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and\nsaid, “Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?”\n“Scared?” muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn’t hear him.\n“You wish,” said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.\nLockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. “Just do what I did,\nHarry!”\n“What, drop my wand?”\nBut Lockhart wasn’t listening.\n“Three—two—one—go!” he shouted.\nMalfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, “Serpensortia!”\nThe end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long black\nsnake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised\nitself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly\naway, clearing the floor.\n“Don’t move, Potter,” said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of\nHarry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. “I’ll get rid of\nit…”\n“Allow me!” shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake\nand there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into\nthe air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, hissing\nfuriously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself"

Enraged, hissing\nfuriously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself\nagain, fangs exposed, poised to strike.\nHarry wasn’t sure what made him do it. He wasn’t even aware of\ndeciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward\nas though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake,\n“Leave him alone!” And miraculously—inexplicably—the snake slumped\nto the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry.\nHarry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the snake wouldn’t attack\nanyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn’t have explained.\nHe looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking\nrelieved, or puzzled, or even grateful—but certainly not angry and scared.\n“What do you think you’re playing at?” he shouted, and before Harry\ncould say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.\nSnape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a\nsmall puff of black smoke. Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an\nunexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry didn’t like\nit. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls.\nThen he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.\n“Come on,” said Ron’s voice in his ear. “Move—come on—”\nRon steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. As\nthey went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though\nthey were frightened of catching something. Harry didn’t have a clue what\nwas going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they\nhad dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room.\nThen Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and said, “You’re a Parselmouth.\nWhy didn’t you tell us?”\n“I’m a what?” said Harry.\n“A Parselmouth!” said Ron. “You can talk to snakes!”\n“I know,” said Harry. “I mean, that’s only the second time I’ve ever\ndone it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo\nonce—long story—but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort\nof set it free without meaning to—that was before I knew I was a wizard—”\n“A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?” Ron repeated\nfaintly.\n“So?” said Harry. “I bet loads of people here can do it.”\n“Oh, no they can’t,” said Ron. “It’s not a very common gift. Harry, this\nis bad.”\n“What’s bad?” said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. “What’s wrong\nwith everyone? Listen, if I hadn’t told that snake not to attack Justin—”\n“Oh, that’s what you said to it?”\n“What d’you mean? You were there—you heard me—”\n“I heard you speaking Parseltongue,” said Ron. “Snake language. You\ncould have been saying anything—no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded\nlike you were egging the snake on or something—it was creepy, you know\n—”\nHarry gaped at him."

But—I didn’t realize—how can I speak\na language without knowing I can speak it?”\nRon shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though\nsomeone had died. Harry couldn’t see what was so terrible.\n“D’you want to tell me what’s wrong with stopping a massive snake\nbiting off Justin’s head?” he said. “What does it matter how I did it as long\nas Justin doesn’t have to join the Headless Hunt?”\n“It matters,” said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice,\n“because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was\nfamous for. That’s why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.”\nHarry’s mouth fell open.\n“Exactly,” said Ron. “And now the whole school’s going to think\nyou’re his great-great-great-great-grandson or something—”\n“But I’m not,” said Harry, with a panic he couldn’t quite explain.\n“You’ll find that hard to prove,” said Hermione. “He lived about a\nthousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.”\n* * *\nHarry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtains\naround his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower\nwindow and wondered…\nCould he be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin? He didn’t know\nanything about his father’s family, after all. The Dursleys had always\nforbidden questions about his wizarding relatives.\nQuietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The words\nwouldn’t come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to do it.\nBut I’m in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn’t have\nput me in here if I had Slytherin blood…\nAh, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to\nput you in Slytherin, don’t you remember?\nHarry turned over. He’d see Justin the next day in Herbology and he’d\nexplain that he’d been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he\nthought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.\nBy next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had\nturned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was\ncanceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the\nMandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it\nwas so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris\nand Colin Creevey.\nHarry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common\nroom, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard\nchess.\n“For heaven’s sake, Harry,” said Hermione, exasperated, as one of\nRon’s bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the\nboard. “Go and find Justin if it’s so important to you.”\nSo Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where\nJustin might be.\nThe castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the"

Shivering, Harry walked past\nclassrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of what was\nhappening within. Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who, by\nthe sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger. Resisting the urge to\ntake a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using his free\ntime to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first.\nA group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in Herbology were\nindeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn’t seem to be working.\nBetween the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see that their\nheads were close together and they were having what looked like an\nabsorbing conversation. He couldn’t see whether Justin was among them.\nHe was walking toward them when something of what they were saying\nmet his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section.\n“So anyway,” a stout boy was saying, “I told Justin to hide up in our\ndormitory. I mean to say, if Potter’s marked him down as his next victim,\nit’s best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin’s been\nwaiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he\nwas Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he’d been down for Eton. That’s\nnot the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin’s heir on the loose, is\nit?”\n“You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?” said a girl with blonde\npigtails anxiously.\n“Hannah,” said the stout boy solemnly, “he’s a Parselmouth. Everyone\nknows that’s the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent\none who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-\ntongue.”\nThere was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on,\n“Remember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir, Beware.\nPotter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Filch’s cat’s\nattacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying Potter at the Quidditch\nmatch, taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud. Next thing we\nknow—Creevey’s been attacked.”\n“He always seems so nice, though,” said Hannah uncertainly, “and,\nwell, he’s the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can’t be all\nbad, can he?”\nErnie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and\nHarry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie’s words.\n“No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I\nmean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should have been\nblasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have\nsurvived a curse like that.” He dropped his voice until it was barely more\nthan a whisper, and said, “That’s probably why You-Know-Who wanted to"

Didn’t want another Dark Lord competing with\nhim. I wonder what other powers Potter’s been hiding?”\nHarry couldn’t take anymore. Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out\nfrom behind the bookshelves. If he hadn’t been feeling so angry, he would\nhave found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the Hufflepuffs\nlooked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him, and the color\nwas draining out of Ernie’s face.\n“Hello,” said Harry. “I’m looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley.”\nThe Hufflepuffs’ worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They all\nlooked fearfully at Ernie.\n“What do you want with him?” said Ernie in a quavering voice.\n“I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the\nDueling Club,” said Harry.\nErnie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, “We were\nall there. We saw what happened.”\n“Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?” said\nHarry.\n“All I saw,” said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he\nspoke, “was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward\nJustin.”\n“I didn’t chase it at him!” Harry said, his voice shaking with anger. “It\ndidn’t even touch him!”\n“It was a very near miss,” said Ernie. “And in case you’re getting\nideas,” he added hastily, “I might tell you that you can trace my family back\nthrough nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood’s as pure as\nanyone’s, so—”\n“I don’t care what sort of blood you’ve got!” said Harry fiercely. “Why\nwould I want to attack Muggle-borns?”\n“I’ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,” said Ernie swiftly.\n“It’s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,” said\nHarry. “I’d like to see you try it.”\nHe turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself a\nreproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing the gilded cover of\na large spellbook.\nHarry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going,\nhe was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into something very\nlarge and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor.\n“Oh, hello, Hagrid,” Harry said, looking up.\nHagrid’s face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered\nbalaclava, but it couldn’t possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of the\ncorridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging from one of\nhis massive, gloved hands.\n“All righ’, Harry?” he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could speak.\n“Why aren’t yeh in class?”\n“Canceled,” said Harry, getting up. “What’re you doing in here?”\nHagrid held up the limp rooster.\n“Second one killed this term,” he explained. “It’s either foxes or a"

Yeh look all hot an’ bothered—”\nHarry couldn’t bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the\nHufflepuffs had been saying about him.\n“It’s nothing,” he said. “I’d better get going, Hagrid, it’s\nTransfiguration next and I’ve got to pick up my books.”\nHe walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him.\n“Justin’s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he\nlet slip to Potter he was Muggle-born…”\nHarry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor, which\nwas particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy\ndraft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. He was halfway down\nthe passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor.\nHe turned to squint at what he’d fallen over and felt as though his\nstomach had dissolved.\nJustin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of\nshock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And that\nwasn’t all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight Harry had\never seen.\nIt was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent,\nbut black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the\nfloor. His head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock\nidentical to Justin’s.\nHarry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a\nkind of drumroll against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down the\ndeserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could\naway from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers\nfrom the classes on either side.\nHe could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But he\ncouldn’t just leave them lying here… He had to get help… Would anyone\nbelieve he hadn’t had anything to do with this?\nAs he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a\nbang. Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out.\n“Why, it’s potty wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, knocking Harry’s glasses\naskew as he bounced past him. “What’s Potter up to? Why’s Potter lurking\n—”\nPeeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down,\nhe spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the right way up,\nfilled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed, “ATTACK!\nATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE!\nRUN FOR YOUR LIVES!

        "text": "RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! ATTAAAACK!”\nCrash—crash—crash—door after door flew open along the corridor\nand people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene of such\nconfusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept\nstanding in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself pinned against the\nwall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came running,\nfollowed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-white-striped\nhair. She used her wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and\nordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared\nsomewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.\n“Caught in the act!” Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his\nfinger dramatically at Harry.\n“That will do, Macmillan!” said Professor McGonagall sharply.\nPeeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the\nscene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin and\nNearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:\n“Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,\nYou’re killing off students, you think it’s good fun—”\n“That’s enough, Peeves!” barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves\nzoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry.\nJustin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and\nProfessor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to\nknow what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, Professor\nMcGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to Ernie\nwith instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This Ernie did,\nfanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This left Harry and\nProfessor McGonagall alone together.\n“This way, Potter,” she said.\n“Professor,” said Harry at once, “I swear I didn’t—”\n“This is out of my hands, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall curtly.\nThey marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a\nlarge and extremely ugly stone gargoyle.\n“Lemon drop!” she said. This was evidently a password, because the\ngargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him\nsplit in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry couldn’t fail to\nbe amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving\nsmoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor McGonagall\nstepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them. They rose\nupward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a\ngleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.\nHe knew now where he was being taken. This must be where\nDumbledore lived.\nC\nHAPTER 12\nT P P\nHE OLYJUICE OTION\nThey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor\nMcGonagall rapped on the door.

One thing was certain: of all the teachers’ offices\nHarry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore’s was by far the most\ninteresting. If he hadn’t been scared out of his wits that he was about to be\nthrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to\nlook around it.\nIt was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A\nnumber of curious silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables,\nwhirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with\nportraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing\ngently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and,\nsitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard’s hat—the Sorting Hat.\nHarry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and\nwizards on the walls. Surely it couldn’t hurt if he took the hat down and\ntried it on again? Just to see… just to make sure it had put him in the right\nHouse—\nHe walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and\nlowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped down\nover his eyes, just as it had done the last time he’d put it on. Harry stared at\nthe black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice said in his ear, “Bee\nin your bonnet, Harry Potter?”\n“Er, yes,” Harry muttered. “Er—sorry to bother you—I wanted to ask\n—”\n“You’ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,” said\nthe hat smartly. “Yes… you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand\nby what I said before”—Harry’s heart leapt—“you would have done well in\nSlytherin—”\nHarry’s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and\npulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harry pushed it\nback onto its shelf, feeling sick.\n“You’re wrong,” he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn’t move.\nHarry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind him\nmade him wheel around.\nHe wasn’t alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door\nwas a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry\nstared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise\nagain. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as Harry\nwatched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.\nHarry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore’s pet\nbird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into\nflames.\nHarry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked\nfeverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn’t\nsee one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek\nand next second there was nothing but a smoldering pile of ash on the floor.\nThe office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.\n“Professor,” Harry gasped. “Your bird—I couldn’t do anything—he\njust caught fire—”"

Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.\n“Professor,” Harry gasped. “Your bird—I couldn’t do anything—he\njust caught fire—”\nTo Harry’s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.\n“About time, too,” he said. “He’s been looking dreadful for days; I’ve\nbeen telling him to get a move on.”\nHe chuckled at the stunned look on Harry’s face.\n“Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is\ntime for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him…”\nHarry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke\nits head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.\n“It’s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,” said Dumbledore,\nseating himself behind his desk. “He’s really very handsome most of the\ntime, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.\nThey can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and\nthey make highly faithful pets.”\nIn the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was\nthere for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled himself in the\nhigh chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue\nstare.\nBefore Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of\nthe office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look\nin his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the\ndead rooster still swinging from his hand.\n“It wasn’ Harry, Professor Dumbledore!” said Hagrid urgently. “I was\ntalkin’ ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir—”\nDumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on,\nwaving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere.\n“—it can’t’ve bin him, I’ll swear it in front o’ the Ministry o’ Magic if\nI have to—”\n“Hagrid, I—”\n“—yeh’ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never—”\n“Hagrid!” said Dumbledore loudly. “I do not think that Harry attacked\nthose people.”\n“Oh,” said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. “Right. I’ll\nwait outside then, Headmaster.”\nAnd he stomped out looking embarrassed.\n“You don’t think it was me, Professor?” Harry repeated hopefully as\nDumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.\n“No, Harry, I don’t,” said Dumbledore, though his face was somber\nagain. “But I still want to talk to you.”\nHarry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of\nhis long fingers together.\n“I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you’d like to tell\nme,” he said gently. “Anything at all.”\nHarry didn’t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting,\n“You’ll be next, Mudbloods!” and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away\nin Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice\nhe had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: “Hearing voices no\none else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.” He\nthought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing"

Curiously, it was Nearly Headless\nNick’s fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that\nto a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm\nsomeone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book\nseats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for\nChristmas.\n“At this rate, we’ll be the only ones left,” Ron told Harry and\nHermione. “Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it’s going\nto be.”\nCrabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed\nup to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were\nleaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as\nthough he were about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the\nmuttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.\nFred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of\ntheir way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, “Make\nway for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through…”\nPercy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.\n“It is not a laughing matter,” he said coldly.\n“Oh, get out of the way, Percy,” said Fred. “Harry’s in a hurry.”\n“Yeah, he’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his\nfanged servant,” said George, chortling.\nGinny didn’t find it amusing either.\n“Oh, don’t,” she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he\nwas planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off\nwith a large clove of garlic when they met.\nHarry didn’t mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at\nleast, thought the idea of his being Slytherin’s heir was quite ludicrous. But\ntheir antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked\nincreasingly sour each time he saw them at it.\n“It’s because he’s bursting to say it’s really him,” said Ron knowingly.\n“You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you’re\ngetting all the credit for his dirty work.”\n“Not for long,” said Hermione in a satisfied tone. “The Polyjuice\nPotion’s nearly ready. We’ll be getting the truth out of him any day now.”\nAt last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds\ndescended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and\nenjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of\nGryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly\nwithout bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private.

Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their\nchildish behavior, didn’t spend much time in the Gryffindor common room.\nHe had already told them pompously that he was only staying over\nChristmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during\nthis troubled time.\nChristmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only\nones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst\nin, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.\n“Wake up,” she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.\n“Hermione—you’re not supposed to be in here—” said Ron, shielding\nhis eyes against the light.\n“Merry Christmas to you, too,” said Hermione, throwing him his\npresent. “I’ve been up for nearly an hour, adding more lace-wings to the\npotion. It’s ready.”\nHarry sat up, suddenly wide awake.\n“Are you sure?”\n“Positive,” said Hermione, shirting Scabbers the rat so that she could\nsit down on the end of Ron’s four-poster. “If we’re going to do it, I say it\nshould be tonight.”\nAt that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small\npackage in her beak.\n“Hello,” said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. “Are you\nspeaking to me again?”\nShe nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far\nbetter present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be\nfrom the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him\nto find out whether he’d be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer\nvacation, too.\nThe rest of Harry’s Christmas presents were far more satisfactory.\nHagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle toffee, which Harry decided to\nsoften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying\nwith the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch\nteam, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry\nopened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs.\nWeasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt,\nthinking about Mr. Weasley’s car (which hadn’t been seen since its crash\nwith the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron\nwere planning next.\nNo one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later,\ncould fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.\nThe Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-\ncovered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe\ncrisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry,\nfrom the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols,\nHagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he\nconsumed. Percy, who hadn’t noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect\nbadge so that it now read “Pin-head,” kept asking them all what they were\nsniggering at.

Harry didn’t even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud,\nsnide remarks about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of\nluck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours’ time.\nHarry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas\npudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans\nfor the evening.\n“We still need a bit of the people you’re changing into,” said Hermione\nmatter-of-factly, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for\nlaundry detergent. “And obviously, it’ll be best if you can get something of\nCrabbe’s and Goyle’s; they’re Malfoy’s best friends, he’ll tell them\nanything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can’t\nburst in on us while we’re interrogating him.\n“I’ve got it all worked out,” she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry’s\nand Ron’s stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes. “I’ve\nfilled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make sure\nCrabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they are, they’re bound\nto eat them. Once they’re asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them\nin a broom closet.”\nHarry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.\n“Hermione, I don’t think—”\n“That could go seriously wrong—”\nBut Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor\nMcGonagall sometimes had.\n“The potion will be useless without Crabbe’s and Goyle’s hair,” she\nsaid sternly. “You do want to investigate Malfoy, don’t you?”\n“Oh, all right, all right,” said Harry. “But what about you? Whose hair\nare you ripping out?”\n“I’ve already got mine!” said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle\nout of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. “Remember\nMillicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on\nmy robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she’s gone home for\nChristmas—so I’ll just have to tell the Slytherins I’ve decided to come\nback.”\nWhen Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion\nagain, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.\n“Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go\nwrong?”\nBut to Harry’s and Ron’s utter amazement, stage one of the operation\nwent just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted\nentrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had\nremained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of\ntrifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters.\nWhen they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry\nand Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.\n“How thick can you get?” Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe\ngleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them.

Grinning\nstupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a\nmoment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces.\nThen, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over\nbackward onto the floor.\nBy far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall.\nOnce they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked\nout a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle’s forehead and Ron pulled\nout several of Crabbe’s hairs. They also stole their shoes, because their own\nwere far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at\nwhat they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.\nThey could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall\nin which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over\ntheir faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.\n“Hermione?”\nThey heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny-faced\nand looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the\nbubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet\nseat.\n“Did you get them?” Hermione asked breathlessly.\nHarry showed her Goyle’s hair.\n“Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,” Hermione\nsaid, holding up a small sack. “You’ll need bigger sizes once you’re Crabbe\nand Goyle.”\nThe three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked\nlike thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.\n“I’m sure I’ve done everything right,” said Hermione, nervously\nrereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. “It looks like the\nbook says it should… once we’ve drunk it, we’ll have exactly an hour\nbefore we change back into ourselves.”\n“Now what?” Ron whispered.\n“We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.”\nHermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses.\nThen, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode’s hair out of its\nbottle into the first glass.\nThe potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A\nsecond later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.\n“Urgh—essence of Millicent Bulstrode,” said Ron, eyeing it with\nloathing. “Bet it tastes disgusting.”\n“Add yours, then,” said Hermione.\nHarry dropped Goyle’s hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe’s\ninto the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle’s turned the khaki\ncolor of a booger, Crabbe’s a dark, murky brown.\n“Hang on,” said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses.\n“We’d better not all drink them in here… Once we turn into Crabbe and\nGoyle we won’t fit. And Millicent Bulstrode’s no pixie.”\n“Good thinking,” said Ron, unlocking the door. “We’ll take separate\nstalls.”\nCareful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into\nthe middle stall.\n“Ready?” he called."

It\ntasted like overcooked cabbage.\nImmediately, his insides started writhing as though he’d just\nswallowed live snakes—doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to\nbe sick—then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the\nvery ends of his fingers and toes—next, bringing him gasping to all fours,\ncame a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like\nhot wax—and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers\nthickened, the nails broadened, the knuckles were bulging like bolts—his\nshoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that\nhair was creeping down toward his eyebrows—his robes ripped as his chest\nexpanded like a barrel bursting its hoops—his feet were agony in shoes four\nsizes too small—\nAs suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown\non the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end\ntoilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was\nwhat it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old\nrobes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare\nones, and laced up Goyle’s boatlike shoes. He reached up to brush his hair\nout of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his\nforehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because\nGoyle obviously didn’t need them—he took them off and called, “Are you\ntwo okay?” Goyle’s low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth.\n“Yeah,” came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.\nHarry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror.\nGoyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratched his ear.\nSo did Goyle.\nRon’s door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked\npale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the\npudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.\n“This is unbelievable,” said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding\nCrabbe’s flat nose. “Unbelievable.”\n“We’d better get going,” said Harry, loosening the watch that was\ncutting into Goyle’s thick wrist. “We’ve still got to find out where the\nSlytherin common room is. I only hope we can find someone to follow…”\nRon, who had been gazing at Harry, said, “You don’t know how\nbizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.” He banged on Hermione’s door.\n“C’mon, we need to go—”\nA high-pitched voice answered him.\n“I—I don’t think I’m going to come after all. You go on without me.”\n“Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode’s ugly, no one’s going to\nknow it’s you—”\n“No—really—I don’t think I’ll come. You two hurry up, you’re"

You two hurry up, you’re\nwasting time—”\nHarry looked at Ron, bewildered.\n“That looks more like Goyle,” said Ron. “That’s how he looks every\ntime a teacher asks him a question.”\n“Hermione, are you okay?” said Harry through the door.\n“Fine—I’m fine—go on—”\nHarry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had\nalready passed.\n“We’ll meet you back here, all right?” he said.\nHarry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked\nthat the coast was clear, and set off.\n“Don’t swing your arms like that,” Harry muttered to Ron.\n“Eh?”\n“Crabbe holds them sort of stiff…”\n“How’s this?”\n“Yeah, that’s better…”\nThey went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was a\nSlytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there\nwas nobody around.\n“Any ideas?” muttered Harry.\n“The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,” said\nRon, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely left his\nmouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance.\n“Excuse me,” said Ron, hurrying up to her. “We’ve forgotten the way\nto our common room.”\n“I beg your pardon?” said the girl stiffly. “Our common room? I’m a\nRavenclaw.”\nShe walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.\nHarry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their\nfootsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe’s and Goyle’s huge feet hit\nthe floor, feeling that this wasn’t going to be as easy as they had hoped.\nThe labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and\ndeeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how\nmuch time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when they were\ngetting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.\n“Ha!” said Ron excitedly. “There’s one of them now!”\nThe figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer,\nhowever, their hearts sank. It wasn’t a Slytherin, it was Percy.\n“What’re you doing down here?” said Ron in surprise.\nPercy looked affronted.\n“That,” he said stiffly, “is none of your business. It’s Crabbe, isn’t it?”\n“Wh—oh, yeah,” said Ron.\n“Well, get off to your dormitories,” said Percy sternly. “It’s not safe to\ngo wandering around dark corridors these days.”\n“You are,” Ron pointed out.\n“I,” said Percy, drawing himself up, “am a prefect. Nothing’s about to\nattack me.”\nA voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was\nstrolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was pleased to\nsee him.\n“There you are,” he drawled, looking at them. “Have you two been\npigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I’ve been looking for you; I want\nto show you something really funny.”\nMalfoy glanced witheringly at Percy."

I’ve been looking for you; I want\nto show you something really funny.”\nMalfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.\n“And what’re you doing down here, Weasley?” he sneered.\nPercy looked outraged.\n“You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!” he said. “I\ndon’t like your attitude!”\nMalfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry\nalmost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time.\nHe and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the next\npassage, “That Peter Weasley—”\n“Percy,” Ron corrected him automatically.\n“Whatever,” said Malfoy. “I’ve noticed him sneaking around a lot\nlately. And I bet I know what he’s up to. He thinks he’s going to catch\nSlytherin’s heir single-handed.”\nHe gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited\nlooks.\nMalfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.\n“What’s the new password again?” he said to Harry.\n“Er—” said Harry.\n“Oh, yeah—pure-blood!” said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door\nconcealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and Harry and\nRon followed him.\nThe Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with\nrough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were\nhanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved\nmantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around\nit in high-backed chairs.\n“Wait here,” said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair\nof empty chairs set back from the fire. “I’ll go and get it—my father’s just\nsent it to me—”\nWondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron sat\ndown, doing their best to look at home.\nMalfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a\nnewspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron’s nose.\n“That’ll give you a laugh,” he said.\nHarry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly,\ngave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry.\nIt had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said:\nINQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\nArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office,\nwas today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.\nMr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft\nand Wizardry, where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called\ntoday for Mr. Weasley’s resignation.\n“Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,” Mr. Malfoy\ntold our reporter. “He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his\nridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.”\nMr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told\nreporters to clear off or she’d set the family ghoul on them.\n“Well?” said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to\nhim. “Don’t you think it’s funny?”\n“Ha, ha,” said Harry bleakly."

He’ll be sacked if it doesn’t\nstop soon. Father’s always said old Dumbledore’s the worst thing that’s ever\nhappened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A decent headmaster would\nnever’ve let slime like that Creevey in.”\nMalfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a\ncruel but accurate impression of Colin: “‘Potter, can I have your picture,\nPotter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?’”\nHe dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.\n“What’s the matter with you two?”\nFar too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy\nseemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the\nuptake.\n“Saint Potter, the Mudbloods’ friend,” said Malfoy slowly. “He’s\nanother one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn’t go around with\nthat jumped-up Granger Mudblood. And people think he’s Slytherin’s heir!”\nHarry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds\naway from telling them it was him—but then—\n“I wish I knew who it is,” said Malfoy petulantly. “I could help them.”\nRon’s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than\nusual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn’t notice, and Harry, thinking fast, said,\n“You must have some idea who’s behind it all…”\n“You know I haven’t, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?”\nsnapped Malfoy. “And Father won’t tell me anything about the last time the\nChamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was\nbefore his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept\nquiet and it’ll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one\nthing—last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I\nbet it’s a matter of time before one of them’s killed this time… I hope it’s\nGranger,” he said with relish.\nRon was clenching Crabbe’s gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a\nbit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look\nand said, “D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was\ncaught?”\n“Oh, yeah… whoever it was was expelled,” said Malfoy. “They’re"

He says the school\nneeds ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it. Of\ncourse, he’s got a lot on his plate at the moment. You know the Ministry of\nMagic raided our manor last week?”\nHarry tried to force Goyle’s dull face into a look of concern.\n“Yeah…” said Malfoy. “Luckily, they didn’t find much. Father’s got\nsome very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we’ve got our own secret\nchamber under the drawing-room floor—”\n“Ho!” said Ron.\nMalfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. Even his hair was\nturning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening—their hour was up, Ron\nwas turning back into himself, and from the look of horror he was suddenly\ngiving Harry, he must be, too.\nThey both jumped to their feet.\n“Medicine for my stomach,” Ron grunted, and without further ado\nthey sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves\nat the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that\nMalfoy hadn’t noticed anything. Harry could feel his feet slipping around in\nGoyle’s huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed\nup the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled\npounding coming from the closet where they’d locked Crabbe and Goyle.\nLeaving their shoes outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up\nthe marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.\n“Well, it wasn’t a complete waste of time,” Ron panted, closing the\nbathroom door behind them. “I know we still haven’t found out who’s\ndoing the attacks, but I’m going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to\ncheck under the Malfoys’ drawing room.”\nHarry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was back to normal.\nHe put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione’s stall.\n“Hermione, come out, we’ve got loads to tell you—”\n“Go away!” Hermione squeaked.\nHarry and Ron looked at each other.\n“What’s the matter?” said Ron. “You must be back to normal by now,\nwe are—”\nBut Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry had\nnever seen her looking so happy.\n“Ooooooh, wait till you see,” she said. “It’s awful—”\nThey heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her\nrobes pulled up over her head.\n“What’s up?” said Ron uncertainly. “Have you still got Millicent’s\nnose or something?”\nHermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink."

There was\na flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school\narrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone\nthought that she had been attacked. So many students filed past the hospital\nwing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her\ncurtains again and placed them around Hermione’s bed, to spare her the\nshame of being seen with a furry face.\nHarry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term\nstarted, they brought her each day’s homework.\n“If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work,” said Ron,\ntipping a stack of books onto Hermione’s bedside table one evening.\n“Don’t be silly, Ron, I’ve got to keep up,” said Hermione briskly. Her\nspirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her\nface and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. “I don’t suppose\nyou’ve got any new leads?” she added in a whisper, so that Madam\nPomfrey couldn’t hear her.\n“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily.\n“I was so sure it was Malfoy,” said Ron, for about the hundredth time.\n“What’s that?” asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out\nfrom under Hermione’s pillow.\n“Just a get well card,” said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of\nsight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open, and\nread aloud:\n“To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your\nconcerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin,\nThird Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League,\nand five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award.”\nRon looked up at Hermione, disgusted.\n“You sleep with this under your pillow?”\nBut Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping\nover with her evening dose of medicine.\n“Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you’ve ever met, or what?” Ron said\nto Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward\nGryffindor Tower. Snape had given them so much homework, Harry"

Snape had given them so much homework, Harry\nthought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it. Ron was\njust saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails you were\nsupposed to add to a Hair-Raising Potion when an angry outburst from the\nfloor above reached their ears.\n“That’s Filch,” Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and\npaused, out of sight, listening hard.\n“You don’t think someone else’s been attacked?” said Ron tensely.\nThey stood still, their heads inclined toward Filch’s voice, which\nsounded quite hysterical.\n“—even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven’t got\nenough to do! No, this is the final straw, I’m going to Dumbledore—”\nHis footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a\ndistant door slam.\nThey poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly been\nmanning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot where\nMrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what Filch had been\nshouting about. A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it\nlooked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning\nMyrtle’s bathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear\nMyrtle’s wails echoing off the bathroom walls.\n“Now what’s up with her?” said Ron.\n“Let’s go and see,” said Harry, and holding their robes over their\nankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its\nOUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered.\nMoaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever\nbefore. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in the\nbathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of\nwater that had left both walls and floor soaking wet.\n“What’s up, Myrtle?” said Harry.\n“Who’s that?” glugged Myrtle miserably. “Come to throw something\nelse at me?”\nHarry waded across to her stall and said, “Why would I throw\nsomething at you?”\n“Don’t ask me,” Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more\nwater, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. “Here I am, minding\nmy own business, and someone thinks it’s funny to throw a book at me…”\n“But it can’t hurt you if someone throws something at you,” said\nHarry, reasonably. “I mean, it’d just go right through you, wouldn’t it?”\nHe had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked,\n“Let’s all throw books at Myrtle, because she can’t feel it! Ten points if you\ncan get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head!\nWell, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don’t think!”\n“Who threw it at you, anyway?” asked Harry.\n“I don’t know… I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death,\nand it fell right through the top of my head,” said Myrtle, glaring at them.\n“It’s over there, it got washed out…”"

        "text": "and it fell right through the top of my head,” said Myrtle, glaring at them.\n“It’s over there, it got washed out…”\nHarry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A\nsmall, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as\neverything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick it up, but\nRon suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.\n“What?” said Harry.\n“Are you crazy?” said Ron. “It could be dangerous.”\n“Dangerous?” said Harry, laughing. “Come off it, how could it be\ndangerous?”\n“You’d be surprised,” said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at\nthe book. “Some of the books the Ministry’s confiscated—Dad’s told me—\nthere was one that burned your eyes out. And everyone who read Sonnets of\na Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives. And some old witch\nin Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to\nwander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed.\nAnd—”\n“All right, I’ve got the point,” said Harry.\nThe little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy.\n“Well, we won’t find out unless we look at it,” he said, and he ducked\naround Ron and picked it up off the floor.\nHarry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover\ntold him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first page he\ncould just make out the name “T. M. Riddle” in smudged ink.\n“Hang on,” said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking\nover Harry’s shoulder. “I know that name… T. M. Riddle got an award for\nspecial services to the school fifty years ago.”\n“How on earth d’you know that?” said Harry in amazement.\n“Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in\ndetention,” said Ron resentfully. “That was the one I burped slugs all over.\nIf you’d wiped slime off a name for an hour, you’d remember it, too.”\nHarry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank. There\nwasn’t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel’s\nbirthday, or dentist, half-past three.\n“He never wrote in it,” said Harry, disappointed.\n“I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?” said Ron curiously.\nHarry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name\nof a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.\n“He must’ve been Muggle-born,” said Harry thoughtfully. “To have\nbought a diary from Vauxhall Road…”\n“Well, it’s not much use to you,” said Ron. He dropped his voice.\n“Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle’s nose.”\nHarry, however, pocketed it.\nHermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and fur-free,\nat the beginning of February. On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower,\nHarry showed her T. M. Riddle’s diary and told her the story of how they\nhad found it.\n“Oooh, it might have hidden powers,” said Hermione enthusiastically,"

Riddle’s diary and told her the story of how they\nhad found it.\n“Oooh, it might have hidden powers,” said Hermione enthusiastically,\ntaking the diary and looking at it closely.\n“If it has, it’s hiding them very well,” said Ron. “Maybe it’s shy. I\ndon’t know why you don’t chuck it, Harry.”\n“I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,” said Harry. “I\nwouldn’t mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to\nHogwarts either.”\n“Could’ve been anything,” said Ron. “Maybe he got thirty O.W.L.s or\nsaved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that\nwould’ve done everyone a favor…”\nBut Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione’s face that\nshe was thinking what he was thinking.\n“What?” said Ron, looking from one to the other.\n“Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn’t it?”\nhe said. “That’s what Malfoy said.”\n“Yeah…” said Ron slowly.\n“And this diary is fifty years old,” said Hermione, tapping it excitedly.\n“So?”\n“Oh, Ron, wake up,” snapped Hermione. “We know the person who\nopened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M.\nRiddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well,\nwhat if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? His\ndiary would probably tell us everything—where the Chamber is, and how to\nopen it, and what sort of creature lives in it—the person who’s behind the\nattacks this time wouldn’t want that lying around, would they?”\n“That’s a brilliant theory, Hermione,” said Ron, “with just one tiny\nlittle flaw. There’s nothing written in his diary.”\nBut Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.\n“It might be invisible ink!” she whispered.\nShe tapped the diary three times and said, “Aparecium!”\nNothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into\nher bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.\n“It’s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,” she said.\nShe rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.\n“I’m telling you, there’s nothing to find in there,” said Ron. “Riddle\njust got a diary for Christmas and couldn’t be bothered filling it in.”\nHarry couldn’t explain, even to himself, why he didn’t just throw\nRiddle’s diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary was\nblank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as\nthough it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was sure he had\nnever heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean\nsomething to him, almost as though Riddle was a friend he’d had when he\nwas very small, and had half-forgotten. But this was absurd. He’d never had\nfriends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.\nNevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so\nnext day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle’s\nspecial award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly\nunconvinced Ron, who told them he’d seen enough of the trophy room to"

It\ndidn’t carry details of why it had been given to him (“Good thing, too, or\nit’d be even bigger and I’d still be polishing it,” said Ron). However, they\ndid find Riddle’s name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of\nold Head Boys.\n“He sounds like Percy,” said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust.\n“Prefect, Head Boy… probably top of every class—”\n“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” said Hermione in a slightly hurt\nvoice.\nThe sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside the\ncastle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no more attacks\nsince those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was\npleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive,\nmeaning that they were fast leaving childhood.\n“The moment their acne clears up, they’ll be ready for repotting\nagain,” Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. “And after that,\nit won’t be long until we’re cutting them up and stewing them. You’ll have\nMrs. Norris back in no time.”\nPerhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry.\nIt must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with\nthe school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, whatever it was,\nwas even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years…\nErnie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn’t take this cheerful view. He was\nstill convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had “given himself\naway” at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn’t helping matters; he kept popping\nup in the crowded corridors singing “Oh, Potter, you rotter…” now with a\ndance routine to match.\nGilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks\nstop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the\nGryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration.\n“I don’t think there’ll be any more trouble, Minerva,” he said, tapping\nhis nose knowingly and winking. “I think the Chamber has been locked for\ngood this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time\nbefore I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard\non him.\n“You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash\naway the memories of last term! I won’t say any more just now, but I think I\nknow just the thing…”\nHe tapped his nose again and strode off.\nLockhart’s idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on\nFebruary fourteenth. Harry hadn’t had much sleep because of a late-running\nQuidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall,\nslightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he’d walked through the wrong\ndoors.\nThe walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse still,"

Worse still,\nheart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went\nover to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and\nHermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.\n“What’s going on?” Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping\nconfetti off his bacon.\nRon pointed to the teachers’ table, apparently too disgusted to speak.\nLockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving\nfor silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced.\nFrom where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor\nMcGonagall’s cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a\nlarge beaker of Skele-Gro.\n“Happy Valentine’s Day!” Lockhart shouted. “And may I thank the\nforty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty\nof arranging this little surprise for you all—and it doesn’t end here!”\nLockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall\nmarched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however.\nLockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.\n“My friendly, card-carrying cupids!” beamed Lockhart. “They will be\nroving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun\ndoesn’t stop here! I’m sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit\nof the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up\na Love Potion! And while you’re at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about\nEntrancing Enchantments than any wizard I’ve ever met, the sly old dog!”\nProfessor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was looking as\nthough the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed\npoison.\n“Please, Hermione, tell me you weren’t one of the forty-six,” said Ron\nas they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became\nvery interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn’t answer.\nAll day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver\nvalentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the\nGryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up\nwith Harry.\n“Oy, you! ’Arry Potter!” shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf,\nelbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.\nHot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line\nof first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to\nescape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking\npeople’s shins, and reached him before he’d gone two paces.\n“I’ve got a musical message to deliver to ’Arry Potter in person,” he\nsaid, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.\n“Not here,” Harry hissed, trying to escape.\n“Stay still!” grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry’s bag and\npulling him back.\n“Let me go!” Harry snarled, tugging."

His books, wand,\nparchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over\neverything.\nHarry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf\nstarted singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.\n“What’s going on here?” came the cold, drawling voice of Draco\nMalfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag,\ndesperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.\n“What’s all this commotion?” said another familiar voice as Percy\nWeasley arrived.\nLosing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized\nhim around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.\n“Right,” he said, sitting on Harry’s ankles. “Here is your singing\nvalentine:\nHis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,\nHis hair is as dark as a blackboard.\nI wish he was mine, he’s really divine,\nThe hero who conquered the Dark Lord.”\nHarry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the\nspot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet\nnumb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to\ndisperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.\n“Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class,\nnow,” he said, shooing some of the younger students away. “And you,\nMalfoy—”\nHarry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something.\nLeering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he’d got\nRiddle’s diary.\n“Give that back,” said Harry quietly.\n“Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” said Malfoy, who obviously\nhadn’t noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry’s own diary.\nA hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry,\nlooking terrified.\n“Hand it over, Malfoy,” said Percy sternly.\n“When I’ve had a look,” said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at\nHarry.\nPercy said, “As a school prefect—” but Harry had lost his temper. He\npulled out his wand and shouted, “Expelliarmus!” and just as Snape had\ndisarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into\nthe air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.\n“Harry!” said Percy loudly. “No magic in the corridors. I’ll have to\nreport this, you know!”\nBut Harry didn’t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth\nfive points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as\nGinny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, “I\ndon’t think Potter liked your valentine much!”\nGinny covered her face with her hands and ran into class.

Ron didn’t need\nto spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.\nIt wasn’t until they had reached Professor Flitwick’s class that Harry\nnoticed something rather odd about Riddle’s diary. All his other books were\ndrenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been\nbefore the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to\nRon, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles\nwere blossoming out of the end, and he wasn’t much interested in anything\nelse.\n* * *\nHarry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This\nwas partly because he didn’t think he could stand Fred and George singing,\n“His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad” one more time, and partly\nbecause he wanted to examine Riddle’s diary again, and knew that Ron\nthought he was wasting his time.\nHarry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not\none of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out\nof his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the\nfirst page of the diary.\nThe ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it\nwas being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his\nquill a second time and wrote, “My name is Harry Potter.”\nThe words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without\ntrace. Then, at last, something happened.\nOozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry\nhad never written.\n“Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by\nmy diary?”\nThese words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to\nscribble back.\n“Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.”\nHe waited eagerly for Riddle’s reply.\n“Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than\nink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this\ndiary read.”\n“What do you mean?” Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his\nexcitement.\n“I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that\nwere covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft\nand Wizardry.”\n“That’s where I am now,” Harry wrote quickly. “I’m at Hogwarts, and\nhorrible stuff’s been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber\nof Secrets?”\nHis heart was hammering. Riddle’s reply came quickly, his writing\nbecoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.\n“Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets.

But the headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing\nhad happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given\nout that the girl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny,\nengraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But\nI knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had\nthe power to release it was not imprisoned.”\nHarry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.\n“It’s happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one\nseems to know who’s behind them. Who was it last time?”\n“I can show you, if you like,” came Riddle’s reply. “You don’t have to\ntake my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I\ncaught him.”\nHarry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle\nmean? How could he be taken inside somebody else’s memory? He glanced\nnervously at the door to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When he\nlooked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.\n“Let me show you.”\nHarry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.\n“OK.”\nThe pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind,\nstopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry\nsaw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a\nminuscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the\nbook to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what\nwas happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt\nhis body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in\nthe page, into a whirl of color and shadow.\nHe felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred\nshapes around him came suddenly into focus.\nHe knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the\nsleeping portraits was Dumbledore’s office—but it wasn’t Dumbledore who\nwas sitting behind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald except\nfor a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had\nnever seen this man before.\n“I’m sorry,” he said shakily. “I didn’t mean to butt in—”\nBut the wizard didn’t look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly.\nHarry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, “Er—I’ll just go, shall I?”\nStill the wizard ignored him. He didn’t seem even to have heard him.\nThinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.\n“Sorry I disturbed you. I’ll go now,” he half-shouted.\nThe wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past\nHarry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.\nThe sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The\nwizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching\nthe door.\nHarry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix—no whirring"

They told me at the\norphanage she lived just long enough to name me—Tom after my father,\nMarvolo after my grandfather.”\nDippet clucked his tongue sympathetically.\n“The thing is, Tom,” he sighed, “special arrangements might have been\nmade for you, but in the current circumstances…”\n“You mean all these attacks, sir?” said Riddle, and Harry’s heart leapt,\nand he moved closer, scared of missing anything.\n“Precisely,” said the headmaster. “My dear boy, you must see how\nfoolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term\nends.

        "text": "“You may go, Tom…”\nRiddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed\nhim.\nDown the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the\ngargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry,\nwatching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious\nthinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.\nThen, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off,\nHarry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn’t see another person until\nthey reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping\nauburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase.\n“What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?”\nHarry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-year-\nyounger Dumbledore.\n“I had to see the headmaster, sir,” said Riddle.\n“Well, hurry off to bed,” said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the\nkind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. “Best not to roam the\ncorridors these days. Not since…”\nHe sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle\nwatched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight\ndown the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit.\nBut to Harry’s disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden\npassageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had\nPotions with Snape. The torches hadn’t been lit, and when Riddle pushed\nthe door almost closed, Harry could only just see him, standing stock-still\nby the door, watching the passage outside.\nIt felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could\nsee was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting\nlike a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense\nand started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move\nbeyond the door.\nSomeone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was\npass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a\nshadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him,\nforgetting that he couldn’t be heard.\nFor perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle\nstopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry\nheard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper.\n“C’mon… gotta get yeh outta here… C’mon now… in the box…”\nThere was something familiar about that voice…\nRiddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind\nhim. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in\nfront of an open door, a very large box next to it.\n“’Evening, Rubeus,” said Riddle sharply.\nThe boy slammed the door shut and stood up.\n“What yer doin’ down here, Tom?”\nRiddle stepped closer.\n“It’s all over,” he said. “I’m going to have to turn you in, Rubeus.\nThey’re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don’t stop.”\n“What d’yeh—”\n“I don’t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don’t make good\npets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and—”"

I suppose you just let it out for exercise and—”\n“It never killed no one!” said the large boy, backing against the closed\ndoor. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking.\n“Come on, Rubeus,” said Riddle, moving yet closer. “The dead girl’s\nparents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that\nthe thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered…”\n“It wasn’t him!” roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage.\n“He wouldn’! He never!”\n“Stand aside,” said Riddle, drawing out his wand.\nHis spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind\nthe large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall\nopposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long,\npiercing scream unheard by anyone—\nA vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of\nmany eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers—Riddle raised his wand again,\nbut he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing\nup the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after\nit; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and\nthrew him back down, yelling, “NOOOOOOO!”\nThe scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself\nfalling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the\nGryffindor dormitory, Riddle’s diary lying open on his stomach.\nBefore he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened\nand Ron came in.\n“There you are,” he said.\nHarry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.\n“What’s up?” said Ron, looking at him with concern.\n“It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years\nago.”\nC\nHAPTER 14\nC F\nORNELIUS UDGE\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an\nunfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year\nat Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it\nwould be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d\nchristened “Fluffy.” And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was\nhidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he’d have gone to any\nlengths for a glimpse of it. He’d probably thought it was a shame that the\nmonster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to\nstretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid\ntrying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid\nwould never have meant to kill anybody.\nHarry half wished he hadn’t found out how to work Riddle’s diary.\nAgain and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he’d seen, until\nhe was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular\nconversations that followed.\n“Riddle might have got the wrong person,” said Hermione. “Maybe it\nwas some other monster that was attacking people…”"

Otherwise,\nRiddle wouldn’t have got his award.”\nRon tried a different tack.\n“Riddle does sound like Percy—who asked him to squeal on Hagrid,\nanyway?”\n“But the monster had killed someone, Ron,” said Hermione.\n“And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they\nclosed Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I don’t blame him for wanting to stay\nhere…”\n“You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn’t you, Harry?”\n“He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,” said Harry quickly.\nThe three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the\nknottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.\n“Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?”\n“That’d be a cheerful visit,” said Ron. “‘Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have\nyou been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?’”\nIn the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid\nunless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with\nno whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they\nwould never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. It was\nnow nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been\nPetrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it\nwas, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of his “Oh, Potter,\nyou rotter” song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a\nbucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of\nthe Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This\nmade Professor Sprout very happy.\n“The moment they start trying to move into each other’s pots, we’ll\nknow they’re fully mature,” she told Harry. “Then we’ll be able to revive\nthose poor people in the hospital wing.”\nThe second years were given something new to think about during\ntheir Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for the\nthird year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.\n“It could affect our whole future,” she told Harry and Ron as they\npored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.\n“I just want to give up Potions,” said Harry.\n“We can’t,” said Ron gloomily. “We keep all our old subjects, or I’d’ve\nditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.”\n“But that’s very important!” said Hermione, shocked.\n“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned\nanything from him except not to set pixies loose.”\nNeville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and\nwizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose.\nConfused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue\npoking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more"

Dean Thomas, who, like Harry,\nhad grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his\nwand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took\nnobody’s advice but signed up for everything.\nHarry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon\nand Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with\nthem. Not that he didn’t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to\nshare his experience.\n“Depends where you want to go, Harry,” he said. “It’s never too early\nto think about the future, so I’d recommend Divination. People say Muggle\nStudies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a\nthorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if\nthey’re thinking of working in close contact with them—look at my father,\nhe has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was\nalways more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures.\nPlay to your strengths, Harry.”\nBut the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In\nthe end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy\nat them, at least he’d have someone friendly to help him.\nGryffindor’s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood\nwas insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely\nhad time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training\nsessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before\nSaturday’s match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick\nfeeling Gryffindor’s chances for the Quidditch Cup had never been better.\nBut his cheerful mood didn’t last long. At the top of the stairs to the\ndormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.\n“Harry—I don’t know who did it—I just found—”\nWatching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door.\nThe contents of Harry’s trunk had been thrown everywhere. His cloak\nlay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster\nand the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents\nstrewn over the mattress.\nHarry walked over to the bed, openmouthed, treading on a few loose\npages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled the blankets back\nonto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly.\n“What happened, Harry?”\n“No idea,” said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry’s robes. All the\npockets were hanging out.\n“Someone’s been looking for something,” said Ron. “Is there anything\nmissing?”\nHarry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk. It\nwas only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he\nrealized what wasn’t there.\n“Riddle’s diary’s gone,” he said in an undertone to Ron.\n“What?”"

They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was\nhalf-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book\ncalled Ancient Runes Made Easy.\nHermione looked aghast at the news.\n“But—only a Gryffindor could have stolen—nobody else knows our\npassword—”\n“Exactly,” said Harry.\nThey woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing\nbreeze.\n“Perfect Quidditch conditions!” said Wood enthusiastically at the\nGryffindor table, loading the team’s plates with scrambled eggs. “Harry,\nbuck up there, you need a decent breakfast.”\nHarry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if\nthe new owner of Riddle’s diary was right in front of his eyes. Hermione\nhad been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn’t like the idea.\nHe’d have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew\nwhy Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? He didn’t want to be the one\nwho brought it all up again.\nAs he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his\nQuidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry’s growing\nlist. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again\n—\n“Kill this time… let me rip… tear…”\nHe shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him\nin alarm.\n“The voice!” said Harry, looking over his shoulder. “I just heard it\nagain—didn’t you?”\nRon shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a hand to\nher forehead.\n“Harry—I think I’ve just understood something! I’ve got to go to the\nlibrary!”\nAnd she sprinted away, up the stairs.\n“What does she understand?” said Harry distractedly, still looking\naround, trying to tell where the voice had come from.\n“Loads more than I do,” said Ron, shaking his head.\n“But why’s she got to go to the library?”\n“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging. “When in\ndoubt, go to the library.”\nHarry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were\nnow emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting\nthrough the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.\n“You’d better get moving,” said Ron. “It’s nearly eleven—the match\n—”\nHarry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two\nThousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his\nmind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled\non his scarlet robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone\nwas now outside to watch the game.\nThe teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause.

The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a\nhuddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics.\nHarry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall came\nhalf marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple\nmegaphone.\nHarry’s heart dropped like a stone.\n“This match has been canceled,” Professor McGonagall called through\nthe megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were boos and\nshouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor\nMcGonagall without getting off his broomstick.\n“But, Professor!” he shouted. “We’ve got to play—the Cup—\nGryffindor—”\nProfessor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her\nmegaphone:\n“All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms,\nwhere their Heads of Houses will give them further information. As quickly\nas you can, please!”\nThen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.\n“Potter, I think you’d better come with me…”\nWondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry saw\nRon detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up to\nthem as they set off toward the castle. To Harry’s surprise, Professor\nMcGonagall didn’t object.\n“Yes, perhaps you’d better come, too, Weasley…”\nSome of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the\nmatch being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ron followed\nProfessor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase. But\nthey weren’t taken to anybody’s office this time.\n“This will be a bit of a shock,” said Professor McGonagall in a\nsurprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. “There has been\nanother attack… another double attack.”\nHarry’s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall\npushed the door open and he and Ron entered.\nMadam Pomfrey was bending over a sixth-year girl with long, curly\nhair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they’d accidentally asked for\ndirections to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to her was—\n“Hermione!” Ron groaned.\nHermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.\n“They were found near the library,” said Professor McGonagall. “I\ndon’t suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next to\nthem…”\nShe was holding up a small, circular mirror.\nHarry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione.\n“I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Professor\nMcGonagall heavily. “I need to address the students in any case.”\n“All students will return to their House common rooms by six o’clock\nin the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time. You\nwill be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use the\nbathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch training and\nmatches are to be postponed.

        "text": "matches are to be postponed. There will be no more evening activities.”\nThe Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor\nMcGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment from which she had\nbeen reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, “I need hardly add that I\nhave rarely been so distressed. It is likely that the school will be closed\nunless the culprit behind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who\nthinks they might know anything about them to come forward.”\nShe climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the\nGryffindors began talking immediately.\n“That’s two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one\nRavenclaw, and one Hufflepuff,” said the Weasley twins’ friend Lee Jordan,\ncounting on his fingers. “Haven’t any of the teachers noticed that the\nSlytherins are all safe? Isn’t it obvious all this stuff’s coming from\nSlytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin—why don’t they\njust chuck all the Slytherins out?” he roared, to nods and scattered applause.\nPercy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn’t\nseem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned.\n“Percy’s in shock,” George told Harry quietly. “That Ravenclaw girl—\nPenelope Clearwater—she’s a prefect. I don’t think he thought the monster\nwould dare attack a prefect.”\nBut Harry was only half-listening. He didn’t seem to be able to get rid\nof the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out\nof stone. And if the culprit wasn’t caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime\nback with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was\nfaced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry\nnow knew exactly how he had felt.\n“What’re we going to do?” said Ron quietly in Harry’s ear. “D’you\nthink they suspect Hagrid?”\n“We’ve got to go and talk to him,” said Harry, making up his mind. “I\ncan’t believe it’s him this time, but if he set the monster loose last time he’ll\nknow how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start.”\n“But McGonagall said we’ve got to stay in our tower unless we’re in\nclass—”\n“I think,” said Harry, more quietly still, “it’s time to get my dad’s old\ncloak out again.”\nHarry had inherited just one thing from his father: a long and silvery\nInvisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to\nvisit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at the usual\ntime, waited until Neville, Dean, and Seamus had stopped discussing the\nChamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and\nthrew the cloak over themselves.\nThe journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn’t\nenjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night several times before,\nhad never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teachers, prefects, and ghosts\nwere marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual\nactivity. Their Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop them making any noise, and"

Their Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop them making any noise, and\nthere was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards\nfrom the spot where Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed\nat almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they\nreached the oak front doors and eased them open.\nIt was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows of\nHagrid’s house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside\nhis front door.\nSeconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They found\nthemselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang the\nboarhound barked loudly behind him.\n“Oh,” he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. “What’re you\ntwo doin’ here?”\n“What’s that for?” said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they stepped\ninside.\n“Nothin’—nothin’—“Hagrid muttered. “I’ve bin expectin’—doesn’\nmatter—Sit down—I’ll make tea—”\nHe hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly extinguished\nthe fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot\nwith a nervous jerk of his massive hand.\n“Are you okay, Hagrid?” said Harry. “Did you hear about Hermione?”\n“Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice.\nHe kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both large\nmugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and was just\nputting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the\ndoor.\nHagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged panic-stricken\nlooks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated\ninto a corner. Hagrid checked that they were hidden, seized his crossbow,\nand flung open his door once more.\n“Good evening, Hagrid.”\nIt was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was\nfollowed by a second, very odd-looking man.\nThe stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and\nwas wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a\nlong black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he carried a lime-\ngreen bowler.\n“That’s Dad’s boss!” Ron breathed. “Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of\nMagic!”\nHarry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.\nHagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs\nand looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.\n“Bad business, Hagrid,” said Fudge in rather clipped tones. “Very bad\nbusiness. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things’ve gone far\nenough. Ministry’s got to act.”\n“I never,” said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. “You\nknow I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir—”\n“I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,”\nsaid Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.\n“Look, Albus,” said Fudge, uncomfortably. “Hagrid’s record’s against"

If someone else is caught, you’ll\nbe let out with a full apology—”\n“Not Azkaban?” croaked Hagrid.\nBefore Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.\nDumbledore answered it. It was Harry’s turn for an elbow in the ribs;\nhe’d let out an audible gasp.\nMr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid’s hut, swathed in a long black\ntraveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile.

I’m\nafraid we feel you’re losing your touch. How many attacks have there been\nnow? Two more this afternoon, wasn’t it?

He looked at\nLucius Malfoy.\n“If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside\n—”\n“But—” stuttered Fudge.\n“No!” growled Hagrid.\nDumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy’s\ncold gray ones.\n“However,” said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that\nnone of them could miss a word, “you will find that I will only truly have\nleft this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help\nwill always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.”\nFor a second, Harry was almost sure Dumbledore’s eyes flickered\ntoward the corner where he and Ron stood hidden.\n“Admirable sentiments,” said Malfoy, bowing. “We shall all miss your\n—er—highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope that\nyour successor will manage to prevent any—ah—killins.”\nHe strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed Dumbledore out.\nFudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for Hagrid to go ahead of him, but\nHagrid stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said carefully, “If anyone\nwanted ter find out some stuff, all they’d have ter do would be ter follow the\nspiders. That’d lead ’em right! That’s all I’m sayin’.”\nFudge stared at him in amazement.\n“All right, I’m comin’,” said Hagrid, pulling on his moleskin overcoat.\nBut as he was about to follow Fudge through the door, he stopped again and\nsaid loudly, “An’ someone’ll need ter feed Fang while I’m away.”\nThe door banged shut and Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak.\n“We’re in trouble now,” he said hoarsely. “No Dumbledore. They\nmight as well close the school tonight. There’ll be an attack a day with him\ngone.”\nFang started howling, scratching at the closed door.\nC\nHAPTER 15\nA\nRAGOG\nSummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake\nalike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom\nin the greenhouses.

But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows,\nstriding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn’t look right to\nHarry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so\nhorribly wrong.\nHarry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now\nbarred from the hospital wing.\n“We’re taking no more chances,” Madam Pomfrey told them severely\nthrough a crack in the infirmary door. “No, I’m sorry, there’s every chance\nthe attacker might come back to finish these people off…”\nWith Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the\nsun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned\nwindows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn’t look\nworried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded\nshrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.\nHarry constantly repeated Dumbledore’s final words to himself. “I will\nonly truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me… Help will\nalways be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.” But what good were\nthese words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when\neveryone was just as confused and scared as they were?\nHagrid’s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand—the\ntrouble was, there didn’t seem to be a single spider left in the castle to\nfollow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by\nRon. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren’t allowed\nto wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with\nthe other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they\nwere being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it\nvery irksome.\nOne person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the\natmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the\nschool as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn’t realize\nwhat he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after\nDumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry\noverheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.\n“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of\nDumbledore,” he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you he\nthinks Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe\nwe’ll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t want the Chamber\nof Secrets closed. McGonagall won’t last long, she’s only filling in…”\nSnape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione’s empty\nseat and cauldron.\n“Sir,” said Malfoy loudly. “Sir, why don’t you apply for the\nheadmaster’s job?”\n“Now, now, Malfoy,” said Snape, though he couldn’t suppress a thin-\nlipped smile. “Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the\ngovernors. I daresay he’ll be back with us soon enough.”\n“Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smirking. “I expect you’d have Father’s\nvote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job—I’ll tell Father you’re the best\nteacher here, sir—”\nSnape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not"

Pity it\nwasn’t Granger—”\nThe bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy’s last words,\nRon had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books,\nhis attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.\n“Let me at him,” Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms.\n“I don’t care, I don’t need my wand, I’m going to kill him with my bare\nhands—”\n“Hurry up, I’ve got to take you all to Herbology,” barked Snape over\nthe class’s heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing\nup the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only safe to let go of him\nwhen Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their\nway across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.\nThe Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing\nfrom their number, Justin and Hermione.\nProfessor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian\nShrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost\nheap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took a\ndeep breath and said, very formally, “I just want to say, Harry, that I’m\nsorry I ever suspected you. I know you’d never attack Hermione Granger,\nand I apologize for all the stuff I said. We’re all in the same boat now, and,\nwell—”\nHe held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.\nErnie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as\nHarry and Ron.\n“That Draco Malfoy character,” said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs,\n“he seems very pleased about all this, doesn’t he? D’you know, I think he\nmight be Slytherin’s heir.”\n“That’s clever of you,” said Ron, who didn’t seem to have forgiven\nErnie as readily as Harry.\n“Do you think it’s Malfoy, Harry?” Ernie asked.\n“No,” said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared.\nA second later, Harry spotted something.\nSeveral large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side\nof the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the\nshortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand with\nhis pruning shears.\n“Ouch! What’re you—”\nHarry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes\nscrewed up against the sun.\n“Oh, yeah,” said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. “But we\ncan’t follow them now—”\nErnie and Hannah were listening curiously.\nHarry’s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued\ntheir fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up.\n“Looks like they’re heading for the Forbidden Forest…”"

If they pursued\ntheir fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up.\n“Looks like they’re heading for the Forbidden Forest…”\nAnd Ron looked even unhappier about that.\nAt the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their\nDefense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind the\nothers so they could talk out of earshot.\n“We’ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,” Harry told Ron. “We\ncan take Fang with us. He’s used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he\nmight be some help.”\n“Right,” said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers.\n“Er—aren’t there—aren’t there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?”\nhe added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart’s\nclassroom.\nPreferring not to answer that question, Harry said, “There are good\nthings in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns…”\nRon had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had\nentered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.\nLockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every\nother teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart\nappeared nothing short of buoyant.\n“Come now,” he cried, beaming around him. “Why all these long\nfaces?”\nPeople swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.\n“Don’t you people realize,” said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though\nthey were all a bit dim, “the danger has passed! The culprit has been taken\naway—”\n“Says who?” said Dean Thomas loudly.\n“My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn’t have taken\nHagrid if he hadn’t been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,” said\nLockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two.\n“Oh, yes he would,” said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.\n“I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid’s arrest than you\ndo, Mr. Weasley,” said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone.\nRon started to say that he didn’t think so, somehow, but stopped in\nmidsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.\n“We weren’t there, remember?” Harry muttered.\nBut Lockhart’s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always\nthought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business was\nnow at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding\nwith Ghouls right in Lockhart’s stupid face. Instead he contented himself\nwith scrawling a note to Ron: Let’s do it tonight.\nRon read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the\nempty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his\nresolve, and he nodded.\nThe Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days,\nbecause from six o’clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go.\nThey also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room\noften didn’t empty until past midnight.\nHarry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after\ndinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear."

Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games\nquickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and\nGinny finally went to bed.\nHarry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors\nclosing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing\nthrough the portrait hole.\nIt was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the\nteachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak\nfront doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and\nstepped out into the moonlit grounds.\n“’Course,” said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, “we\nmight get to the forest and find there’s nothing to follow. Those spiders\nmight not’ve been going there at all. I know it looked like they were\nmoving in that sort of general direction, but…”\nHis voice trailed away hopefully.\nThey reached Hagrid’s house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank\nwindows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at\nthe sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his\ndeep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle toffee from a tin on the\nmantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.\nHarry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid’s table. There would be no\nneed for it in the pitch-dark forest.\n“C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” said Harry, patting his leg, and\nFang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of\nthe forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.\nHarry took out his wand, murmured, “Lumos!” and a tiny light\nappeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of\nspiders.\n“Good thinking,” said Ron. “I’d light mine, too, but you know—it’d\nprobably blow up or something…”\nHarry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary\nspiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.\n“Okay,” Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, “I’m ready. Let’s\ngo.”\nSo, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves,\nthey entered the forest. By the glow of Harry’s wand, they followed the\nsteady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them\nfor about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than\nbreaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become\nthicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and\nHarry’s wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides\nleaving the path.\nHarry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but\neverything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black.

He could vividly remember Hagrid\nadvising him not to leave the forest path last time he’d been in here. But\nHagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he\nhad also said to follow the spiders.\nSomething wet touched Harry’s hand and he jumped backward,\ncrushing Ron’s foot, but it was only Fang’s nose.\n“What d’you reckon?” Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just\nmake out, reflecting the light from his wand.\n“We’ve come this far,” said Ron.\nSo they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees.\nThey couldn’t move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in\ntheir way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang’s hot\nbreath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could\ncrouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.\nThey walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes\nsnagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed\nthat the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as\nthick as ever.\nThen Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry\nand Ron jump out of their skins.\n“What?” said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and\ngripping Harry’s elbow very hard.\n“There’s something moving over there,” Harry breathed. “Listen…\nsounds like something big…”\nThey listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was\nsnapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.\n“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh—”\n“Shut up,” said Harry frantically. “It’ll hear you.”\n“Hear me?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. “It’s already heard\nFang!”\nThe darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood,\nterrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.\n“What d’you think it’s doing?” said Harry.\n“Probably getting ready to pounce,” said Ron.\nThey waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.\n“D’you think it’s gone?” Harry whispered.\n“Dunno—”\nThen, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the\ndarkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang\nyelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even\nlouder.\n“Harry!” Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief. “Harry, it’s our\ncar!”\n“What?”\n“Come on!”\nHarry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping,\nand a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.\nMr. Weasley’s car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of\nthick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron\nwalked, openmouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a\nlarge, turquoise dog greeting its owner."

As Ron\nwalked, openmouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a\nlarge, turquoise dog greeting its owner.\n“It’s been here all the time!” said Ron delightedly, walking around the\ncar. “Look at it. The forest’s turned it wild…”\nThe sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently\nit had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. Fang didn’t seem at\nall keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering. His\nbreathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes.\n“And we thought it was going to attack us!” said Ron, leaning against\nthe car and patting it. “I wondered where it had gone!”\nHarry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders,\nbut they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.\n“We’ve lost the trail,” he said. “C’mon, let’s go and find them.”\nRon didn’t speak. He didn’t move. His eyes were fixed on a point\nsome ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was livid\nwith terror.\nHarry didn’t even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking\nnoise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the\nmiddle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown.\nStruggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron’s legs leave the\nground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling—next moment, he was\nbeing swept away into the dark trees.\nHead hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on\nsix immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a\npair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the\ncreatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of\nthe forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third\nmonster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn’t have yelled even if he had\nwanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the\nclearing.\nHe never knew how long he was in the creature’s clutches; he only\nknew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-\nstrewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways,\nhe realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that\nhad been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst\nscene he had ever laid eyes on.\nSpiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below.\nSpiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy,\ngigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down\nthe steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow,\nwhile its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at\nthe sight of its load.\nHarry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron\nand Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn’t howling anymore, but\ncowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth\nwas stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping."

His mouth\nwas stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping.\nHarry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was\nsaying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers\nwith every word he spoke.\n“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!”\nAnd from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a\nsmall elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his\nbody and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky\nwhite. He was blind.\n“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.\n“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.\n“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes\nwandering vaguely.\n“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.\n“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping…”\n“We’re friends of Hagrid’s,” Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have\nleft his chest to pound in his throat.\nClick, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.\nAragog paused.\n“Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,” he said slowly.\n“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harry, breathing very fast. “That’s why\nwe’ve come.”\n“In trouble?” said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern\nbeneath the clicking pincers. “But why has he sent you?”\nHarry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn’t\nthink his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as calmly\nas he could.\n“They think, up at the school, that Hagrid’s been setting a—a—\nsomething on students. They’ve taken him to Azkaban.”\nAragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the\nsound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except\napplause didn’t usually make Harry feel sick with fear.\n“But that was years ago,” said Aragog fretfully. “Years and years ago. I\nremember it well. That’s why they made him leave the school. They\nbelieved that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of\nSecrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me\nfree.”\n“And you… you didn’t come from the Chamber of Secrets?” said\nHarry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.\n“I!” said Aragog, clicking angrily. “I was not born in the castle. I come\nfrom a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg.\nHagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the\ncastle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid is my good friend, and a\ngood man. When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he\nprotected me. I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid still\nvisits me. He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family\nhas grown, all through Hagrid’s goodness…”\nHarry summoned what remained of his courage.\n“So you never—never attacked anyone?”"

The body of the girl\nwho was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of the\ncastle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like the dark and the\nquiet…”\n“But then… Do you know what did kill that girl?” said Harry.\n“Because whatever it is, it’s back and attacking people again—”\nHis words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the\nrustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all\naround him.\n“The thing that lives in the castle,” said Aragog, “is an ancient creature\nwe spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with\nHagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.”\n“What is it?” said Harry urgently.\nMore loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.\n“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I\nnever even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked\nme, many times.”\nHarry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing\ncloser on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing\nslowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly\ntoward Harry and Ron.\n“We’ll just go, then,” Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing\nleaves rustling behind him.\n“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not…”\n“But—but—”\n“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I\ncannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst.\nGood-bye, friend of Hagrid.”\nHarry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of\nspiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads.\nEven as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there\nwere too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a\nloud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow.\nMr. Weasley’s car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring,\nits horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their\nbacks, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to a halt in\nfront of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open.\n“Get Fang!” Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the\nboarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the\ncar—the doors slammed shut—Ron didn’t touch the accelerator but the car\ndidn’t need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders.\nThey sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing\nthrough the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car wound its\nway cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.\nHarry looked sideways at Ron.

His mouth was still open in the silent\nscream, but his eyes weren’t popping anymore.\n“Are you okay?”\nRon stared straight ahead, unable to speak.\nThey smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling\nloudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they\nsqueezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned,\nand Harry could again see patches of sky.\nThe car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the\nwindshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung himself at\nthe window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he\nshot off through the trees to Hagrid’s house, tail between his legs. Harry got\nout too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his\nlimbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a\ngrateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view.\nHarry went back into Hagrid’s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang\nwas trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again,\nhe found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch.\n“Follow the spiders,” said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his\nsleeve. “I’ll never forgive Hagrid. We’re lucky to be alive.”\n“I bet he thought Aragog wouldn’t hurt friends of his,” said Harry.\n“That’s exactly Hagrid’s problem!” said Ron, thumping the wall of the\ncabin. “He always thinks monsters aren’t as bad as they’re made out, and\nlook where it’s got him! A cell in Azkaban!” He was shivering\nuncontrollably now. “What was the point of sending us in there? What have\nwe found out, I’d like to know?”\n“That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,” said Harry,\nthrowing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him\nwalk. “He was innocent.”\nRon gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard\nwasn’t his idea of being innocent.\nAs the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure\ntheir feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They\nwalked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase,\nholding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were\nwalking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room,\nwhere the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off the cloak\nand climbed the winding stair to their dormitory.\nRon fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry,\nhowever, didn’t feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter,\nthinking hard about everything Aragog had said.\nThe creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought,\nsounded like a sort of monster Voldemort—even other monsters didn’t want\nto name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or\nhow it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the\nChamber of Secrets."

Even Hagrid had never known what was in the\nChamber of Secrets.\nHarry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his\npillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.\nHe couldn’t see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends\neverywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had\ngot off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different\none, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask.\nHarry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said.\nHe was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope\noccurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.\n“Ron,” he hissed through the dark, “Ron—”\nRon woke with a yelp like Fang’s, stared wildly around, and saw\nHarry.\n“Ron—that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,”\nsaid Harry, ignoring Neville’s snuffling snores from the corner. “What if she\nnever left the bathroom? What if she’s still there?”\nRon rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he\nunderstood, too.\n“You don’t think—not Moaning Myrtle?”\nC\nHAPTER 16\nT C S\nHE HAMBER OF ECRETS\nAll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just three toilets\naway,” said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day, “and we could’ve asked her,\nand now…”\nIt had been hard enough trying to look for spiders.

Professor McGonagall\nrestored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus.\n“The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to\nreceive your education,” she said sternly. “The exams will therefore take\nplace as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.”\nStudying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be\nexams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous\nmuttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl even\nmore darkly.\n“Professor Dumbledore’s instructions were to keep the school running\nas normally as possible,” she said. “And that, I need hardly point out, means\nfinding out how much you have learned this year.”\nHarry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be\nturning into slippers.

        "text": "finding out how much you have learned this year.”\nHarry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be\nturning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn’t\nseem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.\nRon looked as though he’d just been told he had to go and live in the\nForbidden Forest.\n“Can you imagine me taking exams with this?” he asked Harry,\nholding up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.\nThree days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made\nanother announcement at breakfast.\n“I have good news,” she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling\nsilent, erupted.\n“Dumbledore’s coming back!” several people yelled joyfully.\n“You’ve caught the Heir of Slytherin!” squealed a girl at the\nRavenclaw table.\n“Quidditch matches are back on!” roared Wood excitedly.\nWhen the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said,\n“Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting\nat last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who have been\nPetrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to\ntell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that this dreadful year will\nend with our catching the culprit.”\nThere was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the Slytherin\ntable and wasn’t at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn’t joined in.\nRon, however, was looking happier than he’d looked in days.\n“It won’t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!” he said to Harry.\n“Hermione’ll probably have all the answers when they wake her up! Mind\nyou, she’ll go crazy when she finds out we’ve got exams in three days’ time.\nShe hasn’t studied. It might be kinder to leave her where she is till they’re\nover.”\nJust then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. She\nlooked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in\nher lap.\n“What’s up?” said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.\nGinny didn’t say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor\ntable with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone,\nthough he couldn’t think who.\n“Spit it out,” said Ron, watching her.\nHarry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking\nbackward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did when he\nwas teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.\n“I’ve got to tell you something,” Ginny mumbled, carefully not\nlooking at Harry.\n“What is it?” said Harry.\nGinny looked as though she couldn’t find the right words.\n“What?” said Ron.\nGinny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned\nforward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him.\n“Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen\nsomething? Someone acting oddly?”\nGinny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasley\nappeared, looking tired and wan.\n“If you’ve finished eating, I’ll take that seat, Ginny. I’m starving, I’ve\nonly just come off patrol duty.”"

I’m starving, I’ve\nonly just come off patrol duty.”\nGinny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave\nPercy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy sat down and\ngrabbed a mug from the center of the table.\n“Percy!” said Ron angrily. “She was just about to tell us something\nimportant!”\nHalfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked.\n“What sort of thing?” he said, coughing.\n“I just asked her if she’d seen anything odd, and she started to say—”\n“Oh—that—that’s nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,” said\nPercy at once.\n“How do you know?” said Ron, his eyebrows raised.\n“Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day\nwhen I was—well, never mind—the point is, she spotted me doing\nsomething and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to anybody. I must say, I\ndid think she’d keep her word. It’s nothing, really, I’d just rather—”\nHarry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.\n“What were you doing, Percy?” said Ron, grinning. “Go on, tell us, we\nwon’t laugh.”\nPercy didn’t smile back.\n“Pass me those rolls, Harry, I’m starving.”\nHarry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without\ntheir help, but he wasn’t about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it\nturned up—and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were being led\nto History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.\nLockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed,\nonly to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly convinced\nthat it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the corridors.\nHis hair wasn’t as sleek as usual; it seemed he had been up most of the\nnight, patrolling the fourth floor.\n“Mark my words,” he said, ushering them around a corner. “The first\nwords out of those poor Petrified people’s mouths will be ‘It was Hagrid.’\nFrankly, I’m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security\nmeasures are necessary.”\n“I agree, sir,” said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.\n“Thank you, Harry,” said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a\nlong line of Hufflepuffs to pass. “I mean, we teachers have quite enough to\nbe getting on with, without walking students to classes and standing guard\nall night…”\n“That’s right,” said Ron, catching on. “Why don’t you leave us here,\nsir, we’ve only got one more corridor to go—”\n“You know, Weasley, I think I will,” said Lockhart. “I really should go\nand prepare my next class—”\nAnd he hurried off.\n“Prepare his class,” Ron sneered after him. “Gone to curl his hair,\nmore like.”\nThey let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted\ndown a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.\nBut just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme—"

Weasley! What are you doing?”\nIt was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin\nlines.\n“We were—we were—” Ron stammered. “We were going to—to go\nand see—”\n“Hermione,” said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked\nat him.\n“We haven’t seen her for ages, Professor,” Harry went on hurriedly,\ntreading on Ron’s foot, “and we thought we’d sneak into the hospital wing,\nyou know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry\n—”\nProfessor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment,\nHarry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a\nstrangely croaky voice.\n“Of course,” she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her\nbeady eye. “Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of\nthose who have been… I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you may\nvisit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns where you’ve gone. Tell\nMadam Pomfrey I have given my permission.”\nHarry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they’d\navoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard Professor\nMcGonagall blow her nose.\n“That,” said Ron fervently, “was the best story you’ve ever come up\nwith.”\nThey had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam\nPomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall’s permission to visit\nHermione.\nMadam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.\n“There’s just no point talking to a Petrified person,” she said, and they\nhad to admit she had a point when they’d taken their seats next to\nHermione. It was plain that Hermione didn’t have the faintest inkling that\nshe had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not\nto worry for all the good it would do.\n“Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” said Ron, looking sadly\nat Hermione’s rigid face. “Because if he sneaked up on them all, no one’ll\never know…”\nBut Harry wasn’t looking at Hermione’s face. He was more interested\nin her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending closer,\nhe saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.\nMaking sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this\nout to Ron.\n“Try and get it out,” Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he\nblocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey’s view.\nIt was no easy task. Hermione’s hand was clamped so tightly around\nthe paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept watch\nhe tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the paper\ncame free.\nIt was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out\neagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too."

        "text": "came free.\nIt was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out\neagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.\nOf the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land,\nthere is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known\nalso as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size\nand live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken’s egg, hatched\nbeneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside\nfrom its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous\nstare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant\ndeath. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and\nthe Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to\nit.\nAnd beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry\nrecognized as Hermione’s. Pipes.\nIt was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.\n“Ron,” he breathed. “This is it. This is the answer. The monster in the\nChamber’s a basilisk—a giant serpent! That’s why I’ve been hearing that\nvoice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It’s because I\nunderstand Parseltongue…”\nHarry looked up at the beds around him.\n“The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one’s died—\nbecause no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through his\ncamera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got\nPetrified. Justin… Justin must’ve seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless\nNick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn’t die again… and\nHermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to\nthem. Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk. I bet you\nanything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a\nmirror first! And that girl pulled out her mirror—and—”\nRon’s jaw had dropped.\n“And Mrs. Norris?” he whispered eagerly.\nHarry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.\n“The water…” he said slowly. “The flood from Moaning Myrtle’s\nbathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection…”\nHe scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at it, the\nmore it made sense.\n“…The crowing of the rooster… is fatal to it!” he read aloud.\n“Hagrid’s roosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn’t want one\nanywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spiders flee before\nit! It all fits!”\n“But how’s the basilisk been getting around the place?” said Ron. “A\ngiant snake… Someone would’ve seen…”\nHarry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the\nfoot of the page.\n“Pipes,” he said. “Pipes… Ron, it’s been using the plumbing. I’ve been\nhearing that voice inside the walls…”\nRon suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm.\n“The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!” he said hoarsely. “What if\nit’s a bathroom? What if it’s in—”"

What if it’s in—”\n“—Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom,” said Harry.\nThey sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able to\nbelieve it.\n“This means,” said Harry, “I can’t be the only Parselmouth in the\nschool. The Heir of Slytherin’s one, too. That’s how he’s been controlling\nthe basilisk.”\n“What’re we going to do?” said Ron, whose eyes were flashing.\n“Should we go straight to McGonagall?”\n“Let’s go to the staffroom,” said Harry, jumping up. “She’ll be there in\nten minutes. It’s nearly break.”\nThey ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging around in\nanother corridor, they went straight into the deserted staffroom. It was a\nlarge, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. Harry and Ron paced\naround it, too excited to sit down.\nBut the bell to signal break never came.\nInstead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGonagall’s\nvoice, magically magnified.\n“All students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teachers\nreturn to the staffroom. Immediately, please.”\nHarry wheeled around to stare at Ron.\n“Not another attack? Not now?”\n“What’ll we do?” said Ron, aghast. “Go back to the dormitory?”\n“No,” said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of wardrobe\nto his left, full of the teachers’ cloaks. “In here. Let’s hear what it’s all\nabout. Then we can tell them what we’ve found out.”\nThey hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of\npeople moving overhead, and the staffroom door banging open. From\nbetween the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers filtering\ninto the room. Some of them were looking puzzled, others downright\nscared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived.\n“It has happened,” she told the silent staffroom. “A student has been\ntaken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.”\nProfessor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped her hands\nover her mouth. Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard and said, “How\ncan you be sure?”\n“The Heir of Slytherin,” said Professor McGonagall, who was very\nwhite, “left another message. Right underneath the first one. ‘Her skeleton\nwill lie in the Chamber forever.’”\nProfessor Flitwick burst into tears.\n“Who is it?” said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a\nchair. “Which student?”\n“Ginny Weasley,” said Professor McGonagall.\nHarry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside him.\n“We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,” said\nProfessor McGonagall. “This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore always\nsaid…”\nThe staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment, Harry\nwas sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and he was\nbeaming.\n“So sorry—dozed off—what have I missed?”\nHe didn’t seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him"

But it was Lockhart, and he was\nbeaming.\n“So sorry—dozed off—what have I missed?”\nHe didn’t seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him\nwith something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward.\n“Just the man,” he said. “The very man. A girl has been snatched by\nthe monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your\nmoment has come at last.”\nLockhart blanched.\n“That’s right, Gilderoy,” chipped in Professor Sprout. “Weren’t you\nsaying just last night that you’ve known all along where the entrance to the\nChamber of Secrets is?”\n“I—well, I—” sputtered Lockhart.\n“Yes, didn’t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?”\npiped up Professor Flitwick.\n“D-did I? I don’t recall—”\n“I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn’t had a\ncrack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,” said Snape. “Didn’t you\nsay that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been\ngiven a free rein from the first?”\nLockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.\n“I—I really never—you may have misunderstood—”\n“We’ll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,” said Professor McGonagall.\n“Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We’ll make sure everyone’s out\nof your way. You’ll be able to tackle the monster all by yourself. A free rein\nat last.”\nLockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the\nrescue. He didn’t look remotely handsome anymore. His lip was trembling,\nand in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked weak-chinned and\nfeeble.\n“V-very well,” he said. “I’ll—I’ll be in my office, getting—getting\nready.”\nAnd he left the room.\n“Right,” said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared,\n“that’s got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses should go and\ninform their students what has happened. Tell them the Hogwarts Express\nwill take them home first thing tomorrow. Will the rest of you please make\nsure no students have been left outside their dormitories.”\nThe teachers rose and left, one by one.\nIt was probably the worst day of Harry’s entire life. He, Ron, Fred, and\nGeorge sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room, unable to\nsay anything to each other. Percy wasn’t there. He had gone to send an owl\nto Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in his dormitory.\nNo afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor Tower\never been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred and George went up\nto bed, unable to sit there any longer.\n“She knew something, Harry,” said Ron, speaking for the first time\nsince they had entered the wardrobe in the staffroom. “That’s why she was\ntaken. It wasn’t some stupid thing about Percy at all. She’d found out\nsomething about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be why she was—”\nRon rubbed his eyes frantically. “I mean, she was a pureblood. There can’t\nbe any other reason.”"

There can’t\nbe any other reason.”\nHarry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This\nwas the worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do.\nAnything.\n“Harry,” said Ron. “D’you think there’s any chance at all she’s not—\nyou know—”\nHarry didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t see how Ginny could still\nbe alive.\n“D’you know what?” said Ron. “I think we should go and see\nLockhart. Tell him what we know. He’s going to try and get into the\nChamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it’s a basilisk in\nthere.”\nBecause Harry couldn’t think of anything else to do, and because he\nwanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around them\nwere so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to\nstop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait\nhole.\nDarkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart’s office. There\nseemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hear scraping,\nthumps, and hurried footsteps.\nHarry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the\ndoor opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart’s eyes peering\nthrough it.\n“Oh—Mr. Potter—Mr. Weasley—” he said, opening the door a bit\nwider. “I’m rather busy at the moment—if you would be quick—”\n“Professor, we’ve got some information for you,” said Harry. “We\nthink it’ll help you.”\n“Er—well—it’s not terribly—” The side of Lockhart’s face that they\ncould see looked very uncomfortable. “I mean—well—all right—”\nHe opened the door and they entered.\nHis office had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunks stood\nopen on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnight-blue, had been hastily\nfolded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into the other. The\nphotographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on\nthe desk.\n“Are you going somewhere?” said Harry.\n“Er, well, yes,” said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself\nfrom the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. “Urgent call\n—unavoidable—got to go—”\n“What about my sister?” said Ron jerkily.\n“Well, as to that—most unfortunate—” said Lockhart, avoiding their\neyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents into a\nbag. “No one regrets more than I—”\n“You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!” said Harry. “You\ncan’t go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!”\n“Well—I must say—when I took the job—” Lockhart muttered, now\npiling socks on top of his robes. “nothing in the job description—didn’t\nexpect—”\n“You mean you’re running away? said Harry disbelievingly. “After all\nthat stuff you did in your books—”"

My books wouldn’t have sold half as well if\npeople didn’t think I’d done all those things. No one wants to read about\nsome ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from\nwerewolves. He’d look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all.\nAnd the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee had a hairy chin. I mean,\ncome on—”\n“So you’ve just been taking credit for what a load of other people have\ndone?” said Harry incredulously.\n“Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, “it’s not\nnearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had to track these\npeople down. Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did.\nThen I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they wouldn’t remember\ndoing it. If there’s one thing I pride myself on, it’s my Memory Charms.\nNo, it’s been a lot of work, Harry. It’s not all book signings and publicity\nphotos, you know. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long hard\nslog.”\nHe banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.\n“Let’s see,” he said. “I think that’s everything. Yes. Only one thing\nleft.”\nHe pulled out his wand and turned to them.\n“Awfully sorry, boys, but I’ll have to put a Memory Charm on you\nnow. Can’t have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. I’d never sell\nanother book—”\nHarry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his,\nwhen Harry bellowed, “Expelliarmus!”\nLockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew\nhigh into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.\n“Shouldn’t have let Professor Snape teach us that one,” said Harry\nfuriously, kicking Lockhart’s trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up at him,\nfeeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand at him.\n“What d’you want me to do?” said Lockhart weakly. “I don’t know\nwhere the Chamber of Secrets is. There’s nothing I can do.”\n“You’re in luck,” said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint.\n“We think we know where it is. And what’s inside it. Let’s go.”\nThey marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs,\nalong the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the door\nof Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.\nThey sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he was\nshaking.\nMoaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet.\n“Oh, it’s you,” she said when she saw Harry. “What do you want this\ntime?”\n“To ask you how you died,” said Harry.\nMyrtle’s whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she had\nnever been asked such a flattering question."

She looked as though she had\nnever been asked such a flattering question.\n“Ooooh, it was dreadful,” she said with relish. “It happened right in\nhere. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. I’d hidden because\nOlive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked, and I\nwas crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said something\nfunny. A different language, I think it must have been. Anyway, what really\ngot me was that it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to\ngo and use his own toilet, and then—” Myrtle swelled importantly, her face\nshining. “I died.”\n“How?” said Harry.\n“No idea,” said Myrtle in hushed tones. “I just remember seeing a pair\nof great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was\nfloating away…” She looked dreamily at Harry. “And then I came back\nagain. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry\nshe’d ever laughed at my glasses.”\n“Where exactly did you see the eyes?” said Harry.\n“Somewhere there,” said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in\nfront of her toilet.\nHarry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well back, a\nlook of utter terror on his face.\nIt looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every inch of it, inside\nand out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: Scratched on the\nside of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake.\n“That tap’s never worked,” said Myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it.\n“Harry,” said Ron. “Say something. Something in Parseltongue.”\n“But—” Harry thought hard. The only times he’d ever managed to\nspeak Parseltongue were when he’d been faced with a real snake. He stared\nhard at the tiny engraving, trying to imagine it was real.\n“Open up,” he said.\nHe looked at Ron, who shook his head.\n“English,” he said.\nHarry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive.\nIf he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it were\nmoving.\n“Open up,” he said.\nExcept that the words weren’t what he heard; a strange hissing had\nescaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and\nbegan to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact, sank,\nright out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide enough for a\nman to slide into.\nHarry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind\nwhat he was going to do.\n“I’m going down there,” he said.\nHe couldn’t not go, not now they had found the entrance to the\nChamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that\nGinny might be alive.\n“Me too,” said Ron.\nThere was a pause.\n“Well, you hardly seem to need me,” said Lockhart, with a shadow of\nhis old smile. “I’ll just—”"

Lockhart slid his legs into\nthe pipe.\n“I really don’t think—” he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and\nhe slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himself slowly into\nthe pipe, then let go.\nIt was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see\nmore pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs, which\ntwisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew that he was\nfalling deeper below the school than even the dungeons. Behind him he\ncould hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.\nAnd then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen\nwhen he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with\na wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to\nstand in. Lockhart was getting to his feet a little ways away, covered in\nslime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of\nthe pipe, too.\n“We must be miles under the school,” said Harry, his voice echoing in\nthe black tunnel.\n“Under the lake, probably,” said Ron, squinting around at the dark,\nslimy walls.\nAll three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.\n“Lumos!” Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. “C’mon,” he\nsaid to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly\non the wet floor.\nThe tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead.\nTheir shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.\n“Remember,” Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward,\n“any sign of movement, close your eyes right away…”\nBut the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound\nthey heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a\nrat’s skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was\nlittered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine what\nGinny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around\na dark bend in the tunnel.\n“Harry—there’s something up there—” said Ron hoarsely, grabbing\nHarry’s shoulder.\nThey froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something\nhuge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn’t moving.\n“Maybe it’s asleep,” he breathed, glancing back at the other two.\nLockhart’s hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at\nthe thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.\nVery slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see,\nHarry edged forward, his wand held high."

The creature that had shed it\nmust have been twenty feet long at least.\n“Blimey,” said Ron weakly.\nThere was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart’s\nknees had given way.\n“Get up,” said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.\nLockhart got to his feet—then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the\nground.\nHarry jumped forward, but too late—Lockhart was straightening up,\npanting, Ron’s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face.\n“The adventure ends here, boys!” he said. “I shall take a bit of this skin\nback up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you\ntwo tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body—say good-\nbye to your memories!”\nHe raised Ron’s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled,\n“Obliviate!”\nThe wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his\narms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the\nway of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next\nmoment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock.\n“Ron!” he shouted. “Are you okay? Ron!”\n“I’m here!” came Ron’s muffled voice from behind the rock-fall. “I’m\nokay—this git’s not, though—he got blasted by the wand—”\nThere was a dull thud and a loud “ow!” It sounded as though Ron had\njust kicked Lockhart in the shins.\n“What now?” Ron’s voice said, sounding desperate. “We can’t get\nthrough—it’ll take ages…”\nHarry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it.\nHe had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic,\nand now didn’t seem a good moment to try—what if the whole tunnel caved\nin?\nThere was another thud and another “ow!” from behind the rocks.\nThey were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets\nfor hours… Harry knew there was only one thing to do.\n“Wait there,” he called to Ron. “Wait with Lockhart. I’ll go on… If\nI’m not back in an hour…”\nThere was a very pregnant pause.\n“I’ll try and shift some of this rock,” said Ron, who seemed to be\ntrying to keep his voice steady. “So you can—can get back through. And,\nHarry—”\n“See you in a bit,” said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his\nshaking voice.\nAnd he set off alone past the giant snake skin.\nSoon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The\ntunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry’s body was tingling\nunpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he’d find when\nit did.

And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid\nwall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with\ngreat, glinting emeralds.\nHarry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend\nthese stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive.\nHe could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the\nemerald eyes seemed to flicker.\n“Open,” said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.\nThe serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly\nout of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.\nC\nHAPTER 17\nT H S\nHE EIR OF LYTHERIN\nHe was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering\nstone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling\nlost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish\ngloom that filled the place.\nHis heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence.\nCould the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And\nwhere was Ginny?\nHe pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine\ncolumns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He\nkept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of\nmovement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be\nfollowing him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he\nsaw one stir.\nThen, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the\nChamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.\nHarry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was\nancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the\nbottom of the wizard’s sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet\nstood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a\nsmall, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair.\n“Ginny!” Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees.\n“Ginny—don’t be dead—please don’t be dead—” He flung his wand aside,\ngrabbed Ginny’s shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was white as\nmarble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn’t Petrified. But\nthen she must be—\n“Ginny, please wake up,” Harry muttered desperately, shaking her.\nGinny’s head lolled hopelessly from side to side.\n“She won’t wake,” said a soft voice.\nHarry jumped and spun around on his knees.\nA tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar,\nwatching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were\nlooking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him—\n“Tom—Tom Riddle?”\nRiddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry’s face.\n“What d’you mean, she won’t wake?” Harry said desperately. “She’s\nnot—she’s not—?”\n“She’s still alive,” said Riddle. “But only just.”"

Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago,\nyet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older\nthan sixteen.\n“Are you a ghost?” Harry said uncertainly.\n“A memory,” said Riddle quietly. “Preserved in a diary for fifty years.”\nHe pointed toward the floor near the statue’s giant toes. Lying open\nthere was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle’s\nbathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there—but there\nwere more pressing matters to deal with.\n“You’ve got to help me, Tom,” Harry said, raising Ginny’s head again.\n“We’ve got to get her out of here. There’s a basilisk… I don’t know where\nit is, but it could be along any moment… Please, help me—”\nRiddle didn’t move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off\nthe floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.\nBut his wand had gone.\n“Did you see—?”\nHe looked up. Riddle was still watching him—twirling Harry’s wand\nbetween his long fingers.\n“Thanks,” said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.\nA smile curled the corners of Riddle’s mouth. He continued to stare at\nHarry, twirling the wand idly.\n“Listen,” said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny’s dead\nweight. “We’ve got to go! If the basilisk comes—”\n“It won’t come until it is called,” said Riddle calmly.\nHarry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any\nlonger.\n“What d’you mean?” he said. “Look, give me my wand, I might need\nit—”\nRiddle’s smile broadened.\n“You won’t be needing it,” he said.\nHarry stared at him.\n“What d’you mean, I won’t be—?”\n“I’ve waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,” said Riddle. “For the\nchance to see you. To speak to you.”\n“Look,” said Harry, losing patience, “I don’t think you get it. We’re in\nthe Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later—”\n“We’re going to talk now,” said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he\npocketed Harry’s wand.\nHarry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here…\n“How did Ginny get like this?” he asked slowly.\n“Well, that’s an interesting question,” said Riddle pleasantly. “And\nquite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley’s like this is\nbecause she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible\nstranger.”\n“What are you talking about?” said Harry.\n“The diary,” said Riddle. “My diary. Little Ginny’s been writing in it\nfor months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes—how\nher brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand\nrobes and books, how”—Riddle’s eyes glinted—“how she didn’t think\nfamous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her…”"

There was\nan almost hungry look in them.\n“It’s very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an\neleven-year-old girl,” he went on. “But I was patient. I wrote back. I was\nsympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one’s ever understood\nme like you, Tom… I’m so glad I’ve got this diary to confide in… It’s like\nhaving a friend I can carry around in my pocket…”\nRiddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn’t suit him. It made the\nhairs stand up on the back of Harry’s neck.\n“If I say it myself, Harry, I’ve always been able to charm the people I\nneeded. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be\nexactly what I wanted… I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her\ndeepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than\nlittle Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of\nmy secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her…”\n“What d’you mean?” said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.\n“Haven’t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?” said Riddle softly. “Ginny\nWeasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters\nand daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of\nSlytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib’s cat.”\n“No,” Harry whispered.\n“Yes,” said Riddle, calmly. “Of course, she didn’t know what she was\ndoing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new\ndiary entries… far more interesting, they became… Dear Tom,” he recited,\nwatching Harry’s horrified face, “I think I’m losing my memory. There are\nrooster feathers all over my robes and I don’t know how they got there.\nDear Tom, I can’t remember what I did on the night of Halloween, but a cat\nwas attacked and I’ve got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps\ntelling me I’m pale and I’m not myself. I think he suspects me… There was\nanother attack today and I don’t know where I was. Tom, what am I going to\ndo? I think I’m going mad… I think I’m the one attacking everyone, Tom!”\nHarry’s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his palms.\n“It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her\ndiary,” said Riddle. “But she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose\nof it. And that’s where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I couldn’t have\nbeen more delighted. Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was\nyou, the very person I was most anxious to meet…”\n“And why did you want to meet me?” said Harry. Anger was coursing\nthrough him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.\n“Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,” said Riddle."

So I decided to show\nyou my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust—”\n“Hagrid’s my friend,” said Harry, his voice now shaking. “And you\nframed him, didn’t you? I thought you made a mistake, but—”\nRiddle laughed his high laugh again.\n“It was my word against Hagrid’s, Harry. Well, you can imagine how it\nlooked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but\nbrilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student… on the\nother hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week, trying to\nraise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to\nwrestle trolls… but I admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked.\nI thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn’t possibly be the Heir of\nSlytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could\nabout the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance… as though\nHagrid had the brains, or the power!\n“Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think\nHagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as\ngamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed… Dumbledore\nnever seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did…”\n“I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,” said Harry, his teeth\ngritted.\n“Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid\nwas expelled,” said Riddle carelessly. “I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open\nthe Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn’t going to waste\nthose long years I’d spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary,\npreserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I\nwould be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin’s\nnoble work.”\n“Well, you haven’t finished it,” said Harry triumphantly. “No one’s\ndied this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will\nbe ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again—”\n“Haven’t I already told you,” said Riddle quietly, “that killing\nMudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new\ntarget has been—you.”\nHarry stared at him.\n“Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened, it\nwas Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you with the diary,\nyou see, and panicked. What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated\nall her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who’d been\nstrangling roosters?

But there\nisn’t much life left in her… She put too much into the diary, into me.\nEnough to let me leave its pages at last… I have been waiting for you to\nappear since we arrived here. I knew you’d come. I have many questions\nfor you, Harry Potter.”\n“Like what?” Harry spat, fists still clenched.\n“Well,” said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, “how is it that you—a skinny\nboy with no extraordinary magical talent—managed to defeat the greatest\nwizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord\nVoldemort’s powers were destroyed?”\nThere was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.\n“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Voldemort was\nafter your time…”\n“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry\nPotter…”\nHe pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through\nthe air, writing three shimmering words:\nTOM MARVOLO RIDDLE\nThen he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged\nthemselves:\nI AM LORD VOLDEMORT\n“You see?” he whispered. “It was a name I was already using at\nHogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was\ngoing to use my filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in whose veins runs\nthe blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother’s side?

No, Harry—I\nfashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would\none day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the\nworld!”\nHarry’s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at\nthe orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own parents, and so\nmany others… At last he forced himself to speak.\n“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.\n“Not what?” snapped Riddle.\n“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing fast.\n“Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is\nAlbus Dumbledore.

He was\nspeaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than believing\nit to be true—\nRiddle opened his mouth, but froze.\nMusic was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to stare\ndown the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was eerie,\nspine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry’s scalp and made his\nheart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size. Then, as the\nmusic reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs,\nflames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.\nA crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music\nto the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock’s\nand gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle.\nA second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the\nragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder.\nAs it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, sharp\ngolden beak and a beady black eye.\nThe bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry’s cheek,\ngazing steadily at Riddle.\n“That’s a phoenix…” said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it.\n“Fawkes?” Harry breathed, and he felt the bird’s golden claws squeeze\nhis shoulder gently.\n“And that—” said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes\nhad dropped, “that’s the old school Sorting Hat—”\nSo it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry’s\nfeet.\nRiddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark\nChamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once—\n“This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old\nhat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?”\nHarry didn’t answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the Sorting\nHat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for Riddle to stop\nlaughing with his courage mounting.\n“To business, Harry,” said Riddle, still smiling broadly. “Twice—in\nyour past, in my future—we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How\ndid you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,” he added softly,\n“the longer you stay alive.”\nHarry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand.\nHe, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be\nmuch good in a duel. It looked bad, all right… but the longer Riddle stood\nthere, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny… and in the meantime,\nHarry noticed suddenly, Riddle’s outline was becoming clearer, more\nsolid… If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than\nlater.\n“No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,”"

Then he forced it into an awful smile.\n“So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that’s a powerful counter-\ncharm. I can see now… there is nothing special about you, after all. I\nwondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even\nyou must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles.\nProbably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great\nSlytherin himself. We even look something alike… but after all, it was\nmerely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That’s all I wanted to\nknow.”\nHarry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle’s\ntwisted smile was widening again.\n“Now, Harry, I’m going to teach you a little lesson. Let’s match the\npowers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry\nPotter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him…”\nHe cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked\naway. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Riddle stop between\nthe high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above him\nin the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed—but Harry\nunderstood what he was saying…\n“Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four.”\nHarry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his\nshoulder.\nSlytherin’s gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw\nhis mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.\nAnd something was stirring inside the statue’s mouth. Something was\nslithering up from its depths.\nHarry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut\nhis eyes tight he felt Fawkes’ wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry\nwanted to shout, “Don’t leave me!” but what chance did a phoenix have\nagainst the king of serpents?\nSomething huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it\nshudder—he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see\nthe giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin’s mouth. Then he heard\nRiddle’s hissing voice:\n“Kill him.”\nThe basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body\nslithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began\nto run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way—\nVoldemort was laughing—"

Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began\nto run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way—\nVoldemort was laughing—\nHarry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood—the\nserpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming—\nThere was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then\nsomething heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall.\nWaiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing,\nsomething thrashing wildly off the pillars—\nHe couldn’t help it—he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what\nwas going on.\nThe enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk,\nhad raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving\ndrunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if\nit turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.\nFawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping\nfuriously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers—\nFawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden\nshower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake’s tail thrashed, narrowly\nmissing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned—Harry\nlooked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous\nyellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to\nthe floor, and the snake was spitting in agony.\n“NO!” Harry heard Riddle screaming. “LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE\nTHE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU! YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM!\nKILL HIM!”\nThe blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was\ncircling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its scaly\nnose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes.\n“Help me, help me,” Harry muttered wildly, “someone—anyone—”\nThe snake’s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked.\nSomething soft hit his face.\nThe basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry’s arms. Harry seized\nit. It was all he had left, his only chance—he rammed it onto his head and\nthrew himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk’s tail swung over him again.\nHelp me—help me—Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the\nhat. Please help me—\nThere was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though\nan invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.\nSomething very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry’s head,\nalmost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the\ntop of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it.\nA gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle\nglittering with rubies the size of eggs.\n“KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU!\nSNIFF—SMELL HIM!”\nHarry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk’s head was falling, its body\ncoiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him.

He could see the\nvast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to\nswallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin, glittering,\nvenomous—\nIt lunged blindly—Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged\nagain, and its forked tongue lashed Harry’s side. He raised the sword in\nboth his hands—\nThe basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true—Harry threw\nhis whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of\nthe serpent’s mouth—\nBut as warm blood drenched Harry’s arms, he felt a searing pain just\nabove his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper\ninto his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell,\ntwitching, to the floor.\nHarry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading\npoison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it was\ntoo late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound.\nEven as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes,\nhis vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color.\nA patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws\nbeside him.\n“Fawkes,” said Harry thickly. “You were fantastic, Fawkes…” He felt\nthe bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent’s fang had\npierced him.\nHe could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in\nfront of him.\n“You’re dead, Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s voice above him. “Dead.\nEven Dumbledore’s bird knows it. Do you see what he’s doing, Potter? He’s\ncrying.”\nHarry blinked. Fawkes’s head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly\ntears were trickling down the glossy feathers.\n“I’m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time.\nI’m in no hurry.”\nHarry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.\n“So ends the famous Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s distant voice. “Alone\nin the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the\nDark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You’ll be back with your dear\nMudblood mother soon, Harry… She bought you twelve years of borrowed\ntime… but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must…”\nIf this is dying, thought Harry, it’s not so bad.\nEven the pain was leaving him…\nBut was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be\ncoming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was\nFawkes, still resting his head on Harry’s arm. A pearly patch of tears was\nshining all around the wound—except that there was no wound—\n“Get away, bird,” said Riddle’s voice suddenly. “Get away from him—\nI said, get away—”\nHarry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry’s wand at Fawkes;\nthere was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold\nand scarlet."

In fact, I\nprefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter… you and me…”\nHe raised the wand—\nThen, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and\nsomething fell into Harry’s lap—the diary.\nFor a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it.\nThen, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do\nit all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and\nplunged it straight into the heart of the book.\nThere was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the\ndiary in torrents, streaming over Harry’s hands, flooding the floor. Riddle\nwas writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then—\nHe had gone. Harry’s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was\nsilence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the\ndiary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it.\nShaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as\nthough he’d just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered\ntogether his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the\nglittering sword from the roof of the basilisk’s mouth.\nThen came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was\nstirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused eyes traveled\nfrom the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked\nrobes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and\ntears began to pour down her face.\n“Harry—oh, Harry—I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn’t\nsay it in front of Percy—it was me, Harry—but I—I s-swear I d-didn’t mean\nto—R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over—and—how did you kill that—\nthat thing? W-where’s Riddle? The last thing I r-remember is him coming\nout of the diary—”\n“It’s all right,” said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the\nfang hole, “Riddle’s finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C’mon, Ginny,\nlet’s get out of here—”\n“I’m going to be expelled!” Ginny wept as Harry helped her\nawkwardly to her feet. “I’ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever\nsince B-Bill came and n-now I’ll have to leave and—w-what’ll Mum and\nDad say?”\nFawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance.\nHarry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the\ndead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. Harry\nheard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss."

Harry\nheard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.\nAfter a few minutes’ progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of\nslowly shifting rock reached Harry’s ears.\n“Ron!” Harry yelled, speeding up. “Ginny’s okay! I’ve got her!”\nHe heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to\nsee his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make\nin the rockfall.\n“Ginny!” Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull her\nthrough first. “You’re alive! I don’t believe it! What happened? How—what\n—where did that bird come from?”\nFawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.\n“He’s Dumbledore’s,” said Harry, squeezing through himself.\n“How come you’ve got a sword?” said Ron, gaping at the glittering\nweapon in Harry’s hand.\n“I’ll explain when we get out of here,” said Harry with a sideways\nglance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.\n“But—”\n“Later,” Harry said shortly. He didn’t think it was a good idea to tell\nRon yet who’d been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway.\n“Where’s Lockhart?”\n“Back there,” said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up\nthe tunnel toward the pipe. “He’s in a bad way. Come and see.”\nLed by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow\nin the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe.\nGilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself.\n“His memory’s gone,” said Ron. “The Memory Charm backfired. Hit\nhim instead of us. Hasn’t got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we\nare. I told him to come and wait here. He’s a danger to himself.”\nLockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.\n“Hello,” he said. “Odd sort of place, this, isn’t it? Do you live here?”\n“No,” said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.\nHarry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.\n“Have you thought how we’re going to get back up this?” he said to\nRon.\nRon shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry\nand was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the dark. He\nwas waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry looked uncertainly at him.\n“He looks like he wants you to grab hold…” said Ron, looking\nperplexed. “But you’re much too heavy for a bird to pull up there—”\n“Fawkes,” said Harry, “isn’t an ordinary bird.” He turned quickly to\nthe others. “We’ve got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron’s hand.\nProfessor Lockhart—”\n“He means you,” said Ron sharply to Lockhart.\n“You hold Ginny’s other hand—”\nHarry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took\nhold of the back of Harry’s robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of\nFawkes’s strangely hot tail feathers."

Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him, saying,\n“Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!” The chill air was whipping\nthrough Harry’s hair, and before he’d stopped enjoying the ride, it was over\n—all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom,\nand as Lockhart straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding\nback into place.\nMyrtle goggled at them.\n“You’re alive,” she said blankly to Harry.\n“There’s no need to sound so disappointed,” he said grimly, wiping\nflecks of blood and slime off his glasses.\n“Oh, well… I’d just been thinking… if you had died, you’d have been\nwelcome to share my toilet,” said Myrtle, blushing silver.\n“Urgh!” said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted\ncorridor outside. “Harry! I think Myrtle’s grown fond of you! You’ve got\ncompetition, Ginny!”\nBut tears were still flooding silently down Ginny’s face.\n“Where now?” said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry\npointed.\nFawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They\nstrode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside Professor\nMcGonagall’s office.\nHarry knocked and pushed the door open.\nC\nHAPTER 18\nD R\nOBBY’S EWARD\nFor a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart\nstood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry’s case)\nblood. Then there was a scream.\n“Ginny!”\nIt was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire.\nShe leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them\nflung themselves on their daughter.\nHarry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore was\nstanding by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who\nwas taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkes went\nwhooshing past Harry’s ear and settled on Dumbledore’s shoulder, just as\nHarry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasley’s tight\nembrace.\n“You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?”\n“I think we’d all like to know that,” said Professor McGonagall\nweakly.\nMrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then\nwalked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the ruby-encrusted\nsword, and what remained of Riddle’s diary.\nThen he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an hour\nhe spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the disembodied\nvoice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in\nthe pipes; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest, that\nAragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he"

But then he faltered. He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle’s\ndiary—or Ginny. She was standing with her head against Mrs. Weasley’s\nshoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks. What if\nthey expelled her? Harry thought in panic. Riddle’s diary didn’t work\nanymore… How could they prove it had been he who’d made her do it all?\nInstinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the\nfirelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.\n“What interests me most,” said Dumbledore gently, “is how Lord\nVoldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is\ncurrently in hiding in the forests of Albania.”\nRelief—warm, sweeping, glorious relief—swept over Harry.\n“W-what’s that?” said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. “You-Know-\nWho? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny’s not… Ginny hasn’t been… has she?”\n“It was this diary,” said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to\nDumbledore. “Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen…”\nDumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his\nlong, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.\n“Brilliant,” he said softly. “Of course, he was probably the most\nbrilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.” He turned around to the\nWeasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.\n“Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom\nRiddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared\nafter leaving the school… traveled far and wide… sank so deeply into the\nDark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many\ndangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord\nVoldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord\nVoldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.”\n“But, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What’s our Ginny got to do with—\nwith—him?”\n“His d-diary!” Ginny sobbed. “I’ve b-been writing in it, and he’s been\nw-writing back all year—”\n“Ginny!” said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. “Haven’t I taught you\nanything? What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think\nfor itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain. Why didn’t you show the\ndiary to me, or your mother?

I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten\nabout it—”\n“Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,”\nDumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. “This has been a terrible ordeal for\nher. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards than she have\nbeen hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.” He strode over to the door and\nopened it. “Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I\nalways find that cheers me up,” he added, twinkling kindly down at her.\n“You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake. She’s just giving out\nMandrake juice—I daresay the basilisk’s victims will be waking up any\nmoment.”\n“So Hermione’s okay!” said Ron brightly.\n“There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,” said Dumbledore.\nMrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking\ndeeply shaken.\n“You know, Minerva,” Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to\nProfessor McGonagall, “I think all this merits a good feast. Might I ask you\nto go and alert the kitchens?”\n“Right,” said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door.\n“I’ll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?”\n“Certainly,” said Dumbledore.\nShe left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What\nexactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? Surely—surely\n—they weren’t about to be punished?\n“I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if\nyou broke any more school rules,” said Dumbledore.\nRon opened his mouth in horror.\n“Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our\nwords,” Dumbledore went on, smiling. “You will both receive Special\nAwards for Services to the School and—let me see—yes, I think two\nhundred points apiece for Gryffindor.”\nRon went as brightly pink as Lockhart’s valentine flowers and closed\nhis mouth again.\n“But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this\ndangerous adventure,” Dumbledore added. “Why so modest, Gilderoy?”\nHarry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart. He\nturned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still\nwearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him, Lockhart\nlooked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to.\n“Professor Dumbledore,” Ron said quickly, “there was an accident\ndown in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart—”\n“Am I a professor?” said Lockhart in mild surprise. “Goodness. I\nexpect I was hopeless, was I?”\n“He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,” Ron\nexplained quietly to Dumbledore.\n“Dear me,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver\nmustache quivering. “Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!”"

Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.”\nHe stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee. Harry\ngrinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.\n“And so you met Tom Riddle,” said Dumbledore thoughtfully. “I\nimagine he was most interested in you…”\nSuddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out of\nhis mouth.\n“Professor Dumbledore… Riddle said I’m like him. Strange\nlikenesses, he said…”\n“Did he, now?” said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry from\nunder his thick silver eyebrows. “And what do you think, Harry?”\n“I don’t think I’m like him!” said Harry, more loudly than he’d\nintended. “I mean, I’m—I’m in Gryffindor, I’m…”\nBut he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.\n“Professor,” he started again after a moment. “The Sorting Hat told me\nI’d—I’d have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin’s\nheir for a while… because I can speak Parseltongue…”\n“You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly,\n“because Lord Voldemort—who is the last remaining descendant of Salazar\nSlytherin—can speak Parseltongue. Unless I’m much mistaken, he\ntransferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar.\nNot something he intended to do, I’m sure…”\n“Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?” Harry said, thunderstruck.\n“It certainly seems so.”\n“So I should be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into\nDumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me,\nand it—”\n“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to me,\nHarry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his\nhand-picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue—\nresourcefulness—determination—a certain disregard for rules,” he added,\nhis mustache quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in\nGryffindor. You know why that was. Think.”\n“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice,\n“because I asked not to go in Slytherin…”\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, beaming once more. “Which makes you"

Dully, Harry\nturned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the name\nengraved just below the hilt.\nGodric Gryffindor.\n“Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,”\nsaid Dumbledore simply.\nFor a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled open\none of the drawers in Professor McGonagall’s desk and took out a quill and\na bottle of ink.\n“What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep.

He had just reached for the\nhandle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back\noff the wall.\nLucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And cowering behind his\nlegs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby.\n“Good evening, Lucius,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.\nMr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the room.\nDobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak, a\nlook of abject terror on his face.\nThe elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to\nfinish cleaning Mr. Malfoy’s shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out in a\ngreat hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his usually sleek\nhair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around his\nankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon Dumbledore.\n“So!” he said “You’ve come back. The governors suspended you, but\nyou still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.”\n“Well, you see, Lucius,” said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, “the other\neleven governors contacted me today. It was something like being caught in\na hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They’d heard that Arthur Weasley’s\ndaughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once. They seemed to\nthink I was the best man for the job after all. Very strange tales they told\nme, too… Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse\ntheir families if they didn’t agree to suspend me in the first place.”\nMr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of\nfury.\n“So—have you stopped the attacks yet?” he sneered. “Have you\ncaught the culprit?”"

By means of this\ndiary.”\nHe held up the small black book with the large hole through the center,\nwatching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching Dobby.\nThe elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixed\nmeaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr. Malfoy,\nand then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist.\n“I see…” said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.\n“A clever plan,” said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr.\nMalfoy straight in the eye. “Because if Harry here”—Mr. Malfoy shot\nHarry a swift, sharp look—“and his friend Ron hadn’t discovered this book,\nwhy—Ginny Weasley might have taken all the blame. No one would ever\nhave been able to prove she hadn’t acted of her own free will…”\nMr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike.\n“And imagine,” Dumbledore went on, “what might have happened\nthen… The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families.\nImagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his\nown daughter was discovered attacking and killing Muggle-borns… Very\nfortunate the diary was discovered, and Riddle’s memories wiped from it.\nWho knows what the consequences might have been otherwise…”\nMr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.\n“Very fortunate,” he said stiffly.\nAnd still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary, then\nto Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head.\nAnd Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby\nbacked into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.\n“Don’t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr.\nMalfoy?” said Harry.\nLucius Malfoy rounded on him.\n“How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?” he said.\n“Because you gave it to her,” said Harry. “In Flourish and Blotts. You\npicked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it, didn’t\nyou?”\nHe saw Mr. Malfoy’s white hands clench and unclench.\n“Prove it,” he hissed.\n“Oh, no one will be able to do that,” said Dumbledore, smiling at\nHarry. “Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book. On the other\nhand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord\nVoldemort’s old school things. If any more of them find their way into\ninnocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are\ntraced back to you…”\nLucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his right\nhand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead, he\nturned to his house-elf.\n“We’re going, Dobby!”"

Instead, he\nturned to his house-elf.\n“We’re going, Dobby!”\nHe wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him, he\nkicked him right through it. They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all\nthe way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard. Then\nit came to him—\n“Professor Dumbledore,” he said hurriedly. “Can I give that diary back\nto Mr. Malfoy, please?”\n“Certainly, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly. “But hurry. The feast,\nremember…”\nHarry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could hear\nDobby’s squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly, wondering if\nthis plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes, pulled off his\nslimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it. Then he ran down the dark\ncorridor.\nHe caught up with them at the top of the stairs.\n“Mr. Malfoy,” he gasped, skidding to a halt, “I’ve got something for\nyou—”\nAnd he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy’s hand.\n“What the—?”\nMr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked\nfuriously from the ruined book to Harry.\n“You’ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days,\nHarry Potter,” he said softly. “They were meddlesome fools, too.”\nHe turned to go.\n“Come, Dobby. I said, come.”\nBut Dobby didn’t move. He was holding up Harry’s disgusting, slimy\nsock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure.\n“Master has given a sock,” said the elf in wonderment. “Master gave it\nto Dobby.”\n“What’s that?” spat Mr. Malfoy. “What did you say?”\n“Got a sock,” said Dobby in disbelief. “Master threw it, and Dobby\ncaught it, and Dobby—Dobby is free.”\nLucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged at\nHarry.\n“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!”\nBut Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry Potter!”\nThere was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He\ncrashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the\nlanding below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but\nDobby raised a long, threatening finger.\n“You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy.\n“You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.”\nLucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of\nthem, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.\n“Harry Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry,\nmoonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes. “Harry\nPotter set Dobby free!”\n“Least I could do, Dobby,” said Harry, grinning. “Just promise never to\ntry and save my life again.”\nThe elf’s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile."

Well—”\n“It was a clue, sir,” said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was\nobvious. “Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed his\nname, could be freely named, you see?”\n“Right,” said Harry weakly. “Well, I’d better go. There’s a feast, and\nmy friend Hermione should be awake by now…”\nDobby threw his arms around Harry’s middle and hugged him.\n“Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!” he sobbed.\n“Farewell, Harry Potter!”\nAnd with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.\nHarry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like\nthis. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night.\nHarry didn’t know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him,\nscreaming “You solved it! You solved it!” or Justin hurrying over from the\nHufflepuff table to wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting\nhim, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard\non the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and\nRon’s four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the\nsecond year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to tell them all\nthat the exams had been canceled as a school treat (“Oh, no!” said\nHermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor\nLockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he\nneeded to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the teachers\njoined in the cheering that greeted this news.\n“Shame,” said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. “He was\nstarting to grow on me.”\nThe rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine.\nHogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences—Defense\nAgainst the Dark Arts classes were canceled (“but we’ve had plenty of\npractice at that anyway,” Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius\nMalfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was no longer\nstrutting around the school as though he owned the place. On the contrary,\nhe looked resentful and sulky. On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was\nperfectly happy again.\nToo soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express.\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to\nthemselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they were\nallowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding Snap, set\noff the very last of Fred and George’s Filibuster fireworks, and practiced\ndisarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very good at it.\nThey were almost at King’s Cross when Harry remembered something.\n“Ginny—what did you see Percy doing, that he didn’t want you to tell\nanyone?”"

He’s been meeting her all\nover the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom\none day. He was so upset when she was—you know—attacked. You won’t\ntease him, will you?” she added anxiously.\n“Wouldn’t dream of it,” said Fred, who was looking like his birthday\nhad come early.\n“Definitely not,” said George, sniggering.\nThe Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.\nHarry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and\nHermione.\n“This is called a telephone number,” he told Ron, scribbling it twice,\ntearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. “I told your dad how\nto use a telephone last summer—he’ll know. Call me at the Dursleys’,\nokay? I can’t stand another two months with only Dudley to talk to…”\n“Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won’t they?” said\nHermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward\nthe enchanted barrier. “When they hear what you did this year?\n“Proud?” said Harry. “Are you crazy? All those times I could’ve died,\nand I didn’t manage it? They’ll be furious…”\nAnd together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle\nworld."
