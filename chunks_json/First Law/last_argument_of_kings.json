        "text": "pain stretching out through the tangled muscles between his shoulder-blades. Why\ndo I do it, when it always hurts me? Why must we test the pain? Tongue the ulcer,\nrub the blister, pick the scab?\n'Well?' he snapped.\nThe marble bust at the foot of the stairs offered only its silent contempt. And I\nget more than enough of that already. Glokta shuffled away, his useless foot\nscraping over the tiles behind him, the tapping of his cane echoing amongst the\nmouldings on the faraway ceiling.\nWhen it came to the great noblemen on the Open Council, Lord Ingelstad, the\nowner of this oversized hall, was an undersized man indeed. The head of a family\nwhose fortunes had declined with the passing years, whose wealth and influence had\nshrivelled to almost nothing. And the more shrivelled the man, the more swollen his\npretensions must become. Why do they never realise? Small things only seem\nsmaller in large spaces.\nSomewhere in the shadows a clock vomited up a few sluggish chimes. Good and\nlate already. The more shrivelled the man, the longer the wait on his pleasure. But\nI can be patient, when I must. I have no dazzling banquets, no ecstatic crowds, no\nbeautiful women waiting breathlessly for my arrival, after all. Not any more. The\nGurkish saw to that, in the darkness beneath the Emperors prisons. He pressed his\ntongue into his empty gums and grunted as he shifted his leg, needles from it\nshooting up his back and making his eyelid flicker. I can be patient. The one good\nthing about every step being an ordeal. You soon learn how to tread carefully.\nThe door beside him opened sharply and Glokta snapped his head round, doing\nhis best to hide a grimace as his neck bones crunched. Lord Ingelstad stood in the\ndoorway: a big, fatherly man with a ruddy complexion. He offered up a friendly\nsmile as he beckoned Glokta into the room. Quite as though this were a social call,\nand a welcome one at that.\n'I must apologise for keeping you waiting, Superior. I have had so many visitors\nsince I arrived in Adua, my head is in quite a spin!' Let us hope it doesn't spin right\noff. 'So very many visitors!' Visitors with offers, no doubt. Offers for your vote.\nOffers for your help in choosing our next king. But my offer, I think, you will find\npainful to refuse. 'Will you take wine, Superior?'\n'No, my Lord, thank you.' Glokta hobbled painfully over the threshold. 'I will not\nstay long. I, too, have a great deal of business to attend to.' Elections don't rig\nthemselves, you know.\n'Of course, of course. Please be seated.' Ingelstad dropped happily into one of\nhis chairs and gestured to another. It took Glokta a moment to get settled, lowering\nhimself carefully, then shifting his hips until he discovered a position in which his\nback did not give him constant pain. 'And what did you wish to discuss with me?'\n'I have come on behalf of Arch Lector Sult. I hope you will not be offended if I\nam blunt, but his Eminence wants your vote.'\nThe nobleman's heavy features twisted in feigned puzzlement. Very badly"

        "text": "'I have come on behalf of Arch Lector Sult. I hope you will not be offended if I\nam blunt, but his Eminence wants your vote.'\nThe nobleman's heavy features twisted in feigned puzzlement. Very badly\nfeigned, as it goes. 'I am not sure that I understand. My vote on what issue?'\nGlokta wiped some wet from beneath his leaking eye. Must we engage in such\nundignified dancing? You have not the build for it, and I have not the legs. 'On\nthe issue of who will next occupy the throne, Lord Ingelstad.'\n'Ah. That.' Yes, that. Idiot. 'Superior Glokta, I hope I will not disappoint you, or\nhis Eminence, a man for whom I have nothing but the highest respect,' and he bowed\nhis head with an exaggerated show of humility, 'when I say that I could not, in all\ngood conscience, allow myself to be influenced in any one direction. I feel that I,\nand all the members of the Open Council, have been given a sacred trust. I am duty\nbound to vote for the man who seems to me to be the very finest candidate, from the\nmany excellent men available.' And he assumed a grin of the greatest\nself-satisfaction.\nA fine speech. A village dunce might have even believed it. How often have I\nheard it, or its like, the past few weeks? Traditionally, the bargaining would come\nnext. The discussion of how much, exactly, a sacred trust is worth. How much\nsilver outweighs a good conscience. How much gold cuts through the bindings of\nduty. But I am not in a bargaining mood today.\nGlokta raised his eyebrows very high, 'I must congratulate you on a noble stand,\nLord Ingelstad. If everyone had your character we would be living in a better world.\nA noble stand indeed… especially when you have so much to lose. No less than\neverything, I suppose.' He winced as he took his cane in one hand and rocked\nhimself painfully forward towards the edge of the chair. 'But I see you will not be\nswayed. and so I take my leave—'\n'What can you refer to, Superior?' The nobleman's unease was written plainly\nacross his plump face.\n'Why, Lord Ingelstad, to your corrupt business dealings.'\nThe ruddy cheeks had lost much of their glow. 'There must be some mistake.'\n'Oh no, I assure you.' Glokta slid the papers of confession from the inside\npocket of his coat. 'You are mentioned often in the confessions of senior Mercers,\nyou see? Very often.' And he held the crackling pages out so they both could see\nthem. 'Here you are referred to as—and not my choice of words, you\nunderstand—an \"accomplice\". Here as the \"prime beneficiary\" of a most unsavoury\nsmuggling operation. And here, you will note—and I almost blush to mention it—\nyour name and the word \"treason\" appear in close proximity.'\nIngelstad sagged back into his chair and set his glass rattling down on the table\nbeside him, a quantity of wine sloshing out onto the polished wood. Oh, we really\nshould wipe that up. It could leave an awful stain, and some stains are impossible\nto remove."

It could leave an awful stain, and some stains are impossible\nto remove.\n'His Eminence,' continued Glokta, 'counting you as a friend, was able to keep\nyour name out of the initial enquiries, for everybody's sake. He understands that you\nwere merely trying to reverse the failing fortunes of your family, and is not without\nsympathy. If you were to disappoint him in this business of votes, however, his\nsympathy would be quickly exhausted. Do you take my meaning?' I feel that I have\nmade it abundantly clear.\n'I do,' croaked Ingelstad.\n'And the bonds of duty? Do they feel any looser, now?'\nThe nobleman swallowed, the flush quite vanished from his face. 'I am eager to\nassist his Eminence in any way possible, of course, but… the thing is—' What now?\nA desperate offer? A despairing bribe? An appeal to my conscience, even? 'A\nrepresentative of High Justice Marovia came to me yesterday. A man called Harlen\nMorrow. He made very similar representations… and not dissimilar threats.' Glokta\nfrowned. Did he now? Marovia, and his little worm. Always just one step ahead,\nor just one step behind. But never far away. A shrill note crept into Ingelstad's\nvoice. 'What am I to do? I cannot support you both! I will leave Adua, Superior, and\nnever return! I will… I will abstain from voting—'\n'You'll do no such fucking thing!' hissed Glokta. 'You'll vote the way I tell you\nand Marovia be damned!' More prodding? Distasteful, but so be it. Are my hands\nnot filthy to the elbow? Rummaging through another sewer or two will scarcely\nmake the difference. He let his voice soften to an oily purr. 'I observed your\ndaughters in the park, yesterday.' The nobleman's face lost its last vestige of colour.\n'Three young innocents on the very cusp of womanhood, dressed all in the height of\nfashion, and each one lovelier than the last. The youngest would be… fifteen?'\n'Thirteen,' croaked Ingelstad.\n'Ah.' And Glokta let his lips curl back to display his toothless smile. 'She blooms\nearly. They have never before visited Adua, am I correct?'\n'They have not,' he nearly whispered.\n'I thought not. Their excitement and delight as they toured the gardens of the\nAgriont were perfectly charming. I swear, they must have caught the eye of every\neligible suitor in the capital.' He allowed his smile slowly to fade. 'It would break my\nheart, Lord Ingelstad, to see three such delicate creatures snatched suddenly away to\none of Angland's harshest penal institutions. Places where beauty, and breeding, and\na gentle disposition, attract an entirely different and far less enjoyable kind of\nattention.' Glokta gave a carefully orchestrated shudder of dismay as he leaned\nslowly forward to whisper. 'I would not wish that life on a dog. And all on account\nof the indiscretions of a father who had the means of reparation well within his\ngrasp.'"

And all on account\nof the indiscretions of a father who had the means of reparation well within his\ngrasp.'\n'But my daughters, they were not involved—'\n'We are electing a new king! Everyone is involved!' Harsh, perhaps. But harsh\ntimes demand harsh actions. Glokta struggled to his feet, hand wobbling on his\ncane with the effort. 'I will tell his Eminence that he can count on your vote.'\nIngelstad collapsed, suddenly and completely. Like a stabbed wineskin. His\nshoulders sagged, his face hung loose with horror and hopelessness. 'But the High\nJustice…' he whispered. 'Have you no pity?'\nGlokta could only shrug. 'I did have. As a boy I was soft-hearted beyond the\npoint of foolishness. I swear, I would cry at a fly caught in a spider's web.' He\ngrimaced at a brutal spasm through his leg as he turned for the door. 'Constant pain\nhas cured me of that.'\nIt was an intimate little gathering. But the company hardly inspires warmth.\nSuperior Goyle glared at Glokta from across the huge, round table in the huge,\nround office, his beady eyes staring from his bony face. And not with tender\nfeelings, I rather think.\nThe attention of his Eminence the Arch Lector, the head of his Majesty's\nInquisition, was fixed elsewhere. Pinned to the curving wall, taking up perhaps half\nof the entire chamber, were three hundred and twenty sheets of paper. One for every\ngreat heart on our noble Open Council. They crackled gently in the breeze from the\ngreat windows. Fluttering little papers for fluttering little votes. Each one was\nmarked with a name. Lord this, Lord that, Lord someone of wherever. Big men and\nlittle men. Men whose opinions, on the whole, no one cared a damn for until\nPrince Raynault fell out of his bed and into his grave.\nMany of the pages had a blob of coloured wax on their corner. Some had two, or\neven three. Allegiances. Which way will they vote? Blue for Lord Brock, red for\nLord Isher, black for Marovia, white for Sult, and so on. All subject to change, of\ncourse, depending which way the wind blows them. Below were written lines of\nsmall, dense script. Too small for Glokta to read from where he was sitting, but he\nknew what they said. Wife was once a whore. Partial to young men. Drinks too\nmuch for his good. Murdered a servant in a rage. Gambling debts he cannot\ncover. Secrets. Rumours. Lies. The tools of this noble trade. Three hundred and\ntwenty names, and just as many sordid little stories, each one to be picked at, and\ndug out, and jabbed our way. Politics. Truly, the work of the righteous.\nSo why do I do this? Why?\nThe Arch Lector had more pressing concerns. 'Brock still leads,' he murmured in\na dour drone, staring at the shifting papers with his white gloved hands clasped\nbehind his back. 'He has some fifty votes, more or less certain.' As certain as we\ncan be in these uncertain times. 'Isher is not far behind, with forty or more to his"

Skald has made some recent gains, as far as we can tell. An unexpectedly\nruthless man. He has the Starikland delegation more or less in his hand, which gives\nhim thirty votes, perhaps, and Barezin about the same. They are the four main\ncontenders, as things stand.'\nBut who knows? Perhaps the King will live another year, and by the time it\ncomes to a vote we'll all have killed each other. Glokta had to stifle a grin at the\nthought. The Lords' Round heaped with richly-dressed corpses, every great\nnobleman in the Union and all twelve members of the Closed Council. Each stabbed\nin the back by the man beside. The ugly truth of government…\n'Did you speak to Heugen?' snapped Sult.\nGoyle tossed his balding head and sneered at Glokta with seething annoyance.\n'Lord Heugen is still struggling under the delusion that he could be our next king,\nthough he cannot certainly control more than a dozen chairs. He barely had time to\nhear our offer he was so busy scrabbling to coax out more votes. Perhaps in a week,\nor two, he will see reason. Then he might be encouraged to lean our way, but I\nwouldn't bet on it. More likely he'll throw in his lot with Isher. The two of them have\nalways been close, I understand.'\n'Good for them,' hissed Sult. 'What about Ingelstad?'\nGlokta stirred in his seat. 'I presented him with your ultimatum in very blunt\nterms, your Eminence.'\n'Then we can count on his vote?'\nHow to put this? 'I could not say so with absolute certainty. High Justice Marovia\nwas able to make threats almost identical to our own, through his man Harlen\nMorrow.'\n'Morrow? Isn't he some lickspittle of Hoffs?'\n'It would seem he has moved up in the world.' Or down, depending on how you\nlook at it.\n'He could be taken care of.' Goyle wore a most unsavoury expression. 'Quite\neasily—'\n'No!' snapped Sult. 'Why is it, Goyle, that no sooner does a problem appear than\nyou want to kill it! We must tread carefully for now, and show ourselves to be\nreasonable men, open to negotiation.' He strode to the window, the bright sunlight\nglittering purple through the great stone on his ring of office. 'Meanwhile the business\nof actually running the country is ignored. Taxes go uncollected. Crimes go\nunpunished. This bastard they call the Tanner, this demagogue, this traitor, speaks in\npublic at village fairs, urging open rebellion! Daily now, peasants leave their farms\nand turn to banditry, perpetrating untold theft and damage. Chaos spreads, and we\nhave not the resources to stamp it out. There are only two regiments of the King's\nOwn left in Adua, scarcely enough to maintain order in the city. Who knows if one\nof our noble Lords will tire of waiting and decide to try and seize the crown\nprematurely? I would not put it past them!'"

I would not put it past them!'\n'Will the army return from the North soon?' asked Goyle.\n'Unlikely. That oaf Marshal Burr has spent three months squatting outside\nDunbrec, and given Bethod ample time to regroup beyond the Whiteflow. Who\nknows when he'll finally get the job done, if ever!' Months spent destroying our own\nfortress. It almost makes one wish we'd put less effort into building the place.\n'Twenty-five votes.' The Arch Lector scowled at the crackling papers.\n'Twenty-five, and Marovia has eighteen? We're scarcely making progress! For every\nvote we gain we lose one somewhere else!'\nGoyle leaned forwards in his chair. 'Perhaps, your Eminence, the time has come\nto call again on our friend at the University—'\nThe Arch Lector hissed furiously, and Goyle snapped his mouth shut. Glokta\nlooked out the great window, pretending that he had heard nothing out of the\nordinary. The six crumbling spires of the University dominated the view. But what\nhelp could anyone possibly find there? Amongst the decay, and the dust, from\nthose old idiots of Adepti?\nSult did not give him long to consider it. 'I will speak to Heugen myself.' And he\njabbed one of the papers with a finger. 'Goyle, write to Lord Governor Meed and try\nto elicit his support. Glokta, arrange an interview with Lord Wetterlant. He has yet to\ndeclare himself one way or the other. Get out there, the pair of you.' Sult turned from\nhis sheets full of secrets and fixed on Glokta with his hard blue eyes. 'Get out there\nand get… me… votes!'\nBeing Chief\n« ^ »\n'Cold night!' shouted the Dogman. 'Thought it was meant to be summer!'\nThe three of 'em looked up. The nearest was an old man with grey hair and a face\nlooked like it had seen some weather. Just past him was a younger man, missing his\nleft arm above the elbow. The third was no more'n a boy, stood down the end of the\nquay and frowning out at the dark sea.\nDogman faked a nasty limp as he walked over, dragging one leg behind him and\nwincing like he was in pain. He shuffled under the lamp, dangling on its high pole\nwith the warning bell beside it, and held up the jar so they could all see.\nThe old man grinned, and leaned his spear against the wall. 'Always cold, down\nby the water.' He came up, rubbing his hands together. 'Just as well we got you to\nkeep us warm, eh?'\n'Aye. Good luck all round.' Dogman pulled out the stopper and let it dangle, lifted\none of the mugs and poured out a slosh.\n'No need to be shy, eh, lad?'\n'I guess there ain't at that.' Dogman sloshed out some more. The man with one\narm had to set his spear down when he got handed his mug. The boy came up last,\nand looked Dogman over, wary.\nThe old one nudged him with an elbow.

'You're old enough to hold a spear, you're old\nenough to hold a cup, I reckon.'\n'I'm old enough!' he snapped, snatching it out o' Dogman's hand, but he\nshuddered when he drank from it. Dogman remembered his first drink, feeling\nmighty sick and wondering what all the fuss was about, and he smiled to himself.\nThe boy thought he was being laughed at, most likely. 'Who are you anyway?'\nThe old boy tutted. 'Don't mind him. He's still young enough to think that\nrudeness wins respect.'\n''S alright,' said Dogman, pouring himself a mug then setting the jar down on the\nstones, taking time to think out what to say, make sure he didn't make no mistakes.\n'My name's Cregg.' He'd known a man called Cregg once, got killed in a scrap up in\nthe hills. Dogman hadn't liked him much, and he'd no idea why that name came to\nmind, but one was about as good as another right then, he reckoned. He slapped his\nthigh.

He looked out at the sea, flapping and sparkling under\nthe moon like a thing alive. 'Can't say I'm too sorry about it, though. Being honest, I\nhad a skin full o' fighting.' That last bit was no lie, at least.\n'Know how you feel,' said One-Arm, waving his stump in Dogman's face.\n'How're things up there?'\n'Alright. Union are still sat outside their own walls, trying everything to get in, and\nwe're on the other side o' the river, waiting for 'em. Been that way for weeks.'\n'I heard some boys have gone over to the Union. I heard old Threetrees was up\nthere, got killed in that battle.'\n'He was a great man, Rudd Threetrees,' said the old boy, 'great man.'\n'Aye.' Dogman nodded.

They call him Dogman 'cause he\nbit some woman's teats off one time.'\nDogman blinked. 'Do they now? Well, I never saw him.'\n'I heard the Bloody-Nine was up there,' whispered the boy, eyes big like he was\ntalking about a ghost.\nThe other two snorted at him. 'The Bloody-Nine's dead, boy, and good riddance\nto that evil fucker.' One-Arm shuddered.

That's what y'are, Dogman. You're one plausible\nbastard. I swear, you could've told 'em you was Skarling Hoodless his own self and\nthey'd have believed it. Don't know how you can keep a straight face!'\nDogman didn't feel too much like laughing. He didn't like looking at them two\ncorpses, still laid out on the stones. Kept worrying that the boy'd get cold without\nhis cloak. Damn fool thing to think about, given he was lying in a pool of his own\nblood a stride across.\n'Never mind about that,' he grunted. 'Dump these two here and get over by the\ngate. Don't know when there'll be others coming.'\n'Right y'are, chief, right y'are, whatever you say.' Dow heaved the two of them\noff into the water, then he unhooked the clapper from inside the bell and tossed that\ninto the sea for good measure.\n'Shame,' said Grim.\n'What is?'\n'Waste of a bell.'\nDow blinked at him. 'Waste of a bell, I swear! You got yourself a lot to say all of\na sudden, and you know what? I think I liked you better before. Waste of a bell?\nYou lost your mind, boy?'\nGrim shrugged. 'Southerners might want one, when they get here.'\n'They can fucking take a dive for the clapper then, can't they!' And Dow snatched\nup One-Arm's spear and strode over to the open gate, one hand stuffed inside his\nstolen cloak, grumbling to himself.

'Waste of a bell… by the fucking dead…'\nThe Dogman stretched up on his toes and unhooked the lamp, held it up, facing\nthe sea, then he lifted one side of his cloak to cover it, brought it down again. Lifted\nit up, brought it down. One more time and he hooked it flickering back on the pole.\nSeemed a tiny little flame right then, to warm all their hopes at. A tiny little flame, to\nbe seen all the way out there on the water, but the only one they had.\nHe was waiting all the time for the whole business to go wrong, for the clamour\nto go up in the town, for five dozen Carls to come pouring out that open gate and\ngive the three o' them the killing they deserved. He was bursting to piss, thinking\nabout it. But they didn't come. No sound but the empty bell creaking on its pole, the\ncold waves slapping on stone and wood. It was just the way they'd planned it.\nThe first boat came gliding out the darkness, Shivers grinning in the prow. A\nscore of Carls were pressed into the boat behind him, working the oars real careful,\nwhite faces tensed up, teeth gritted with the effort of keeping quiet. Still, every click\nand clank of wood and metal set the Dogman's nerves to jumping.\nShivers and his boys hung some sacks of straw over the side as they brought the\nboat in close, stopping the wood scraping on the stones, all thought out the week\nbefore. They tossed up ropes and Dogman and Grim caught 'em, dragged the boat\nup tight and tied it off. Dogman looked over at Dow, leaning still and easy against the\nwall by the gate, and he shook his head gently, to say no one was moving in the\ntown. Then Shivers was up the steps, smooth and quiet, squatting down in the\ndarkness.\n'Nice work, chief,' he whispered, smiling right across his face. 'Nice and neat.'\n'There'll be time to slap each others' backs later. Get the rest o' them boats tied\noff.'\n'Right y'are.' There were more boats coming now, more Carls, more sacks of\nstraw. Shivers' boys pulled them in, started dragging men up onto the quay. All\nkinds of men who'd come over the last few weeks. Men who didn't care for\nBethod's new way of doing things. Soon there was a good crowd of 'em down by\nthe water. So many Dogman could hardly believe they weren't seen.\nThey formed up into groups, just the way they'd planned, each one with their\nown chief and their own task. A couple of the lads knew Uffrith and they'd made a\nplan of the place in the dirt, the way Threetrees used to. Dogman had every one of\n'em learn it. He grinned when he thought of how much Black Dow had carped about\nthat, but it was worth it now. He squatted by the gate, and they came past, one dark\nand silent group at a time.\nTul was first up, a dozen Carls behind him. 'Alright, Thunderhead,' said Dogman,\n'you got the main gate.'\n'Aye,' nodded Tul."

And the giant hurried off into the dark streets with his crew\nbehind.\n'Red Hat, you got the tower by the well and the walls beside.'\n'That I have.'\n'Shivers, you and your boys are keeping a watch on the town square.'\n'Like the owl watches, chief.'\nAnd so on, past they went, through the gate and into the dark streets, making no\nmore noise than the wind off the sea and the waves on the dock, Dogman giving\neach crew their task and slapping 'em off on their way. Black Dow came up last, and\na hard-looking set of men he had behind him.\n'Dow, you got the headman's hall. Stack it up with some wood, like we said, but\ndon't set fire to it, you hear? Don't kill anyone you don't have to. Not yet.'\n'Not yet, fair enough.'\n'And Dow.' He turned back. 'Don't go bothering any womenfolk either.'\n'What do you think I am?' he asked, teeth gleaming in the darkness, 'Some kind\nof an animal?'\nAnd that was it done. There was just him and Grim, and a few others to watch\nthe water. 'Uh,' said Grim, nodding his head slowly. That was high praise indeed\nfrom him.\nDogman pointed over at the pole. 'Get us that bell, would you?' he said. 'Might\nhave a use for it after all.'\nBy the dead, but it made a sound. Dogman had to half close his eyes, his whole arm\ntrembling as he whacked at the bell with the handle of his knife. He didn't feel too\ncomfortable in amongst all those buildings, squashed in by walls and fences. He\nhadn't spent much time in towns in his life, and what he had spent he hadn't much\nenjoyed. Either burning things and causing mischief after a siege, or lying around in\nBethod's prisons, waiting to be killed.\nHe blinked round at the jumble of slate roofs, the walls of old grey stone, black\nwood, dirty grey render, all greasy with the thin rain. Seemed a strange way to live,\nsleeping in a box, waking all your days in the exact same spot. The idea alone made\nhim restless, as though that bell hadn't got him twitchy enough already. He cleared\nhis throat and set it down on the cobbles beside him. Then he stood there waiting,\none hand on the hilt of his sword in a way that he hoped meant business.\nSome flapping footfalls came from down a street and a little girl ran out into the\nsquare. Her jaw dropped open when she saw them standing there, a dozen men all\nbearded and armed, Tul Duru in their midst. Probably she never saw a man half so\nbig. She turned around sharp to run the other way, almost slipping over on the slick\ncobbles. Then she saw Dow sitting on a pile of wood just behind her, leaning back"

Then she saw Dow sitting on a pile of wood just behind her, leaning back\neasy against the wall, his drawn sword on his knees, and she froze stone still.\n'That's alright, girl,' growled Dow. 'You can stay where y'are.'\nThere were more of 'em coming now, hurrying down into the square from all\naround, all getting that same shocked look when they saw Dogman and his lads\nstood waiting. Women and boys, mostly, and a couple of old men. Dragged out o'\ntheir beds by the bell and still half asleep, eyes red and faces puffy, clothes tangled,\narmed with whatever was to hand. A boy with a butcher's cleaver. An old man all\nstooped over with a sword looked even older than he was. A girl at the front with a\npitch fork and a lot of messy dark hair, had a look on her face reminded Dogman of\nShari. Hard and thoughtful, the way she used to look at him before they started lying\ntogether. Dogman frowned down at her dirty bare feet, hoping that he wouldn't have\nto kill her.\nGetting 'em good and scared would be the best way to get things done quick and\neasy. So Dogman tried to talk like someone to be feared, rather than someone who\nwas shitting himself. Like Logen might've talked. Or maybe that was more fear than\nwas needful. Like Threetrees, then. Tough but fair, wanting what was best for\neveryone.\n'The headman among you?' he growled.\n'I'm him,' croaked the old man with the sword, his face all slack with shock at\nfinding a score of well-armed strangers standing in the middle of his town square.\n'Brass is my name. Who the hell might you be?'\n'I'm the Dogman, and this here is Harding Grim, and the big lad is Tul Duru\nThunderhead.' Some eyes went wide, some folk muttered to each other. Seemed\nthey'd heard the names before. 'We're here with five hundred Carls and last night we\ntook your city off you.' A few gasps and squeals at that. It was closer to two\nhundred, but there was no point telling 'em so. They might've got the notion that\nfighting was a good idea and he'd no wish to end up stabbing a woman, or getting\nstabbed by one either. 'There's plenty more of us, round about, and your guards are\nall trussed up, those we didn't have to kill. Some o' my boys, and you ought to\nknow I'm talking of Black Dow—'\n'That's me.' Dow flashed his nasty grin, and a few folk shuffled fearfully away\nfrom him like they'd been told hell itself was sat there.\n'… Well, they were for putting the torch straight to your houses and getting some\nkilling done. Do things like we used to with the Bloody-Nine in charge, you take my\nmeaning?' Some child in amongst the rest started to cry a bit, a wet kind of snuffling.\nThe boy stared round him, cleaver wobbling in his hand, the dark-haired girl blinked\nand clung on tighter to her pitch-fork.

What d'you say?'\nThe old man fingered his sword, looking like he'd rather have leant on it than\nswung it, and he stared up at the walls, where a few of the Carls were looking down,\nand his shoulders slumped. 'Looks like you got us cold. The Dogman, eh? I always\nheard you was a clever bastard. No one much left here to fight you, anyway. Bethod\ntook every man could hold a spear and a shield at once.'

'I'll see to it.'\n'Well then,' wheezed the old man, shuffling up and wincing as he knelt and\ndropped his rusty blade at Dogman's feet. 'You're a better man than Bethod, far as\nI'm concerned. I suppose I ought to be thanking you for your mercy, if you keep\nyour word.'\n'Uh.' Dogman didn't feel too merciful. He doubted the old boy he'd killed on the\ndock would be thanking him, or the one-armed man stabbed through from behind,\nor the lad with the cut throat who'd had his whole life stolen.\nOne by one the rest of the crowd came forward, and one by one the weapons, if\nyou could call 'em that, got dropped in a heap.

They were waiting for Dow and his Carls to set to hacking 'em down where\nthey stood. They were waiting to get herded in a house and locked in and the place\nset fire to. Dogman had seen all that before. So he didn't blame 'em one bit as they\nall crowded together like sheep pressed up in a field in winter. He'd have done the\nsame.\n'Alright!' he barked. 'That's it!

They\nswallowed and trembled, and muttered their thanks to the dead. They broke up,\nslowly, and spread out, and went off their own ways. Alive, to everyone's great\nrelief.\n'Nicely done, chief,' said Tul in Dogman's ear. 'Threetrees himself couldn't have\ndone it no better.'\nDow sidled up from the other side. 'About the women, though, if you're asking\nmy opinion—'\n'I'm not,' said Dogman.\n'Have you seen my son?' There was one woman who wasn't going home. She\nwas coming up from one man to another, half-tears in her eyes and her face all wild\nfrom worry. The Dogman put his head down and looked the other way. 'My son, he\nwas on guard, down by the water! You seen him?' She tugged at Dogman's coat, her\nvoice cracked and wet-sounding. 'Please, where's my son?'\n'You think I know where everyone's at?' he snapped in her weepy face.

At the far end of the bridge across it four soldiers worked by a cart,\ndragging corpses to the bank and rolling them flopping down to the bottom. The\ncorpses of the last defenders, gashed and burned, spattered with blood and dirt.\nWild men, from past the River Crinna far to the east, tangle-haired and bearded.\nTheir limp bodies seemed pitifully withered after three months sealed up behind the\nwalls of Dunbrec, pitifully starved. Scarcely human. It was hard for West to take\nmuch joy in the victory over such sorry creatures as these.\n'Seems a shame,' muttered Jalenhorm, 'after they fought so bravely. To end like\nthat.'\nWest watched another ragged corpse slither down the bank and into the tangled\nheap of muddy limbs. 'This is how most sieges end. Especially for the brave. They'll\nbe buried down there in the muck, then the moat will be flooded again. The waters of\nthe Whiteflow will surge over them, and their bravery, or lack of it, will have meant\nnothing.'\nThe fortress of Dunbrec loomed over the two officers as they crossed the bridge,\nblack outlines of walls and towers like great, stark holes in the heavy white sky.

A couple more croaked from the scarred\nbattlements.\nIt had taken General Kroy's men a month to make this same journey, bloodily\nrepulsed time and again, and to finally break through the heavy doors under a steady\nrain of arrows, stones, and boiling water. Another week of claustrophobic slaughter\nto force the dozen strides down the tunnel beyond, to burst through the second gate\nwith axe and fire and finally seize control of the outer wall. Every advantage had lain\nwith the defenders. The place had been most carefully designed to ensure that it was\nso.\nAnd once they had made it through the gatehouse, their problems were only just\nbeginning. The inner wall was twice the height and thickness of the outer, dominating\nits walkways at every point. There had been no shelter from missiles from the six\nmonstrous towers.\nTo conquer that second wall Kroy's men had tried every strategy in the manual of\nsiege. They had worked with pick and crowbar, but the masonry was five strides\nthick at the base. They had made an effort at a mine but the ground was waterlogged\noutside the fortress and solid Angland rock beneath. They had bombarded the place\nwith catapults, but scarcely scratched the mighty bastions. They had come with\nscaling ladders, again and again, in waves and in parties, by surprise at night or\nbrazenly in the day, and in the darkness and the light the straggling lines of Union\nwounded had shuffled away from their failed attempts, the dead dragged solemnly\nbehind. They had finally tried reasoning with the wild defenders, through the medium\nof a Northern translator, and the unfortunate man had been pelted with night soil.\nIt had been pure fortune, in the end. After studying the movements of the guards,\none enterprising sergeant had tried his luck with a grapple under cover of night. He\nhad climbed up and a dozen other brave men had followed him. They took the\ndefenders by surprise, killed several of them and seized the gatehouse. The whole\neffort took ten minutes and cost one Union life. It was a fitting irony, to West's\nmind, that having tried every roundabout method and been bloodily repulsed, the\nUnion army had finally entered the inner fortress by its open front gate.\nA soldier was bent over near that archway now, being noisily sick onto the\nstained flagstones. West passed him with some foreboding, the sound of his clicking\nboot heels echoing around the long tunnel, and emerged into the wide courtyard at\nthe centre of the fortress. It was a regular hexagon, echoing the shape of the inner\nand outer walls, all part of the perfectly symmetrical design. West doubted that the\narchitects would have approved, however, of the state in which the Northmen had\nleft the place.\nA long wooden building at one side of the yard, perhaps a stables, had caught\nfire in the attack and was now reduced to a mass of charred beams, the embers still\nglowing. Those clearing away the mess had too much work outside the walls, and\nthe ground was still scattered with fallen weapons and tangled corpses.

Beneath the bodies the stone flags were deeply scored,\nand not just with the random damage of a three-month siege. A great circle had been\nchiselled from the rock, and other circles within it, strange marks and symbols laid\nout in an intricate design. West did not care for its look in the least. Worse still, he\nwas becoming aware of a repulsive stench to the place, more pungent even than the\ntang of burned wood.\n'What ever is that smell?' muttered Jalenhorm, putting one hand over his mouth.\nA sergeant nearby overheard him. 'Seems that our Northern friends chose to\ndecorate the place.' He pointed up above their heads, and West followed the\ngauntleted finger with his eyes.\nThey were so decayed that it took him a moment to realise he was looking at the\nremains of men. They had been nailed, spread-eagled, to the inside walls of each of\nthe towers, high above the lean-to buildings round the courtyard. Rotting offal hung\ndown from their bellies, crawling with flies. Cut with the Bloody Cross, as the\nNorthmen would say. Tattered shreds of brightly-coloured Union uniforms were still\nvaguely visible, fluttering in the breeze among the masses of putrefying flesh.\nClearly they had been hanging there some time. Since before the siege began,\ncertainly. Perhaps since the fortress first fell to the Northmen. Corpses of the original\ndefenders, nailed there, rotting, for all those months. Three appeared to be without\ntheir heads. The companion pieces, perhaps, to those three gifts that had been sent\nto Marshal Burr all that time ago. West found himself wondering, pointlessly,\nwhether any of them had been alive when they were nailed up. Spit rushed into his\nmouth, the sound of flies buzzing seeming suddenly, sickeningly loud.\nJalenhorm had gone pale as a ghost. He did not say anything. He did not have to.\n'What happened here?' muttered West through his gritted teeth, as much to himself\nas anything.\n'Well, sir, we think they were hoping to get help.' The sergeant grinned at him,\nclearly possessed of a very strong stomach. 'Help from some unfriendly gods, we've\nbeen guessing. Seems that no one was listening down below though, eh?'\nWest frowned at the ragged markings on the ground. 'Get rid of them! Tear up\nthe flags and replace them if you have to.' His eyes strayed to the decaying cadavers\nabove, and he felt his stomach give a painful squeeze. 'And offer a ten-mark bounty\nto the man with guts enough to climb up there and cut those corpses down.'\n'Ten marks, sir? Bring me over that ladder!'\nWest turned and strode out through the open gates of the fortress of Dunbrec,\nholding his breath and hoping like hell that he never had occasion to visit the place\nagain.

The commander of\nHis Majesty's armies in Angland was as pitifully shrunken as the defenders of\nDunbrec had been, his simple uniform hanging loose around him while his pale skin\nseemed stretched too tight over the bones. In a dozen short weeks he had aged as\nmany years. His hand shook, his lip trembled, he could not stand for long, and could\nnot ride at all. From time to time he would grimace and shiver as though he was\nracked by unseen pangs. West hardly knew how he was able to carry on, but carry\non he did, fourteen hours a day and more. He attended to his duties with all his old\ndiligence. Only now they seemed to eat him up, piece by piece.\nBurr frowned grimly up at the great map of the border region, his hands resting\non his belly. The Whiteflow was a winding blue line down the middle, Dunbrec a\nblack hexagon marked in swirly script. On its left, the Union. On its right, the North.\n'So,' he croaked, then coughed and cleared his throat, 'The fortress is back in our\nhands.'\nGeneral Kroy gave a stiff nod. 'It is.'\n'Finally,' observed Poulder under his breath. The two generals still appeared to\nregard Bethod and his Northmen as a minor distraction from the real enemy; each\nother.\nKroy bristled, his staff muttering around him like a flock of angry crows.\n'Dunbrec was designed by the Union's foremost military architects, and no expense\nwas spared in its construction! Capturing it has been no mean task!'\n'Of course, of course,' growled Burr, doing his best to mount a diversion.\n'Damned difficult place to take. Do we have any notion of how the Northmen\nmanaged it?'\n'None survived to tell us what trickery they employed, sir. They fought, without\nexception, to the death. The last few barricaded themselves in the stables and set fire\nto the structure.'\nBurr glanced at West, and slowly shook his head. 'How can one understand such\nan enemy? What is the condition of the fortress now?'\n'The moat was drained, the outer gatehouse partly destroyed, considerable\ndamage done to the inner wall. The defenders tore down some buildings for wood to\nburn and stones to throw and left the rest in…' Kroy worked his lips as though\nstruggling to find the words. 'A very poor condition. Repairs will take some weeks.'\n'Huh.' Burr rubbed unhappily at his stomach. 'The Closed Council are anxious\nthat we cross the Whiteflow into the North as soon as possible, and take the fight to\nthe enemy. Positive news for the restless populace, and so on.'\n'The capture of Uffrith,' leaped in Poulder, with a grin of towering smugness, 'has\nleft our position far stronger. We have gained at a stroke one of the best ports in the\nNorth, perfectly situated to supply our forces as we push into enemy territory.\nBefore, everything had to come the length of Angland by cart, over bad roads in bad\nweather.

'Our northern allies have\nonce again proved invaluable.'\nPoulder's red-jacketed staff frowned and grumbled. 'They played a part,' the\nGeneral was forced to admit.\n'Their leader, the Dogman, came to us with the original plan, executed it himself\nusing his own men, and delivered the town to you, its gates open and its people\ncompliant.

'My men are in possession of the city and are already building up\na stockpile of supplies! We have outflanked the enemy and forced him to fall back\ntowards Carleon! That, Colonel West, is surely the issue here, and not precisely who\ndid what!'\n'Indeed!' cut in Burr, waving one big hand. 'You have both done great services\nfor your country. But we must now look forward to future successes. General Kroy,\narrange for work parties to be left behind to complete the repairs to Dunbrec, and a\nregiment of levies to man the defences. With a commander that knows his business,\nplease. It would be embarrassing, to say the least, if we were to lose the fortress for\na second time.'\n'There will be no mistake,' snarled Kroy at Poulder, 'you can depend on it.'\n'The rest of the army can cross the Whiteflow and form up on the far bank. Then\nwe can begin to press east and northward, towards Carleon, using the harbour at\nUffrith to bring in our supplies. We have driven the enemy out of Angland. Now we\nmust press forward and grind Bethod to his knees.' And the Marshal twisted a heavy\nfist into his palm by way of demonstration.\n'My division will be across the river by tomorrow evening,' hissed Poulder at\nKroy, 'and in good order!'\nBurr grimaced. 'We must move carefully, whatever the Closed Council say. The\nlast time a Union army crossed the Whiteflow was when King Casamir invaded the\nNorth. I need hardly remind you that he was forced to withdraw in some disarray.\nBethod has caught us out before, and will only grow stronger as he falls back into\nhis own territory.

The House of the Maker loomed high over all, but even that\nforbidding mass now seemed, somehow, to speak of warmth and safety.\nHe was home. He had survived. It felt like a hundred years since he had stood at\nthe stern of a not dissimilar ship, miserable and forlorn, watching Adua slide sadly\naway into the distance. Over the surging water, the snapping sailcloth, the cries of\nthe seabirds, he began to distinguish the distant rumble of the city. It sounded like\nthe most wonderful music he had ever heard. He closed his eyes and dragged the air\nin hard through his nostrils. The rotten salt tang of the bay was sweet as honey on\nhis tongue.\n'One takes it you enjoyed the trip, then, Captain?' asked Bayaz, with heavy irony.\nJezal could only grin. 'I'm enjoying the end of it.'\n'No need to be downhearted,' offered Brother Longfoot. 'Sometimes a difficult\njourney does not deliver its full benefit until long after one returns. The trials are\nbrief, but the wisdom gained lasts a lifetime!'\n'Huh.' The First of the Magi curled his lip. 'Travel brings wisdom only to the\nwise. It renders the ignorant more ignorant than ever. Master Ninefingers! Are you\ndetermined to return to the North?'\nLogen took a brief break from frowning at the water. 'I've got no reason to stay.'\nHe glanced sideways at Ferro, and she glared back.\n'Why look at me?'\nLogen shook his head. 'Do you know what? I've no fucking idea.' If there had\nbeen anything vaguely resembling a romance between them, it appeared now to have\ncollapsed irreparably into a sullen dislike.\n'Well,' said Bayaz, raising his brows, 'if you are decided.' He held his hand out to\nthe Northman and Jezal watched them shake. 'Give Bethod a kick from me, once\nyou have him under your boot.'\n'That I will, unless he gets me under his.'\n'Never easy, kicking upwards. My thanks for your help, and for your manners.\nPerhaps you will be my guest again, one day, at the library. We will look out at the\nlake, and laugh about our high adventures in the west of the World.'\n'I'll hope for it.' But Logen hardly looked as if there was much laughter in him, or\nmuch hope either. He looked like a man who had run out of choices.\nIn silence Jezal watched as the ropes were thrown down to the quay and made\nfast, the long gangplank squealed out to the shore and scraped onto the stones.\nBayaz called out to his apprentice. 'Master Quai! Time for us to disembark!' And the\npale young man followed his master down from the ship without a backward glance,\nBrother Long-foot behind them.\n'Good luck, then,' said Jezal, offering his hand to Logen.\n'And to you.' The Northman grinned, ignored the hand and folded him in a tight\nand unpleasant-smelling embrace. They stayed there for a somewhat touching,"

They stayed there for a somewhat touching,\nsomewhat embarrassing moment, then Ninefingers clapped him on the back and let\nhim go.\n'Perhaps I'll see you, up there in the North.' Jezal's voice was just the slightest bit\ncracked, in spite of all his efforts. 'If they send me…'\n'Maybe, but… I think I'll hope not. Like I said, if I was you I'd find a good\nwoman and leave the killing to those with less sense.'\n'Like you?'\n'Aye. Like me.' He looked over at Ferro. 'So that's it then, eh, Ferro?'\n'Uh.' She shrugged her scrawny shoulders, and strode off down the gangplank.\nLogen's face twitched at that. 'Right,' he muttered at her back. 'Nice knowing\nyou.' He waggled the stump of his missing finger at Jezal. 'Say one thing for Logen\nNinefingers, say he's got a touch with the women.'\n'Mmm.'\n'Aye.'\n'Right.' Jezal was finding actually leaving strangely difficult. They had been almost\nconstant companions for the last six months. To begin with he had felt nothing but\ncontempt for the man, but now that it came to it, it was like leaving a much-respected\nolder brother. Far worse, in fact, for Jezal had never thought too highly of his actual\nbrothers. So he dithered on the deck, and Logen grinned at him as though he\nguessed just what he was thinking.\n'Don't worry. I'll try to get along without you.'\nJezal managed half a smile. 'Just try to remember what I told you, if you get in\nanother fight.'\n'I'd say, unfortunately, that's pretty much a certainty.'\nThen there was really nothing Jezal could do but turn away and clatter down to\nthe shore, pretending that something had blown into his eye on the way. It seemed a\nlong walk to the busy quay, to stand next to Bayaz and Quai, Longfoot and Ferro.\n'Master Ninefingers can look after himself, I daresay,' said the First of the Magi.\n'Oh, yes indeed,' chuckled Longfoot, 'few better!'\nJezal took a last look back over his shoulder as they headed off into the city.\nLogen raised one hand to him from the rail of the ship, and then the corner of a\nwarehouse came between them, and he was gone. Ferro loitered for a moment,\nfrowning back towards the sea, her fists clenched and a muscle working on the side\nof her head. Then she turned and saw Jezal watching her.\n'What are you looking at?' And she pushed past him and followed the others, into\nthe swarming streets of Adua.\nThe city was just as Jezal remembered it, and yet everything was different. The\nbuildings seemed to have shrunk and huddled in meanly together. Even the wide\nMiddleway, the great central artery of the city, felt horribly squashed after the huge\nopen spaces of the Old Empire, the awe-inspiring vistas of ruined Aulcus. The sky"

        "text": "Middleway, the great central artery of the city, felt horribly squashed after the huge\nopen spaces of the Old Empire, the awe-inspiring vistas of ruined Aulcus. The sky\nhad been higher, out there on the great plain. Here everything was reduced, and, to\nmake matters worse, had an unpleasant smell he had never before noticed. He went\nwith his nose wrinkled, dodging between the buffeting flow of passers-by with bad\ngrace.\nIt was the people that were strangest of all. It had been months since Jezal had\nseen more than ten at one time. Now there were suddenly thousands pressed in all\naround him, furiously intent on their own doings. Soft, and scrubbed, and decked\nout in gaudy colours, as freakish to him now as circus performers. Fashions had\nmoved on while he was away facing death in the barren west of the World. Hats\nwere worn at a different angle, sleeves had swollen to a wider cut, shirt collars had\nshrivelled to a length that would have been thought preposterously short a year\nbefore. Jezal snorted to himself. It seemed bizarre that such nonsense could ever\nhave interested him, and he watched a group of perfumed dandies strutting past with\nthe highest contempt.\nTheir group dwindled as they passed on through the city. First Longfoot made\nhis effusive farewells with much pressing of hands, talk of honours and privileges,\nand promises of reunion that Jezal suspected, and indeed rather hoped, were\ninsincere. Near the great market square of the Four Corners, Quai was dispatched on\nsome errand or other with all his habitual sullen silence. That left only the First of the\nMagi as a companion, with Ferro slouching angrily along behind.\nBeing honest, Jezal would not have minded had the group dwindled considerably\nfurther. Ninefingers might have proved himself a staunch companion, but the rest of\nthe dysfunctional family would hardly have been among Jezal's chosen dinner guests.\nHe had long ago given up any hope that Ferro's armour of scowls would crack to\nreveal a caring soul within. But at least her abysmal temper was predictable. Bayaz, if\nanything, was an even more unnerving companion: one half grand-fatherly good\nhumour, the other half who knew what? Whenever the old man opened his mouth\nJezal flinched in anticipation of some ugly surprise.\nBut he chatted pleasantly enough for the time being. 'Might I ask what your plans\nare now, Captain Luthar?'\n'Well, I suppose I will be sent to Angland, to fight against the Northmen.'\n'I imagine so. Although we never know what turns fate may take.'\nJezal did not much care for the sound of that. 'And you? Will you be going back\nto…' He realised he had not the slightest idea of where the Magus had appeared\nfrom in the first place.\n'Not quite yet. I will remain in Adua for the moment. Great things are afoot, my\nboy, great things. Perhaps I will stay to see how they turn out.'\n'Move, bitch!' came a yell from the side of the road.\nThree members of the city watch had gathered round a dirty-faced girl in a\ntattered dress.

        "text": "Three members of the city watch had gathered round a dirty-faced girl in a\ntattered dress. One was leaning down over her with a stick clenched in his fist,\nshouting in her face while she cringed back. An unhappy-seeming press had gathered\nto watch, workmen and labourers mostly, scarcely cleaner than the beggar herself.\n'Why don't you let her be?' one grumbled.\nOne of the watchmen took a warning step at them, raising his stick, while his\nfriend seized hold of the beggar by her shoulder, kicking over a cup in the road,\nsending a few coins tinkling into the gutter.\n'That seems excessive,' said Jezal under his breath.\n'Well.' Bayaz watched down his nose. 'These sort of things happen all the time.\nAre you telling me you've never seen a beggar moved along before?'\nJezal had, of course, often, and never raised an eyebrow. Beggars could not\nsimply be left to clutter up the streets, after all. And yet for some reason the process\nwas making him uncomfortable. The unfortunate waif kicked and cried, and the\nguardsman dragged her another stride on her back with entirely unnecessary\nviolence, clearly enjoying himself. It was not so much the act itself that Jezal\nobjected to, as that they would do it in front of him without a thought for his\nfeelings. It rendered him somehow complicit.\n'That is a disgrace,' he hissed through gritted teeth.\nBayaz shrugged. 'If it bothers you that much, why not do something about it?'\nThe watchman chose that moment to seize the girl by her scruffy hair and give\nher a sharp blow with his stick, and she squealed and fell, her arms over her head.\nJezal felt his face twist. In a moment he had shoved through the crowd and dealt the\nman a resounding boot to his backside, sending him sprawling in the gutter. One of\nhis companions came forward with his stick out, but stumbled back a moment later.\nJezal realised he had his steels drawn, the polished blades glinting in the shadows\nbeside the building.\nThe audience gasped and edged back. Jezal blinked. He had not intended the\nbusiness to go anything like this far. Damn Bayaz and his idiotic advice. But there\nwas nothing for it now but to carry it through. He assumed his most fearless and\narrogant expression.\n'One step further and I'll stick you like the swine you are.' He looked from one of\nthe watchmen to the other. 'Well? Do any of you care to test me?' He earnestly\nhoped that none of them did, but he need not have worried. They were predictably\ncowardly in the face of determined resistance, and loitered just out of range of his\nsteels.\n'No one deals with the watch like that. We'll find you, you can depend on—'\n'Finding me will present no difficulty. My name is Captain Luthar, of the King's\nOwn. I am resident in the Agriont. You cannot miss it. It is the fortress that\ndominates the city!' And he jabbed up the street with his long steel, making one of\nthe watchmen stumble away in fear.

'I will receive you at your convenience and you\ncan explain to my patron, Lord Marshal Varuz, your disgraceful behaviour towards\nthis woman, a citizen of the Union guilty of no greater crime than being poor!'\nA ludicrously overblown speech, of course. Jezal found himself almost flushing\nwith embarrassment at that last part. He had always despised poor people, and he\nwas far from sure his opinions had fundamentally changed, but he got carried away\nhalfway through and had no choice but to finish with a flourish.\nStill, his words had their effect on the city watch. The three men backed away,\nfor some reason grinning as if the whole business had gone just as they planned,\nleaving Jezal to the unwanted approval of the crowd.\n'Well done, lad!'\n'Good thing someone's got some guts.'\n'What did he say his name was?'\n'Captain Luthar!' roared Bayaz suddenly, causing Jezal to jerk round halfway\nthrough sheathing his steels. 'Captain Jezal dan Luthar, the winner of last year's\nContest, just now returned from his adventures in the west! Luthar, the name!'\n'Luthar, did he say?'\n'The one who won the Contest?'\n'That's him! I saw him beat Gorst!'\nThe whole crowd were staring, wide-eyed and respectful. One of them reached\nout, as though to touch the hem of his coat, and Jezal stumbled backwards, almost\ntripping over the beggar-girl who had been the cause of the whole fiasco.\n'Thank you,' she gushed, in an ugly commoner's accent rendered still less\nappealing by her bloody mouth. 'Oh, thank you, sir.'\n'It was nothing.' Jezal edged away, deeply uncomfortable. She was extremely\ndirty, at close quarters, and he had no wish to contract an illness. The attention of\nthe group as a whole was, in fact, anything but pleasant. He continued to shuffle\nbackwards while they watched him, all smiles and admiring mutterings.\nFerro was frowning at him as they moved away from the Four Corners. 'Is there\nsomething?' he snapped.\nShe shrugged. 'You're not as much of a coward as you were.'\n'My thanks for that epic praise.' He rounded on Bayaz. 'What the hell was that?'\n'That was you carrying out a charitable act, my boy, and I was proud to see it. It\nwould seem my lessons have not been entirely wasted on you.'\n'I meant,' growled Jezal, who felt himself to have gained less than nothing from\nBayaz' constant lecturing, 'what were you about, proclaiming my name to all and\nsundry? The story will now spread all over town!'\n'I had not considered that.' The Magus gave a faint smile. 'I simply felt that you\ndeserved the credit for your noble actions. Helping those less fortunate, the aid of a\nlady in distress, protecting the weak and so forth. Admirable, truly.'\n'But—' muttered Jezal, unsure whether he was being taken for a fool.\n'Here our paths diverge, my young friend.'\n'Oh. They do?'\n'Where are you going?' snapped Ferro suspiciously.\n'I have a few matters to attend to,' said the Magus, 'and you will be coming with"

She appeared to be in a worse mood even than usual\nsince they left the docks, which was no mean achievement.\nBayaz' eyes rolled to the sky. 'Because you lack the social graces necessary to\nfunction for longer than five minutes on your own in such a place as this. Why else?\nYou will be going back to the Agriont, I assume?' he asked Jezal.\n'Yes. Yes, of course.'\n'Well, then. I would like to thank you, Captain Luthar, for the part you played in\nthat little adventure of ours.'\n'How dare you, you magical arsehole? The entire business was a colossal,\npainful, disfiguring waste of my time, and a failure to boot.' But what Jezal really said\nwas, 'Of course, yes.' He took the old man's hand, preparing to give it a limp shake.\n'It has been an honour.'\nBayaz' grip was shockingly firm. 'That is good to hear.' Jezal found himself\ndrawn very close to the old man's face, staring into his glittering green eyes at\nunnervingly close quarters. 'We may have the need to collaborate again.'\nJezal blinked. Collaborate really was an ugly choice of word. 'Well then… er…\nperhaps I will… see you later?' Never would have been preferable, in his opinion.\nBut Bayaz only grinned as he let go of Jezal's buzzing fingers. 'Oh, I feel sure we\nshall meet again.'\nThe sun shone pleasantly through the branches of the aromatic cedar, casting a\ndappled shade on the ground beneath, just as it used to. A pleasant breeze fluttered\nthrough the courtyard and the birds twittered in the branches of the trees, just as they\nalways had. The old buildings of the barracks had not changed, crowding in, coated\nwith rustling ivy on all sides of the narrow courtyard. But there the similarity to\nJezal's happy memories ended. A dusting of moss had crept up the legs of the\nchairs, the surface of the table had acquired a thick crust of bird droppings, the\ngrass had gone undipped for weeks on end and seed-heads thrashed at Jezal's calves\nas he wandered past.\nThe players themselves were long gone. He watched the shadows shifting on the\ngrey wood, remembering the sound of their laughter, the taste of smoke and strong\nspirits, the feel of the cards in his hand. Here Jalenhorm had sat, playing at being\ntough and manly. Here Kaspa had laughed at jokes at his own expense. Here West\nhad leaned back and shaken his head with resigned disapproval. Here Brint had\nshuffled nervously at his hand, hoping for big wins that never came.\nAnd here had been Jezal's place. He dragged the chair out from the clutching\ngrass, sat down in it with one boot up on the table and rocked it onto its rear legs. It\nseemed hard to believe, now, that he had sat here, watching and scheming, thinking\nabout how best to make his friends seem small. He told himself he would never have"

He told himself he would never have\nengaged in any such foolishness now. No more than a couple of hands, anyway.\nIf he had thought that a thorough wash, a careful shave, a plucking of bristles and\na long-winded arranging of hair would make him feel at home, he was disappointed.\nThe familiar routines left him feeling like a stranger in his own dusty rooms. It was\nhard to become excited over the shining of the boots and buttons, or the\narrangement of the gold braid just so.\nWhen he finally stood before the mirror, where long ago he had whiled away so\nmany delightful hours, he found his reflection decidedly unnerving. A lean and\nweather-worn adventurer stared bright-eyed from the Visserine glass, his sandy\nbeard doing little to disguise the ugly scar down his bent jaw. His old uniforms were\nall unpleasantly tight, scratchily starched, chokingly constricted round the collar. He\nno longer felt like he belonged in them to any degree. He no longer felt like a soldier.\nHe scarcely even knew who he should report to, after all this time away. Every\nofficer he was aware of, more or less, was with the army in Angland. He supposed\nhe could have sought out Lord Marshal Varuz, had he really wanted to, but the fact\nwas he had learned enough about danger now to not want to rush at it. He would do\nhis duty, if he was asked. But it would have to find him first.\nIn the meantime, he had other business to attend to. The very thought made him\nterrified and thrilled at once, and he pushed a finger inside his collar and tugged at it\nin an effort to relieve the pressure in his throat. It did not work. Still, as Logen\nNinefingers had been so very fond of saying: it was better to do it, than to live with\nthe fear of it. He picked up his dress sword, but after a minute of staring at the\nabsurd brass scrollwork on the hilt, he tossed it on the floor and kicked it under his\nbed. Look less than you are, Logen would have said. He retrieved his travel-worn\nlong steel and slid it through the clasp on his belt, took a deep breath, and walked to\nthe door.\nThere was nothing intimidating about the street. It was a quiet part of town, far off\nfrom chattering commerce and rumbling industry. In the next road a knife sharpener\nwas throatily proclaiming his trade. Under the eaves of the modest houses a pigeon\ncoo-cooed halfheartedly. Somewhere nearby the sound of clopping hooves and\ncrackling carriage-wheels rose and faded. Otherwise all was quiet.\nHe had already walked past the house once in each direction, and dared not do\nso again for fear that Ardee would see him through a window, recognise him, and\nwonder what the hell he was up to. So he made circuits of the upper part of the\nstreet, practising what he would say when she appeared at the door.\n'I am returned.' No, no, too high-blown. 'Hello, how are you?' No, too casual.\n'It's me, Luthar.' Too stiff. 'Ardee… I've missed you.' Too needy. He saw a man"

He saw a man\nfrowning at him from an upstairs window, and he coughed and made off quickly\ntowards the house, murmuring to himself over and over. 'Better to do it, better to do\nit, better to do it…'\nHis fist pounded against the wood. He stood and waited, heart thumping in his\nteeth. The latch clicked and Jezal put on his most ingratiating smile. The door\nopened and a short, round-faced and highly unattractive girl stared at him from the\ndoorway. There could be no doubt, however things had changed, that she was not\nArdee. 'Yes?'\n'Er…' A servant. How could he have been such a fool as to think Ardee would\nopen her own front door? She was a commoner, not a beggar. He cleared his throat.\n'I am returned… I mean to say… does Ardee West live here?'\n'She does.' The maid opened the door far enough for Jezal to step through into\nthe dim hallway. 'Who shall I say is calling?'\n'Captain Luthar.'\nHer head snapped round as though it had an invisible string attached to it and he\nhad given it a sudden jerk. 'Captain… Jezal dan Luthar?'\n'Yes,' he muttered, mystified. Could Ardee have been discussing him with the\nhelp?\n'Oh… oh, if you wait…' The maid pointed to a doorway and hurried off, eyes\nwide, quite as if the Emperor of Gurkhul had come calling.\nThe dim living room gave the impression of having been decorated by someone\nwith too much money, too little taste, and not nearly enough space for their\nambitions. There were several garishly upholstered chairs, an over-sized and\nover-decorated cabinet, and a monumental canvas on one wall which, had it been\nany bigger, would have required the room to be knocked through into the\nneighbouring house. Two dusty shafts of light came in through the gaps in the\ncurtains, gleaming on the highly polished, if slightly wonky, surface of an antique\ntable. Each piece might have passed muster on its own, but crowded together the\neffect was quite suffocating. Still, Jezal told himself as he frowned round at it all, he\nhad come for Ardee, not for her furniture.\nIt was ridiculous. His knees were weak, his mouth was dry, his head was\nspinning, and with every moment that passed it got worse. He had not felt this\nscared in Aulcus, with a crowd of screaming Shanka bearing down on him. He took\na nervous circuit of the room, fists clenching and unclenching. He peered out into\nthe quiet street. He leaned over a chair to examine the massive painting. A\nmuscular-seeming king lounged in an outsize crown while fur-trimmed lords bowed\nand scraped around his feet. Harod the Great, Jezal guessed, but the recognition\nbrought him little joy. Bayaz' favourite and most tiresome topic of conversation had\nbeen the achievements of that man. Harod the Great could be pickled in vinegar for\nall Jezal cared. Harod the Great could go—\n'Well, well, well…'"

So often\nin life, moments that are long anticipated turn out to be profound disappointments.\nSeeing Ardee again, after all that time apart, was undoubtedly an exception. All his\ncarefully prepared conversation evaporated in that one instant, leaving him as\nempty-headed as he had been when he first laid eyes on her.\n'You're alive, then,' she murmured.\n'Yes… er… just about.' He managed half an awkward smile. 'Did you think I was\ndead?'\n'I hoped you were.' That wiped the grin off his face with sharp effect. 'When I\ndidn't get so much as a letter. But really I thought you'd just forgotten about me.'\nJezal winced. 'I'm sorry I didn't write. Very sorry.

The whole city is buzzing with it, and if I've heard, it must be\ncommon knowledge indeed.'\n'You've heard?'\nArdee jerked her head towards the hall. 'I had it from the maid.'\n'From the maid?' How the hell could anyone in Adua have heard anything about\nhis misadventures, let alone Ardee West's maid? He was assailed with sudden\nunpleasing images. Crowds of servants giggling at the thought of him lying around\ncrying over his broken face. Everyone who was anyone gossiping about what a fool\nhe must have looked being fed with a spoon by a scarred brute of a Northman. He\nfelt himself blushing to the tips of his ears. 'What did she say?'\n'Oh, you know.' She wandered absently into the room. 'That you scaled the walls\nat the siege of Darmium, was it? Opened the gates to the Emperor's men and so on.'\n'What?' He was even more baffled than before. 'Darmium? I mean to say… who\ntold her…'\nShe came closer, and closer, and he grew more and more flustered until he\nstammered to a stop. Closer yet, and she was looking slightly upwards into his face\nwith her lips parted. So close that he was sure she was going to take him in her arms\nand kiss him. So close that he leaned forward slightly in anticipation, half-closing his\neyes, his lips tingling… Then she passed him, her hair nearly flicking in his face, and\nwent on to the cabinet, opening it and taking out a decanter, leaving him behind,\nmarooned on the carpet.\nIn gormless silence he watched her fill two glasses and offer one out, wine"

'What\nbattle?'\n'The one where Prince Ladisla was killed.'\n'Ladisla's dead?' he squealed, voice shooting up into a girlish register again. The\nfew times he had seen the Crown Prince the man had seemed so self-absorbed as to\nbe indestructible. It was hard to believe he could simply be stabbed with a sword, or\nshot with an arrow, and die, like anyone else, but there it was.\n'And then his brother was murdered—'\n'Raynault? Murdered?'\n'In his bed in the palace. When the king dies, they'll choose a new one by a vote\nin Open Council.'\n'A vote?' His voice rose so high at that he almost felt some sick at the back of his\nthroat.\nShe was already filling her glass again. 'Uthman's emissary was hanged for the\nmurder, despite most likely being innocent, and so the war with the Gurkish is\ndragging on—'\n'We're at war with the Gurkish as well?'\n'Dagoska fell at the start of the year.'\n'Dagoska… fell?' Jezal emptied his glass in one long swallow and stared at the\ncarpet, trying to fit it all into his head. He should not have been surprised, of course,\nthat things had moved on while he was away, but he had hardly expected the world\nto turn upside down. War with the Gurkish, battles in the North, votes to choose a\nnew king?\n'You need another?' asked Ardee, tilting the decanter in her hand.\n'I think I'd better.' Great events, of course, just as Bayaz had said. He watched\nher pour, frowning down intently, almost angrily, as the wine gurgled out. He saw a\nlittle scar on her top lip that he had never noticed before, and he felt a sudden\ncompulsion to touch it, and push his fingers in her hair, and hold her against him.\nGreat events, but it all seemed of small importance compared to what happened"

A miserable effort which she dismissed with\na bitter snort.\n'Don't be a fool.'\nHe caught her hand, making her look him in the eye. 'I've been a fool all my life.\nNot now. There were times, out there on the plain, the only thing that kept me alive\nwas the thought that… that I might be with you again. Every day I wanted to see\nyou…' She did nothing but frown back at him, entirely unmoved. Her failure to melt\ninto his arms was highly frustrating, after all he had been through. 'Ardee, please, I\ndidn't come here to argue.'\nShe scowled at the floor as she threw down another glass. 'I don't know why you\ndid come here.'\n'Because I love you, and I want never to be separated from you again! Please, tell\nme that you will be my wife!' He almost said it, but at the last moment he saw her\nscornful sneer, and he stopped himself. He had entirely forgotten how difficult she\ncould be. 'I came here to say that I'm sorry. I let you down, I know. I came as soon\nas I could, but I see that you're not in the mood. I'll come back later.'\nHe brushed past her and made for the door but Ardee got there first, twisted the\nkey in the lock and snatched it out. 'You leave me all alone here, without so much as\na letter, then when you come back you want to leave without even a kiss?' She took\na lurching step at him and Jezal found himself backing off.\n'Ardee, you're drunk.'\nShe flicked her head with annoyance. 'I'm always drunk. Didn't you say you\nmissed me?'\n'But,' he muttered, starting for some reason to feel slightly scared, 'I thought—'\n'There's your problem, you see? Thinking. You're no good at it.' She herded him\nback against the edge of the table, and he got his sword so badly tangled up with his\nlegs he had to put a hand down to stop himself falling.\n'Haven't I been waiting?' she whispered, and her breath on his face was hot and\nsour-sweet with wine. 'Just like you asked me?' Her mouth brushed gently against\nhis, and the tip of her tongue slipped out and lapped against his lips, and she made\nsoft gurgling sounds in her throat and pressed herself up against him. He felt her\nhand slide down onto his groin, rubbing at him gently through his trousers.\nThe feeling was pleasant, of course, and caused an instant stiffening. Pleasant in\nthe extreme, but more than slightly worrying. He looked nervously towards the door.\n'What about the servants?' he croaked.\n'If they don't like it they can find another fucking job, can't they?

You came here for me, didn't\nyou?'\n'Yes… yes, of course!'\n'Say it, then!' Her hand pressed up hard against his trousers, almost painful, but\nnot quite.\n'Ah… I came for you.'\n'Well? Here I am.' And her fingers fumbled with his belt and dragged it open. 'No\nneed to be shy now.'\nHe tried to catch her wrist. 'Ardee, wait—' Her other hand caught him a stinging\nslap right across the face and knocked his head sideways, hard enough to make his\nears ring.\n'I've been sitting here for six months doing nothing' she hissed in his face, words\nslightly slurred. 'Do you know how bored I've been? And now you're telling me to\nwait? Fuck yourself!' She dug roughly into his trousers and dragged his prick out,\nrubbing at him with one hand, squeezing at his face with the other while he closed his\neyes and gasped shallow breaths into her mouth, nothing in his mind but her fingers.\nHer teeth nipped at his lip, almost painful, and then harder. 'Ah,' he grunted. 'Ah!'\nShe was decidedly biting him. Biting with a will, as though his lip were a piece of\ngristle to be chewed through. He tried to pull away but the table was at his back and\nshe had him fast. The pain was almost as great as the shock, and then, as the biting\nwent on, considerably greater.\n'Aargh!' He grabbed hold of her wrist with one hand and twisted it behind her\nback, yanked her arm and shoved her down onto the table. He heard her gasp as her\nface cracked hard against the polished wood.\nHe stood over her, frozen with dismay, his mouth salty with blood. He could see\none dark eye through Ardee's tangled hair, expressionless, watching him over her\ntwisted shoulder. The hair moved round her mouth as she breathed, fast. He let go\nof her wrist, suddenly, saw her arm move, the marks left by his fingers angry pink on\nher skin. Her hand slid down and took hold of a fistful of her dress and pulled it up,\ntook another fistful and pulled it up, until her skirts were all tangled around her waist\nand her bare, pale arse was slicking up at him.\nWell.

This was undoubtedly one of those occasions. When he had spent\nall those interminable hours out on the plain, saddle-sore and in fear of his life,\ndreaming of seeing Ardee again, a quick and violent coupling on the table in her\ntasteless living-room had not been quite what he'd had in mind. When they were\ndone he pushed his wilting prick back inside his trousers, guilty, and ashamed, and\nmiserable in the extreme. The sound of his belt-buckle clinking made him want to\nsmash his face against the wall.\nShe got up, and let her skirts drop, and smoothed them down, her face to the\nfloor. He reached for her shoulder. 'Ardee—' She shook him angrily off, and walked\naway. She tossed something on the floor behind her and it rattled on the carpet. The\nkey to the door.\n'You can go.'\n'I can what?'\n'Go! You got what you wanted, didn't you?'\nHe licked disbelieving at his bloody lip. 'You think this is what I wanted?' Nothing\nbut silence. 'I love you.'\nShe gave a kind of cough, as if she was about to be sick, and she slowly shook\nher head. 'Why?'\nHe wasn't sure he knew. He wasn't sure what he meant, or how he felt any more.\nHe wanted to start again, but he didn't know how. The whole thing was an\ninexplicable nightmare from which he hoped soon to wake. 'What do you mean,\nwhy?'\nShe bent over, fists clenched, and screamed at him. 'I'm fucking nothing!\nEveryone who knows me hates me! My own father hated me! My own brother!' Her\nvoice cracked, and her face screwed up, and her mouth spat with anger and misery.\n'Everything I touch I ruin! I'm nothing but shit! Why can't you see it?' And she put\nher hands over her face, and turned her back on him, and her shoulders shook.\nHe blinked at her, his own lip trembling. The old Jezal dan Luthar would most\nlikely have made a quick grab for that key, sprinted from the room and off down the\nstreet, never to come back, and counted himself lucky to have got away so easily.\nThe new one thought about it.\nHe thought about it hard. But he had more character than that. Or so he told\nhimself.\n'I love you.' The words tasted like lies in his bloody mouth, but he had gone far\ntoo far now to turn back. 'I still love you.' He crossed the room, and though she\ntried to push him off he put his arms around her. 'Nothing's changed.' He pushed his\nfingers into her hair, and held her head against his chest while she cried softly,\nsobbing snot down the front of his garish uniform.\n'Nothing's changed,' he whispered.

It was early morning, and although the sun cast a stinging glare in\nGlokta's eyes and lent the dewy grass, the rustling trees, the shifting water in the park\na golden glow, there was still a treacherous nip to the air. Lord Wetterlant was\nevidently an early riser. But then so am I. Nothing encourages a man to leave his\nbed like being kept awake all night by searing cramps.\nHis Lordship reached into a paper bag, drew out a pinch of bread dust between\nthumb and forefinger, and tossed it at his feet. A mob of self-important ducks had\nalready gathered, and now they fussed at each other furiously in their efforts to get at\nthe crumbs while the old nobleman watched them, his lined face a slack and\nemotionless mask.\n'I am under no illusions, Superior,' he droned, almost without moving his lips and\nwithout looking up at all. 'I am not a big enough man to compete in this contest, even\nshould I wish to. But I am big enough to get something from it. I intend to get what I\ncan.' Straight to business, then, for once. No need to talk about the weather, or\nhow the children are, or the relative merits of different-coloured ducks.\n'There is no shame in that.'\n'I do not think so. I have a family to feed, and it grows by the year. I strongly\nadvise against too many children.' Hah, That shouldn't be a problem. 'And then I\nkeep dogs, and they must be fed also, and have great appetites.' Wetterlant gave a\nlong, wheezing sigh, and tossed the birds another pinch of bread. 'The higher you\nrise, Superior, the more dependents cry at you for scraps; that is a sad fact.'\n'You carry a large responsibility, my Lord.' Glokta grimaced at a spasm in his leg,\nand cautiously stretched it out until he felt his knee click. 'How large, might I ask?'\n'I have my own vote, of course, and control the votes of three other chairs on the\nOpen Council. Families tied to my own by bonds of land, of friendship, of marriage,\nand of long tradition.' Such bonds may prove insubstantial in times such as these.\n'You are certain of those three?'\nWetterlant turned his cold eyes on Glokta. 'I am no fool, Superior. I keep my\ndogs well chained. I am certain of them. As certain as we can be of anything, in\nthese uncertain times.' He tossed more crumbs into the grass and the ducks\nquacked, and pecked, and beat at each other with their wings.\n'Four votes in total, then.' No mean share of the great pie.\n'Four votes in total.'\nGlokta cleared his throat, checked quickly that there was no one within earshot. A\ngirl with a tragic face stared listlessly into the water just down the path. Two\ndishevelled officers of the King's Own sat on a bench as far away on the other side,\nholding forth to each other loudly about who had been drunker the night before.\nMight the tragic girl be listening for Lord Brock?

Might the two officers report to\nHigh Justice Marovia? I see agents everywhere, and it is just as well. There are\nagents everywhere. He lowered his voice to a whisper. 'His Eminence would be\nwilling to offer fifteen thousand marks for each vote.'\n'I see.' Wetterlant's hooded eyes did not so much as twitch. 'So little meat would\nscarcely satisfy my dogs. It would leave nothing for my own table. I should tell you\nthat Lord Barezin, in a highly roundabout manner, already offered me eighteen\nthousand a vote, as well as an excellent stretch of land that borders my own estates.\nDeer hunting woods. Are you a hunting man, Superior?'\n'I was.' Glokta tapped his ruined leg. 'But not for some time.'\n'Ah. My commiserations. I have always loved the sport. But then Lord Brock\ncame to visit me.' How charming for you both. 'He was good enough to make an\noffer of twenty thousand, and a very suitable match of his youngest daughter for my\neldest son.'\n'You accepted?'\n'I told him it was too early to accept anything.'\n'I am sure his Eminence could stretch to twenty-one, but that would have to be—'\n'High Justice Marovia's man already offered me twenty-five.'\n'Harlen Morrow?' hissed Glokta through his remaining teeth.\nLord Wetterlant raised an eyebrow. 'I believe that was the name.'\n'I regret that I can only match that offer at present. I will inform his Eminence of\nyour position.' His delight, I am sure, will know no bounds.\n'I look forward to hearing from you, Superior.' Wetterlant turned back to his\nducks and permitted them a few more crumbs, a vague smile hovering round his lips\nas he watched them tussle with each other.\nGlokta hobbled painfully up to the ordinary house in the unexceptional street,\nsomething resembling a smile on his face. A moment free of the suffocating\ncompany of the great and the good. A moment in which I do not have to lie, or\ncheat, or watch for a knife in my back. Perhaps I'll even find a room that doesn't\nstill stink of Harlen Morrow. That would be a refreshing—\nThe door opened sharply even as he raised his fist to knock, and he was left\nstaring into the grinning face of a man wearing the uniform of an officer in the King's\nOwn. It was so unexpected that Glokta did not recognise him at first. Then he felt a\nsurge of dismay.\n'Why, Captain Luthar. What a surprise.' And a thoroughly unpleasant one.\nHe was considerably changed. Where once he had been boyish and smooth, he\nhad acquired a somewhat angular, even a weather-beaten look. Where once he had\ncarried his chin with an arrogant lift, he now had an almost apologetic tilt to his face.\nHe had grown a beard too, perhaps in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise a\nvicious-looking scar through his lip and down his jaw. Though it has far from\nrendered him ugly, alas.\n'Inquisitor Glokta… er…'\n'Superior.'"

Luthar blinked at him for a moment. 'Well… in that case…' The easy\nsmile reappeared, and Glokta was surprised to find himself being shaken warmly by\nthe hand. 'Congratulations. I would love to chat but duty calls. I haven't long in the\ncity, you see. Off to the North, and so on.'\n'Of course.' Glokta frowned after him as he stepped jauntily off up the street,\nwith just the one furtive glance over his shoulder as he rounded the corner. Leaving\nonly the question of why he was here in the first place. Glokta hobbled through the\nopen door and shut it quietly behind him. Although honestly, a young man leaving\na young woman's house in the early morning? One scarcely requires his Majesty's\nInquisition to solve that particular mystery. Did I not leave more than my share of\nresidences in the early hours, after all? Pretending to hope that I wasn't observed,\nbut really rather hoping that I was? He passed through the doorway into the living\nroom. Or was that a different man?\nArdee West stood with her back to him, and he heard the sound of wine trickling\ninto a glass. 'Did you forget something?' she asked over her shoulder, voice soft and\nplayful. Not a tone I often get to hear women use. Horror, disgust, and the slightest\ntouch of pity are more common. There was a clinking as she put the bottle away. 'Or\ndid you decide you really couldn't live without another—' She had a crooked smile\non her face as she turned, but it slid off suddenly when she saw who was standing\nthere.\nGlokta snorted. 'Don't worry, I get that reaction from everyone. Even myself,\nevery morning, when I look into the mirror.' If I can even manage to stand up in\nfront of the damn thing.\n'It's not like that, and you know it. I just wasn't expecting you to wander in.'\n'We've all had quite the shock this morning, then. You'll never guess who I\npassed in your hallway.'\nShe froze for just a moment, then tossed her head dismissively and slurped wine\nfrom her glass. 'Aren't you going to give me a clue?'\n'Alright, I will.' Glokta winced as he lowered himself into a chair, stretching his\naching leg out in front of him. 'A young officer in the King's Own, no doubt with a\nscintillating future ahead of him.' Though we can all hope otherwise.\nArdee glared at him over the rim. 'There are so many officers in the King's Own I\ncan scarcely tell one from another.'\n'Really? This one won last year's Contest, I believe.'\n'I hardly remember who was in the final. Every year is like the last, don't you\nfind?'\n'True. Since I competed it's been straight downhill. But I thought you might\nremember this particular fellow. Looked as if someone might have hit him in the face\nsince we last met. Quite hard, I would say.' Though not half as hard as I'd have\nliked."

I thought you were cleverer\nthan this.'\n'Cleverness is no guarantee of sensible behaviour. My father used to say so all the\ntime.' She finished her wine with a practised flick of her head. 'Don't worry. I can\nlook after myself.'\n'No you can't. You've made that abundantly clear. You realise what will happen if\npeople find out? You'll be shunned.'\n'What would be the difference?' she sneered at him. 'Perhaps you'll be surprised\nto learn I get few invitations to the palace now. I barely even qualify as an\nembarrassment. No one speaks to me.' Apart from me, of course, but I'm hardly the\ntype of company young women hope for. 'No one cares a shit what I do. If they find\nout it will be no worse than they expect from a slattern like me. Damn commoners,\nno more self-control than animals, don't you know. Anyway, didn't you tell me I\ncould fuck who I pleased?'\n'I also told you the less fucking the better.'\n'And I suppose that's what you told all your conquests, is it?'\nGlokta grimaced. Not exactly. I coaxed and I pleaded, I threatened and I\nbullied. Your beauty has wounded me, wounded me in the heart! I am wretched, I\nwill die without you! Have you no pity? Do you not love me? I did everything short\nof display the instruments, then when I got what I wanted I tossed them aside and\nwent merrily on to the next with never a backward glance.\n'Hah!' snorted Ardee, as though she guessed what he was thinking. 'Sand dan\nGlokta, giving lectures on the benefits of chastity? Please! How many women did\nyou ruin before the Gurkish ruined you? You were notorious!'\nA muscle began to tremble in his neck, and he worked his shoulder round until he\nfelt it soften. She makes a fair point. Perhaps a soft word with the gentleman in\nquestion will do the trick. A soft word, or a hard night with Practical Frost. 'Your\nbed, your business, I suppose, as they say in Styria. How does the great Captain\nLuthar come to be among the civilians in any case? Doesn't he have Northmen to\nrout? Who will save Angland, while he's here?'\n'He wasn't in Angland.'\n'No?' Father find him a nice, out of the way spot, did he?\n'He's been in the Old Empire, or some such. Across the sea to the west and far\naway.' She sighed as though she had heard a great deal about it and was now\nthoroughly bored of the subject.\n'Old Empire? What the hell was he up to out there?'\n'Why don't you ask him? Some journey. He talked a lot about a Northman.\nNinefingers, or something.'\nGlokta's head jerked up. 'Ninefingers?'\n'Mmm. Him and some old bald man.'"

'Nobody tells me anything.'\nSo Much in Common\n« ^ »\nFerro stalked round the room, and scowled. She poured her scorn out into the\nsweet-smelling air, onto the rustling hangings, over the great windows and the high\nbalcony beyond them. She sneered at the dark pictures of fat pale kings, at the\nshining furniture scattered about the wide floor. She hated this place, with its soft\nbeds and its soft people. She infinitely preferred the dust and thirst of the Badlands\nof Kanta. Life there was hard, and hot, and brief.\nBut at least it was honest.\nThis Union, and this city of Adua in particular, and this fortress of the Agriont\nespecially, were all packed to bursting with lies. She felt them on her skin, like an oily\nstain she could not rub off. And Bayaz was sunk in the very midst of it. He had\ntricked her into following him across the world for nothing. They had found no\nancient weapon to use against the Gurkish. Now he smiled, and laughed, and\nwhispered secrets with old men. Men who came in sweating from the heat outside,\nand left sweating even more.\nShe would never have admitted it to anyone else. She despised having to admit it\nto herself. She missed Ninefingers. Though she had never been able to show it, it\nhad been a reassurance, having someone she could halfway trust.\nNow she had to look over her own shoulder.\nAll she had for company was the apprentice, and he was worse than nothing. He\nsat and watched her in silence, his book ignored on the table beside him. Watching\nand smiling without joy, as though he knew something she should have guessed. As\nthough he thought her a fool for not seeing it. That only made her angrier than ever.\nSo she prowled round the room, frowning at everything, her fists clenched and her\njaw locked light.\n'You should go back to the South, Ferro.'\nShe stopped in her tracks, and scowled at Quai. He was right, of course. Nothing\nwould have pleased her more than to leave these Godless pinks behind forever and\nfight the Gurkish with weapons she understood. Tear vengeance from them with her\nteeth, if she had to. He was right, but that changed nothing. Ferro had never been\nmuch for taking advice. 'What do you know about what I should do, scrawny pink\nfool?'\n'More than you think.' He did not take his slow eyes away from her for a\nmoment. 'We are much alike, you and I.

I found out too late, but you still have time. You should find\nanother master.'\n'I have no master,' she snapped at him. 'I am free.'\nOne corner of Quai's pale lips twitched up. 'Neither of us will ever be free. Go.\nThere is nothing for you here.'\n'Why do you stay, then?'\n'For vengeance.'\nFerro frowned deeper. 'Vengeance for what?'\nThe apprentice leaned forward, his bright eyes fixed on hers. The door creaked\nopen and he snapped his mouth shut, sat back and looked out of the window. Just\nas if he had never meant to speak.\nDamn apprentice with his damn riddles. Ferro turned her scowl towards the door.\nBayaz came slowly through into the room, a teacup held carefully level in one\nhand. He did not so much as look in Ferro's direction as he swept past and out the\nopen door onto the balcony. Damn Magus. She stalked after, narrowing her eyes at\nthe glare. They were high up, and the Agriont was spread out before them, as it had\nbeen when she and Ninefingers climbed over the rooftops, long ago. Groups of idle\npinks lazed on the shining grass below, just as they had done before Ferro left for\nthe Old Empire. And yet not everything was the same.\nEverywhere in the city, now, there was a kind of fear. She could see it in each\nsoft, pale face. In their every word and gesture. A breathless expectation, like the air\nbefore the storm breaks. Like a field of dry grass, ready to burst into flame at the\nslightest spark. She did not know what they were waiting for, and she did not care.\nBut she had heard a lot of talk about votes.\nThe First of the Magi watched her as she stepped through the door, the bright\nsun shining on the side of his bald head. 'Tea, Ferro?'\nFerro hated tea, and Bayaz knew it. Tea was what the Gurkish drank when they\nhad treachery in mind. She remembered the soldiers drinking it while she struggled in\nthe dust. She remembered the slavers drinking it while they talked prices. She\nremembered Uthman drinking it while he chuckled at her rage and her helplessness.\nNow Bayaz drank it, little cup held daintily between his thick thumb and forefinger,\nand he smiled.\nFerro ground her teeth. 'I am done here, pink. You promised me vengeance and\nhave given me nothing. I am going back to the South.'\n'Indeed? We would be sorry to lose you. But Gurkhul and the Union are at war.\nThere are no ships sailing to Kanta at present. There may not be for some time to\ncome.'\n'Then how will I get there?'\n'You have made it abundantly clear that you are not my responsibility. I have put\na roof over your head and you show scant gratitude. If you wish to leave, you can\nmake your own arrangements. My brother Yulwei should return to us shortly."

My brother Yulwei should return to us shortly.\nPerhaps he will be prepared to take you under his wing.'\n'Not good enough.' Bayaz glared at her. A fearsome look, perhaps, but Ferro was\nnot Longfoot, or Luthar, or Quai. She had no master, and would never have another.\n'Not good enough, I said!'\n'Why is it that you insist on testing the limits of my patience? It is not without an\nend, you know.'\n'Neither is mine.'\nBayaz snorted. 'Yours scarcely even has a beginning, as Master Ninefingers\ncould no doubt testify. I do declare, Ferro, you have all the charm of a goat, and a\nmean-tempered goat at that.' He stuck his lips out, tipped up his cup and sucked\ndelicately from the rim. Only with a mighty effort was Ferro able to stop herself from\nslapping it out of his hand, and butting the bald bastard in the face into the bargain.\n'But if fighting the Gurkish is still what you have in mind—'\n'Always.'\n'Then I am sure that I can still find a use for your talents. Something that does not\nrequire a sense of humour. My purposes with regard to the Gurkish are unchanged.\nThe struggle must continue, albeit with other weapons.' His eyes slid sideways,\ntowards the great tower that loomed up over the fortress.\nFerro knew little about beauty and cared still less, but that building was a beautiful\nthing to her mind. There was no softness, no indulgence in that mountain of naked\nstone. There was a brutal honesty in its shape. A merciless precision in its sharp,\nblack angles. Something about it fascinated her.\n'What is that place?' she asked.\nBayaz narrowed his eyes at her. 'The House of the Maker.'\n'What is inside?'\n'None of your business.'\nFerro almost spat with annoyance. 'You lived there. You served Kanedias. You\nhelped the Maker with his works. You told us all this, out on the plains. So tell me,\nwhat is inside?'\n'You have a sharp memory, Ferro, but you forget one thing. We did not find the\nSeed. I do not need you. I do not need, in particular, to answer your endless\nquestions any longer. Imagine my dismay.' He sucked primly at his tea again, raising\nhis brows and peering out at the lazy pinks in the park.\nFerro forced a smile onto her own face. Or as close as she could get to a smile.\nShe bared her teeth, at least. She remembered well enough what the bitter old woman\nCawneil had said, and how much it had annoyed him. She would do the same. 'The\nMaker. You tried to steal his secrets. You tried to steal his daughter. Tolomei was\nher name. Her father threw her from the roof. In return for her betrayal, in opening\nhis gates to you. Am I wrong?'\nBayaz angrily flicked the last drops from his cup over the balcony. Ferro watched\nthem glitter in the bright sun, tumbling downwards. 'Yes, Ferro, the Maker threw his\ndaughter from the roof. It would seem that we are both unlucky in love, eh? Bad luck"

Worse luck for our lovers. Who would have dreamed we have so much in\ncommon?' Ferro wondered about shoving the pink bastard off the balcony after his\ntea. But he still owed her, and she meant to collect. So she only scowled, and\nducked back through the doorway.\nThere was a new arrival in the room. A man with curly hair and a wide smile. He\nhad a tall staff in his hand, a case of weathered leather over one shoulder. There was\nsomething strange about his eyes— one light, one dark. There was something about\nhis watchful gaze that made Ferro suspicious. Even more than usual.\n'Ah, the famous Ferro Maljinn. Forgive my curiosity, but it is not every day that\none encounters a person of your… remarkable ancestry.'\nFerro did not like that he knew her name, or her ancestry, or anything about her.\n'Who are you?'\n'Where are my manners? I am Yoru Sulfur, of the order of Magi,' and he offered\nhis hand. She did not take it but he only smiled. 'Not one of the original twelve, of\ncourse, not I. Merely an afterthought. A late addition. I was once apprentice to great\nBayaz.'\nFerro snorted. That hardly qualified him for trust in her estimation. 'What\nhappened?'\n'I graduated.'\nBayaz tossed his cup down rattling on a table by the window. 'Yoru,' he said, and\nthe newcomer humbly bowed his head. 'My thanks for your work thus far. Precise\nand to the point, as always.'\nSulfur's smile grew broader. 'A small cog in a large machine, Master Bayaz, but I\ntry to be a sturdy one.'\n'You have yet to let me down. I do not forget that. How is your next little game\nprogressing?'\n'Ready to begin, at your command.'\n'Let us begin now. There is nothing to be gained by delay.'\n'I shall make the preparations. I have also brought this, as you asked.' He swung\nthe bag down from his shoulder and gingerly reached inside. He slowly drew out a\nbook. Large and black, its heavy covers hacked, and scarred, and charred by fire.\n'Glustrod's book,' he murmured softly, as though afraid to say the words.\nBayaz frowned. 'Keep it, for now. There was an unexpected complication.'\n'A complication?' Sulfur slid the book back into its case with some relief.\n'What we sought… was not there.'\n'Then—'\n'As regards our other plans, nothing is changed.'\n'Of course.' Sulfur bowed his head again. 'Lord Isher will already be on his way.'\n'Very well.' Bayaz glanced over at Ferro, as though he had only just remembered\nthat she was there. 'For the time being, perhaps you would be good enough to give\nus the room? I have a visitor that I must attend to.'\nShe was happy to leave, but she took her time moving, if only because Bayaz\nwanted her gone quickly. She unfolded her arms, stood on the spot and stretched."

She stopped on the way to gaze at\na picture, to poke at a chair, to flick at a shiny pot, none of which interested her at\nall. All the while Quai watched, and Bayaz frowned, and Sulfur grinned his knowing\nlittle grin. She stopped in the doorway.\n'Now?'\n'Yes, now,' snapped Bayaz.\nShe looked round the room one more time. 'Fucking Magi,' she snorted, and slid\nthrough the door.\nShe almost walked into a tall old pink in the room beyond. He wore a heavy robe,\neven in the heat, and had a sparkling chain around his shoulders. A big man loomed\nbehind him, grim and watchful. A guard. Ferro did not like the old pink's look. He\nstared down his nose at her, chin tilted up, as though she were a dog.\nAs though she were a slave.\n'Ssssss.' She hissed in his face as she shouldered past him. He gave an outraged\nsnort and his guard gave Ferro a hard look. She ignored it. Hard looks mean\nnothing. If he wanted her knee in his face he could try and touch her. But he did not.\nThe two of them went in through the door.\n'Ah, Lord Isher!' she heard Bayaz saying, just before it shut. 'I am delighted that\nyou could visit us at short notice.'\n'I came at once.

He\nwatched Ardee looking out of the window, her elbows on the sill, her chin on her\nhands. He watched Ardee, and he thanked the fates that some long-forgotten\ndesigner of military apparel had seen fit to provide the officers of the King's Own\nwith a high-waisted jacket. He thanked them with a deep and earnest gratitude,\nbecause his jacket was all she was wearing.\nIt was amazing how things had changed between them, since that bitter,\nbewildering reunion. For a week they had not spent a night apart, and for a week the\nsmile had barely left his face. Occasionally the memory would wallow up, of course,\nunbidden and horribly surprising, like a bloated corpse bobbing to the surface of the\npond while one enjoys a picnic on the shore, of Ardee biting and hitting him, crying\nand screaming in his face. But when it did so he would fix his grin, and see her smile\nat him, and soon enough he would be able to shove those unpleasant thoughts back\ndown again, at least for now. Then he would congratulate himself on being a big\nenough man to do it, and on giving her the benefit of the doubt.\n'Ardee,' he wheedled at her.\n'Mmm?'\n'Come back to bed.'\n'Why?'"

Strange, how the more he said it, the easier it became.\nShe gave a bored sigh. 'So you keep saying.'\n'It's true.'\nShe turned round, hands on the sill behind, her body a dark outline against the\nbright window. 'And what does that mean, exactly? That you've been fucking me for\na week and you haven't had enough yet?'\n'I don't think I'll ever get enough.'\n'Well,' and she pushed herself away from the window and padded across the\nboards. 'I don't suppose there's any harm in finding out, is there? No more harm,\nanyway.' She stopped at the foot of the bed. 'Just promise me one thing.'\nJezal swallowed, worried at what she might ask him, worried at what he might say\nin reply. 'Anything,' he murmured, forcing himself to smile.\n'Don't let me down.'\nHis smile grew easier. That was not so hard to say yes to. He was a changed\nman, after all. 'Of course, I promise.'\n'Good.' She crept up on to the bed, on her hands and knees, eyes fixed on his\nface while he wriggled his toes in anticipation under the sheet. She knelt up, one leg\non either side of him, and jerked the jacket smooth across her chest. 'Well then,\nCaptain, do I pass muster?'\n'I would say…' and he grabbed the front of the jacket and pulled her down on\ntop of him, slipped his hands inside it, 'that you are without a doubt…' and he slid\nhis hand under her breast and rubbed at her nipple with his thumb, 'the finest-looking\nsoldier in my company.'\nShe pressed her groin against his through the sheet, and worked her hips back\nand forward. 'Ah, the Captain is already at attention…'\n'For you? Constantly…'\nHer mouth licked and sucked at his, smearing spit on his face, and he pushed his\nhand between her legs and she rubbed herself against it for a while, his sticky fingers\nsquelching in and out of her. She grunted and sighed in her throat, and he did the\nsame. She reached down and dragged the sheet out of the way. He took hold of his\nprick and she wriggled her hips until they found the right spot and worked her way\ndown onto him, her hair tickling at his face, her rasping breath tickling at his ear.\nThere were two heavy knocks at the door, and they both froze. Another two\nknocks. Ardee put her head up, pushing her hair out of her flushed face. 'What is it?'\nshe called, voice thick and throaty.\n'There's someone for the Captain.' The maid. 'Is he… is he still here?'\nArdee's eyes rolled down to Jezal's. 'I daresay I could get a message to him!'

'Lord Marshal Varuz\nneeds to speak to the Captain urgently. They're all over town looking for him.' Jezal\ncursed under his breath. It seemed that the army had finally realised he was back.\n'Tell him that when I see the Captain I will let him know!' shouted Ardee, and the\nsound of footsteps retreated down the corridor outside.\n'Fuck!' Jezal hissed as soon as he was sure the maid was gone, not that she could\nhave been in too much doubt about what had been going on for the past few days\nand nights. 'I'll have to go.'\n'Now?'\n'Now, curse them. If I don't they'll just keep looking, and the sooner I go, the\nsooner I can get back.'\nShe sighed and rolled over onto her back while he slithered off the bed and\nstarted hunting round the room for his scattered clothes. His shirt had a wine stain\ndown the front, his trousers were creased and rumpled, but they would have to do.\nCutting the perfect figure was no longer his one goal in life. He sat down on the bed\nto pull his boots on and he felt her kneel behind him, her hands sliding across his\nchest, her lips brushing at his ear as she whispered to him. 'So you'll be leaving me\nall alone again, will you? Heading off to Angland, to slaughter Northmen with my\nbrother?'\nJezal leaned down with some difficulty and heaved one boot on. 'Perhaps.\nPerhaps not.' The idea of the soldiering life no longer inspired him. He had seen\nenough of violence, close up, to know it was extremely frightening and hurt like hell.\nGlory and fame seemed like meagre rewards for all the risks involved. 'I'm giving\nserious thought to the idea of resigning my commission.'\n'You are? And doing what?'\n'I'm not sure.' He turned his head and raised an eyebrow at her. 'Maybe I'll find a\ngood woman and settle down.'\n'A good woman? Do you know any?'\n'I was hoping you might have some suggestions.'\nShe pressed her lips together. 'Let me think. Does she have to be beautiful?'\n'No, no, beautiful women are always so bloody demanding. Plain as ditchwater,\nplease.'\n'Clever?'\nJezal snorted. 'Anything but that. I am notorious for my empty-headedness. A\nclever woman would only make me look the dunce the whole time.' He dragged the\nother boot on, peeled her hands away and stood up. 'A wide-eyed and thoughtless\ncalf would be ideal. Someone to endlessly agree with me.'\nArdee clapped her hands. 'Oh yes, I can see her on you now, trailing from your\narm like an empty dress, a kind of echo at a higher pitch. Noble blood though, I\nimagine?'\n'Of course, nothing but the best. One point on which I could never compromise.\nAnd fair hair, I have a weakness for it.'\n'Oh, I entirely agree. Dark hair is so commonplace, so very much the colour of\ndirt, and filth, and muck.' She shuddered. 'I feel sullied just thinking of it.'"

'I feel sullied just thinking of it.'\n'Above all,' as he pushed his sword through the clasp on his belt, 'a calm and\neven temper. I have had my fill of surprises.'\n'Naturally. Life is difficult enough without a woman making trouble. So terribly\nundignified.' She raised her eyebrows. 'I will think through my acquaintance.'\n'Excellent. In the meantime, and although you wear it with far greater dash than I\never could, I will need my jacket.'\n'Oh, yes, sir.' She pulled it off and flung it at him, then stretched out on the bed,\nstark naked, back arched, hands above her head, wriggling her hips slowly back and\nforth, one knee in the air, the other leg stretched out, big toe pointing at him. 'You\naren't going to leave me alone for too long, though, are you?'\nHe watched her for a moment. 'Don't you dare move a fucking inch,' he croaked,\nthen he pulled the jacket on, wedged his prick between his thighs and waddled out\nthe door, bent over. He hoped it would go down before he had his briefing with the\nLord Marshal, but he was not entirely sure it would.\nOnce again, Jezal found himself in one of High Justice Marovia's cavernous\nchambers, standing all alone on the empty floor, facing the enormous, polished table\nwhile three old men regarded him grimly from the other side.\nAs the clerk shut the high doors with an echoing boom, he had a deeply worrying\nsense of having lived through this very experience before. The day he had been\nsummoned from the boat for Angland, torn from his friends and his ambitions, to be\nsent on a madcap, doomed journey into the middle of nowhere. A journey that had\ncost him some of his looks and nearly his life. It was safe to say that he did not\nentirely relish being back here, and hoped most fervently for a better outcome.\nFrom that point of view, the absence of the First of the Magi was something of a\ntonic, even if the panel was otherwise far from comforting. Facing him were the hard\nold faces of Lord Marshal Varuz, High Justice Marovia, and Lord Chamberlain\nHoff.\nVaruz was busy waxing on about Jezal's fine achievements in the Old Empire. He\nhad, evidently, heard a very different version of events from the one that Jezal\nhimself remembered.\n'… great adventures in the west, as I understand it, bringing honour to the Union\non foreign fields. I was particularly impressed by the story of your charge across the\nbridge at Darmium. Did that really happen the way I have been told?'\n'Across the bridge, sir, well, truthfully, er…' He should probably have asked the\nold fool what the hell he was talking about, but he was far too busy thinking of\nArdee, stretched out naked. Shit on his country. Duty be damned. He could resign\nhis commission now and be back in her bed before the hour was out.

'It was the one\nabout the Emperor's daughter that most caught my fancy.'

Nothing\nof the kind occurred, I assure you. The whole business appears somehow to have\nbecome greatly exaggerated—'\n'Well, one glorious rumour is worth ten disappointing truths, would you not\nagree?'\nJezal blinked. 'Well, er, I suppose—'\n'In any case,' cut in Varuz, 'the Closed Council have received excellent reports of\nyour conduct while abroad.'\n'They have?'\n'Many and various reports, and all glowing.'\nJezal could not help grinning, though he had to wonder from whom such reports\nmight have come. He could scarcely imagine Ferro Maljinn gushing about his fine\nqualities. 'Well, your lordships are very kind, but I must—'\n'As a result of your dedication and courage in this difficult and vital task, I am\ndelighted to announce that you have been elevated to the rank of Colonel, with\nimmediate effect.'\nJezal's eyes opened up very wide. 'I have?'\n'You have indeed, my boy, and no one could deserve it more.'\nTo rise two ranks in one afternoon was an unprecedented honour, especially\nwhen he had fought in no battle, carried out no recent deeds of valour, and made no\nultimate sacrifices. Unless you counted leaving off the most recent bedding of his\nbest friend's sister halfway. A sacrifice, no doubt, but scarcely the kind that usually\nearned the King's favour.\n'I, er, I…' He could not escape a glow of satisfaction. A new uniform, and more\nbraid, and so forth, and more people to tell what to do. Glory and fame were meagre\nrewards, perhaps, but he had taken the risks already, and now had only to say yes.\nHad he not suffered? Had he not earned it?\nHe did not have to think about it for so very long. He scarcely had to think about\nit at all. The idea of leaving the army and settling down receded rapidly into the far\ndistance. 'I would be entirely honoured to accept this exceptional… er… honour.'\n'Then we are all equally delighted,' said Hoff sourly. 'Now to business. You are\naware, Colonel Luthar, that there has been some trouble with the peasants of late?'\nSurprisingly, no news had reached Ardee's bedroom. 'Nothing serious, surely,\nyour Grace?'\n'Not unless you call a full-blown revolt serious.'\n'Revolt?' Jezal swallowed.\n'This man, the Tanner,' spat the Lord Chamberlain. 'He has been touring the\ncountryside for months, whipping up dissatisfaction, sowing the seeds of\ndisobedience, inciting the peasantry to crimes against their masters, against their\nlords, against their king!'\n'No one ever suspected it would reach the point of open rebellion.'

They are in the process of ravaging the countryside in\nthe direction of Adua.'\n'Ravaging?' murmured Jezal, glancing at the door. Ravaging really was a very ugly\nword.\n'It is a most regrettable business,' bemoaned Marovia. 'Half of them are honest\nmen, faithful to their king, pushed to this through the greed of their landlords.'\nVaruz sneered his disgust. 'There can be no excuse for treason!

'And the\nringleaders delivered to his Majesty's Inquisition.'\n'Regrettable,' murmured Jezal, without thinking, feeling a cold shiver at the very\nmention of that institution.\n'Necessary,' said Marovia, sadly shaking his head.\n'But hardly straightforward.' Varuz frowned at Jezal across the table. 'In each\nvillage, in each town, in every field and farm they have passed through they have\npicked up more recruits. The country is alive with malcontents. Ill-disciplined, of\ncourse, and ill-equipped, but at our last estimate they numbered some forty\nthousand.'\n'Forty… thousand?' Jezal shifted his weight nervously. He had supposed they\nwere perhaps discussing a few hundred, and those without proper footwear. There\nwas no danger here, of course, safe behind the walls of the Agriont, the walls of the\ncity. But forty thousand was an awful lot of very angry men. Even if they were\npeasants.\n'The King's Own are making their preparations: one regiment of horse and one of\nfoot.

It\nwas no surprise, really, that the bald old meddler was involved in this. Strange and\npainful events seemed to follow in his wake like stray dogs barking behind the\nbutcher's wagon.\n'The peasants' army, if we can call it such, is camped within four days' slovenly\nmarch of the city, spread out across the country, seeking for forage.'

'A word, Colonel Luthar.'\n'If you are referring to this business with the peasants, it is well in hand.' Jezal was\nunable to keep the sneer of disgust entirely off his face. 'You need not trouble\nyourself on that—'\n'I am not referring to that business.'\n'Then what?'\n'Ardee West.'\nThe corridor seemed suddenly very empty, very quiet. The soldiers, the officers,\nthe servants, all away in Angland. There were just the two of them, for all Jezal knew,\nin the entire barracks. 'I fail to see how that is any concern of—'\n'Her brother, our mutual friend Collem West, you do remember him?\nWorried-looking fellow, losing his hair. Bit of a temper.' Jezal felt a guilty flush\nacross his face. He remembered the man well enough, of course, and his temper in\nparticular. 'He came to me shortly before departing for the war in Angland. He asked\nme to look to his sister's welfare while he was away, risking his life. I promised to do\nso.' Glokta shuffled slightly closer and Jezal's flesh crept. 'A responsibility which, I\nassure you, I take as seriously as any task the Arch Lector might choose to give me.'\n'I see,' croaked Jezal. That certainly explained the cripple's presence at her house\nthe other day, which had, until then, been causing him some confusion. He felt no\neasier in his mind, however. Considerably less, in fact.\n'I hardly think that Collem West would be best pleased with what has been\ntranspiring these last few days, do you?'\nJezal shifted guiltily from one foot to the other. 'I admit that I have visited her—'\n'Your visits,' whispered the cripple, 'are not good for that girl's reputation. We\nare left with three options. Firstly, and this is my personal favourite, you walk away,\nand you pretend you never met her, and you never see her again.'\n'Unacceptable,' Jezal found himself saying, his voice surprisingly brash.\n'Secondly, then, you marry the lady, and all's forgotten.'\nA course that Jezal was considering, but he was damned if he'd be bullied into it\nby this twisted remnant of a man. 'And third?' he enquired, with what he felt was\nfitting contempt.\n'Third?' A particularly disgusting flurry of twitches crawled up the side of\nGlokta's wasted face. 'I don't think you want to know too much about number three."

'I don't think you want to know too much about number three.\nLet us only say that it will include a long night of passion with a furnace and a set of\nrazors, and an even longer morning involving a sack, an anvil, and the bottom of the\ncanal. You might find that one of the other two options suits you better.'\nBefore he knew what he was doing Jezal had taken a step forward, forcing Glokta\nto rock back, wincing, against the wall. 'I do not have to explain myself to you! My\nvisits are between me and the lady in question, but for your information, I long ago\nresolved to marry her, and am merely waiting for the right moment!' Jezal stood there\nin the darkness, hardly able to believe what he had heard himself say. Damn his\nmouth, it still landed him in all manner of trouble.\nGlokta's narrow left eye blinked. 'Ah, lucky her.'\nJezal found himself moving forward again, almost butting the cripple in the face\nand crushing him helpless against the wall. 'That's right! So you can shove your\nthreats up your crippled arse!'\nEven squashed against the wall, Glokta's surprise only lasted an instant. Then he\nleered his toothless grin, his eyelid fluttering and a long tear running down his gaunt\ncheek. 'Why, Colonel Luthar, it is difficult for me to concentrate with you so very\nclose.' He stroked the front of Jezal's uniform with the back of his hand. 'Especially\ngiven your unexpected interest in my arse.' Jezal jerked back, mouth sour with\ndisgust. 'It seems that Bayaz succeeded where Varuz failed, eh? He taught you where\nyour spine is! My congratulations on your forthcoming wedding. But I think I'll keep\nmy razors handy, just in case you don't follow through. I'm so glad we had this\nchance to talk.' And Glokta limped off towards the stairs, his cane tapping on the\nboards, his left boot scraping along behind.\n'As am I!' shouted Jezal after him. But nothing could have been further from the\ntruth.\nGhosts\n« ^ »\nUffrith didn't look much like it used to. Of course, the last time Logen had seen the\nplace had been years ago, at night, after the siege. Crowds of Bethod's Carls\nwandering the streets—shouting, and singing, and drinking. Looking for folk to rob\nand rape, setting fire to anything that would hold a flame. Logen remembered lying in\nthat room after he'd beaten Threetrees, crying and gurgling at the pain all through\nhim. He remembered scowling out the window and seeing the glow from the flames,\nlistening to the screams over the town, wishing he was out there making mischief and\nwondering if he'd ever stand up again.\nIt was different now, with the Union in charge, but it wasn't so very much more\norganised.

Carts and\nmules and horses, all loaded down and piled up, tried to shove a way through the\npress. Wounded limped on crutches down towards the docks, or were carried on\nstretchers through the spotting drizzle, bloody bandages stared at wide-eyed by the\nfresh-faced lads going the other way. Here and there, looking greatly puzzled at this\nmighty flood of strange people sweeping through their town, some Northerner was\nstanding in a doorway. Women mostly, and children, and old men.\nLogen walked fast up the sloping streets, pushing through the crowds with his\nhead down and his hood up. He kept his fists bunched at his sides, so no one would\nsee the stump of his missing finger. He kept the sword that Bayaz had given him\nwrapped up in a blanket on his back, under his pack, where it wouldn't make anyone\nnervous. All the same, his shoulders prickled every step of the way. He was waiting\nto hear someone shout, 'It's the Bloody-Nine!' He was waiting for folk to start\nrunning, screaming, pelting him with rubbish, faces all stamped with horror.\nBut no one did. One more figure that didn't belong was nothing to look at in all\nthat damp chaos, and if anyone might have known him here, they weren't looking for\nhim. Most likely they'd all heard he went back to the mud, far away, and were good\nand glad about it too. Still, there was no point staying longer than he had to. He\nstrode up to a Union officer who looked as if he might be in charge of something,\npushed his hood back and tried to put a smile on his face.\nHe got a scornful look for his trouble. 'We've no work for you, if that's what\nyou're looking for.'\n'You don't have my kind of work.' Logen held out the letter that Bayaz had given\nhim.\nThe man unfolded it and looked it over. He frowned and read it again. Then he\nlooked doubtfully up at Logen, mouth working. 'Well then. I see.' He pointed\ntowards a crowd of young men, standing nervous and uncertain a few strides away,\nhuddled miserably together as the rain started to thicken up. 'There's a convoy of\nreinforcements leaving for the front this afternoon. You can travel with us.'\n'Fair enough.' They didn't look like they'd be much reinforcement, those\nscared-seeming lads, but that didn't matter to him. He didn't much care who he\ntravelled with, as long as they were pointed at Bethod.\nThe trees clattered by on either side of the road—dim green and black, full of\nshadows. Full of surprises, maybe. It was a tough way to travel. Tough on the hands\nfrom clinging to the rail all the way, even tougher on the arse from bouncing and\njolting on that hard seat. But they were getting there, gradually, and Logen reckoned\nthat was the main thing.\nThere were more carts behind, spread out in a slow line along the road, loaded\ndown with men, food, clothes, weapons, and all the stuff you need to make a war."

Nine of them, all jolting and swaying about together with the jumping of\nthe axles, and all keeping as well clear of him as they could.\n'You seen scars like that on a man before?' one muttered, not guessing he could\nspeak their tongue.\n'Who is he anyway?'\n'Dunno. A Northman, I guess.'\n'I can see he's a Northman, idiot. I mean what's he doing here with us?'\n'Maybe he's a scout.'\n'Big bastard for a scout, ain't he?'\nLogen grinned to himself as he watched the trees roll past. He felt the cool breeze\non his face, smelled the mist, the earth, the cold, wet, air. He never would have\nthought he'd be happy to be back in the North, but he was. It was good, after all that\ntime a stranger, to be in a place where he knew the rules.\nThey camped out on the road, the ten of them. One group out of many, strung\nout through the woods, each one clustered close to their cart. Nine lads on one side\nof a big fire, a pot of stew bubbling over the top of it and giving off a fine-smelling\nsteam. Logen watched them stirring it, talking to each other about home, and what\nwas coming, and how long they'd be out there.\nAfter a while one of them started spooning the food out into bowls and handing\nthem round. He looked over at Logen, once he was done with the rest, then served\nup one more. He edged over like he was coming at a wolfs cage.\n'Er…' He held the bowl out at arm's length. 'Stew?' He opened his mouth up wide\nand pointed into it with his free hand.\n'Thanks, friend,' said Logen as he took the bowl, 'but I know where to put it.'\nThe lads all stared at him, a row of worried-looking faces, lit up flickering yellow\non the far side of the fire, more suspicious than ever at him speaking their language.\n'You talk common? You kept that quiet, didn't you?'\n'Best to seem less than you are, in my experience.'\n'If you say so,' said the lad who'd given him the bowl. 'What's your name, then?'\nLogen wondered for a moment if he should make up a lie. Some nothing name\nthat no one could have heard of. But he was who he was, and sooner or later\nsomeone would know him. That, and he'd never been much at lying. 'Logen\nNinefingers, they call me.'\nThe lads looked blank.

They looked like they\nbarely knew their own names.\n'What are you here for?' one of them asked him.\n'Same as you. I'm here to kill.' The boys looked a bit nervy at that. 'Not you,\ndon't worry. I've got some scores to settle.' He nodded off up the road. 'With\nBethod.'\nThe lads exchanged some glances, then one of them shrugged. 'Well. Long as\nyou're on our side, I guess.' He got up and dragged a bottle out of his pack. 'You\nwant a drink?'\n'Well, now.' Logen grinned and held out his cup. 'I've never yet said no to that.'\nHe knocked it down in one, smacked his lips as he felt it warming his gullet. The lad\npoured him another. 'Thanks. Best not give me too much, though.'\n'Why?' he asked. 'Will you kill us then?'\n'Kill you? If you're lucky.'\n'And if we're not?'\nLogen grinned over his mug. 'I'll sing.'\nThe lad cracked a smile at that, and one of his mates started laughing. Next\nmoment an arrow hissed into his side and he coughed blood down his shirt, the\nbottle dropping on the grass, wine gurgling out in the dark. Another boy had a shaft\nsticking in his thigh. He sat there, frozen, staring down at it. 'Where did that…' Then\neveryone was shouting, fumbling for weapons or throwing themselves flat on their\nfaces. A couple more arrows whizzed over, one clattering into the fire and sending\nup a shower of sparks.\nLogen threw his stew away, snatched up his sword and started running. He\nblundered into one of the boys on the way and knocked him on his face, slipped and\nslid, righted himself and ran full tilt for the trees where the arrow came from. It was\nrun right at them, or run away, and he made the choice without thinking. Sometimes\nit doesn't matter too much what choice you make, as long as you make it quick and\nstick to it. Logen saw one of the archers as he rushed up close, a flash of his pale\nskin in the darkness as he reached for another arrow. He pulled the Maker's sword\nfrom its tattered sheath and let go a fighting roar.\nThe bowman could've got his arrow away before Logen was on him, most likely,\nbut it would've been a close thing, and in the end he didn't have the bones to stand\nthere waiting. Not many men can weigh their choices properly while death comes\nracing up at them. He dropped the bow too late and turned to run, and Logen\nhacked him in the back before he got more than a stride or two, knocked him\nscreaming into the bushes. He dragged himself round face up, all tangled in the\nbrush, screeching and fumbling for a knife. Logen lifted the sword to finish the job.\nThen blood sprayed out of the archer's mouth and he trembled, fell back and was\nquiet.\n'Still alive,' Logen mouthed to himself, squatting down low beside the corpse,"

It would probably have been better for all concerned if\nhe'd run the other way, but it was a bit late for that. Probably have been better if he'd\nstayed in Adua, but it was a bit late for that too.\n'Bloody North,' he cursed in a whisper. If he let these bastards go they'd be\nmaking mischief all the way to the front and Logen wouldn't get a wink of sleep for\nworrying, aside from the good chance of an arrow in his face. Better odds coming\nfor them, than waiting for them to come to him. A lesson he'd learned from hard\nexperience.\nHe could hear the rest of the ambush crashing away through the brush and he set\nout after them, fist clenched tight round the grip of his sword. He felt his way\nbetween the trunks, keeping his distance. The light of the fire and the noise of the\nUnion boys shouting dwindled behind him until he was deep in the woods, smelling\nof pines and wet earth, only the sound of men's hurrying feet to guide him. He made\nhimself part of the forest, the way he had in the old days. It wasn't so hard to do.\nThe knack came right back as though he'd been creeping in the trees every night for\nyears. Voices echoed through the night, and Logen pressed himself still and silent up\nbehind a pine-trunk, listening.\n'Where's Dirty-Nose?'\nThere was a pause. 'Dead, I reckon.'\n'Dead? How?'\n'They had someone with 'em, Crow. Some big fucker.' Crow. Logen knew the\nname. Knew the voice too, now that he heard it. A Named Man who'd fought for\nLittlebone. You couldn't have called them friends, him and Logen, but they'd known\neach other. They'd been close together in the line at Carleon, fighting side by side.\nAnd now here they were again with no more than a few strides between them, more\nthan willing to kill each other. Strange, the turns fate can take. Fighting with a man\nand fighting against him are only a whisker apart. Far closer together than not fighting\nat all.\n'Northman, was he?' came Crow's voice.\n'Might've been. Whoever it was he knew his business. Came up real quick. I\ndidn't have time to get a shaft away.'\n'Bastard! We ain't letting that pass. We'll camp out here and follow 'em\ntomorrow. Might be we'll get him then, this big one.'\n'Oh aye, we'll fucking get him. Don't you worry about that none. I'll cut his neck\nfor him, the bastard.'\n'Good for you. 'Til then you can keep an eye open for him while the rest of us\ncatch some sleep. Might be the anger'll keep you awake this time, eh?'\n'Aye, chief.

The fifth took his place, back to the\nothers, and looked out the way they'd come, sitting guard. Logen waited, and he\nheard one begin to snore. Some rain started up, and it tapped and trickled on the\nbranches of the pines. After a while it spattered into his hair, into his clothes, ran\ndown his face and fell to the wet earth, drip, drip, drip. Logen sat, still and silent as a\nstone.\nIt can be a fearsome weapon, patience. One that few men ever learn to use. A\nhard thing, to keep your mind on killing once you're out of danger and your blood's\ncooled off. But Logen had always had the trick of it. So he sat and let the slow time\nsneak by, and thought about long ago, until the moon was high, and there was pale\nlight washing down between the trees with the tickling rain. Pale light enough for him\nto see his tasks by.\nHe uncurled his legs and started moving, working his way between the tree\ntrunks, planting his feet nice and gentle in the brush. The rain was his ally, patter and\ntrickle masking the soft sounds his boots made as he circled round behind the guard.\nHe slid out a knife, wet blade glinting once in the patchy moonlight, and he\npadded out from the trees and through their camp. Between the sleeping men, close\nenough to touch them. Close as a brother. The guard sniffed and shifted unhappily,\ndragging his wet blanket round his shoulders, all beaded up with twinkling rain\ndrops. Logen stopped and waited, looked down at the pale face of one of the\nsleepers, turned sideways, eyes closed and mouth wide open, breath making faint\nsmoke in the clammy night.\nThe guard was still now, and Logen slipped up close behind him, holding his\nbreath. He reached out with his left hand, fingers working in the misty air, feeling for\nthe moment. He reached out with his right hand, fist clenched tight round the hard\ngrip of his knife. He felt his lips curling back from his gritted teeth. Now was the\ntime, and when the time comes, you strike with no backward glances.\nLogen reached round and clamped his hand tight over the guard's mouth, cut his\nthroat quick and hard, deep enough that he felt the blade scraping on his neck bones.\nHe jerked and struggled for a moment, but Logen held him tight, tight as a lover, and\nhe made no more than a quiet gurgle. Logen felt blood over his hands, hot and\nsticky. He didn't worry yet about the others. If one of them woke all they'd see\nwould be the outline of one man in the darkness, and that was all they were\nexpecting.\nIt wasn't long before the guard went limp, and Logen laid him down gently on his\nside, head flopping. Four shapes lay there under their wet blankets, helpless. Maybe\nthere'd been a time when Logen would've had to work himself up to a job like this.\nWhen he'd have had to think about why it was the right thing to do. But if there had"

But if there had\nbeen, it was long gone. Up in the North, the time you spend thinking will be the time\nyou get killed in. All they were now were four tasks to get done.\nHe crept up to the first, lifted his bloody knife, overhand, and stabbed him clean\nin the heart right through his coat, hand pressed over his mouth. He died quieter than\nhe slept. Logen came up on the second one, ready to do the same. His boot\nclattered into something metal. Water flask, maybe. Whatever it was, it made quite\nthe racket. The sleeping man's eyes worked open, he started to lift himself up. Logen\nrammed the knife in his gut and dragged at it, slitting his belly open. He made a kind\nof a wheeze, mouth and eyes wide, clutching at Logen's arm.\n'Eh?' The third one sat straight up and staring. Logen tore his hand free and\nheaved his sword out. 'Wha' the—' The man lifted his arm up, on an instinct, and the\ndull blade took his hand off at the wrist and chopped deep into his skull, sending\nblack spots of blood showering into the wet air and knocking him down on his back.\nBut that gave the last of them time enough to roll out of his blanket and grab up\nan axe. Now he stood hunched over, hands spread out, fighting ready like a man\nwho'd had plenty of practice at it. Crow. Logen could hear his breath hissing, see it\nsmoking in the rain.\n'You should've started wi' me!' he hissed.\nLogen couldn't deny it. He'd been concentrating on getting them all killed, and\nhadn't paid much mind to the order. Still, it was a bit late to worry now. He\nshrugged. 'Start or finish, ain't too much difference.'\n'We'll see.' Crow weighed his axe in the misty air, shifting around, looking for an\nopening. Logen stood still and caught his breath, the sword hanging down by his\nside, the grip cold and wet in his clenched fist. He'd never been much of a one for\nmoving until it was time. 'Best tell me your name, while you still got breath in you. I\nlike to know who I've killed.'\n'You already know me, Crow.' Logen held his other hand up, and he let the\nfingers spread out, and the moonlight glinted black on his bloody hand, and on the\nbloody stump of his missing finger. 'We were side by side in the line at Carleon.\nNever thought you'd all forget me so soon. But things don't often turn out the way\nwe expect, eh?'\nHe'd stopped moving now, had Crow. Logen couldn't see more than a gleam of\nhis eyes in the dark, but he could tell the doubt and the fear in the way he stood.\n'No,' he whispered, shaking his head in the darkness. 'Can't be! Ninefingers is dead!'\n'That so?' Logen took a deep breath and pushed it out, slow, into the wet night.\n'Reckon I must be his ghost.'"

        "text": "'That so?' Logen took a deep breath and pushed it out, slow, into the wet night.\n'Reckon I must be his ghost.'\nThey'd dug some sort of a hole to squat in, the Union lads, sacks and boxes up on\nthe sides as a rampart. Logen could see the odd face moving over the top, staring\noff into the trees, the dull light from the guttering fire glinting on an arrow head or a\nspear tip. Dug in, watching for another ambush. If they'd been nervy before, they\nwere most likely shitting themselves now. Probably one of them would get scared\nand shoot him as soon as he made himself known. Damn Union bows had a trigger\nthat went off at a touch, once they were drawn. Would have been just about his luck,\nto get killed over nothing in the middle of nowhere, and by his own side too, but he\ndidn't have much of a choice. Not unless he wanted to walk up to the front.\nSo he cleared his throat and called out. 'Now no one shoot or anything!' A string\nwent and a bolt thudded into a tree a couple of strides to his left. Logen hunched\ndown against the wet earth. 'No one shoot, I said!'\n'Who's out there?'\n'It's me, Ninefingers!' Silence. 'The Northman who was on the cart!'\nA long pause, and some whispering. 'Alright! But come out slow, and keep your\nhands where we can see them!'\n'Fair enough!' He straightened up and crept out from the trees, hands held high.\n'Just don't shoot me, eh? That's your end of the deal!'\nHe walked across the ground towards the fire, arms spread out, wincing at the\nthought of getting a bolt in his chest any minute. He recognised the faces of the lads\nfrom before, them and the officer who had charge of the supply column. A couple\nof them followed him with their bows as he stepped slowly over the makeshift\nparapet and down into the trench. It had been dug along in front of the fire, but not\nthat well, and there was a big puddle in the bottom.\n'Where the hell did you get to?' demanded the officer angrily.\n'Tracking them that ambushed us tonight.'\n'Did you catch 'em?' one of the boys asked.\n'That I did.'\n'And?'\n'Dead.' Logen nodded at the puddle in the bottom of the hole. 'So you needn't\nsleep in the water tonight. Any of that stew left?'\n'How many were there?' snapped the officer.\nLogen poked around the embers of the fire, but the pot was empty. Just his luck,\nagain. 'Five.'\n'You, on your own, against five?'\n'There were six to begin with, but I killed one at the start. He's in the trees over\nthere somewhere.' Logen dug a heel of bread out of his pack and rubbed it round the\ninside of the pot, trying to get a bit of meat grease on there, at least. 'I waited until\nthey were sleeping, so I only had to fight one of 'em, face to face. Always been\nlucky that way, I guess.' He didn't feel that lucky. Looking at his hand in the firelight,"

Looking at his hand in the firelight,\nit was still stained with blood. Dark blood under his fingernails, dried into the lines in\nhis palm. 'Always been lucky.'\nThe officer hardly looked convinced. 'How do we know that you aren't one of\nthem? That you weren't spying on us? That they aren't waiting out there now, for you\nto give them a signal when we're vulnerable?'\n'You've been vulnerable the whole way,' snorted Logen. 'But it's a fair question. I\nthought you might ask it.' He pulled the canvas bag out from his belt. 'That's why I\nbrought you this.' The officer frowned as he reached out for it, shook it open,\npeered suspiciously inside. He swallowed. 'Like I said, there were five. So you got\nten thumbs in there. That satisfy you?'\nThe officer looked more sick than satisfied, but he nodded, lips squeezed\ntogether, and held the bag back out to him at arm's length.\nLogen shook his head. 'Keep it. It's a finger I'm missing. I got all the thumbs I\nneed.'\nThe cart lurched to a stop. For the last mile or two they'd moved at a crawl. Now the\nroad, if you could use the word about a sea of mud, was choked up with floundering\nmen. They squelched their way from one near solid spot to another, flowing through\nthe thin rain between the press of mired carts and unhappy horses, the stacks of\ncrates and barrels, the ill-pitched tents. Logen watched a group of filth-caked lads\nstraining at a wagon stuck up to its axles in the muck, without much success. It was\nlike seeing an army sink slowly into a bog. A vast shipwreck, on land.\nLogen's travelling companions were down to seven now, hunched and gaunt,\nlooking mighty tired from sleepless nights and bad weather on the trail. One dead,\none sent back to Uffrith already with an arrow in his leg. Not the best start to their\ntime in the North, but Logen doubted it would get any better from here on. He\nclambered down off the back of the cart, boots sinking into the well-rutted mud,\narched his back and stretched his aching legs out, dragged his pack down.\n'Luck, then,' he said to the lads. None of them spoke. They'd hardly said a word\nto him since the night of the ambush. Most likely that whole business with the\nthumbs had got them worried. But if that was the worst they saw while they were up\nhere they'd have done alright, Logen reckoned. He shrugged and turned away,\nstarted floundering through the muck.\nJust up ahead the officer from the supply column was being dealt a talking-to by\na tall, grim-looking man in a red uniform, seemed like the closest thing they had in all\nthis mess to someone in charge. It took Logen a minute to recognise him. They'd sat\ntogether at a feast, in very different surroundings, and they'd talked of war. He\nlooked older, leaner, tougher, now.

He had a hard frown on his face and a lot of\nhard grey in his wet hair, but he grinned when he saw Logen standing there, and\nwalked up to him with his hand out.\n'By the dead,' he said in good Northern, 'but fate can play some tricks. I know\nyou.'\n'Likewise.'\n'Ninefingers, wasn't it?'\n'That's right. And you're West. From Angland.'\n'That I am. Sorry I can't give you a better welcome, but the army only got up here\na day or two ago and, as you can see, things aren't quite in order yet. Not there,\nidiot!' he roared at a driver trying to get his cart between two others, the space\nbetween them nowhere near wide enough. 'Do you have such a thing as summer in\nthis bloody country?'\n'You're looking at it. Didn't you see winter?'\n'Huh. You've a point there. What brings you up here, anyway?'\nLogen handed West the letter. He hunched over to shield it from the rain and read\nit, frowning.\n'Signed by Lord Chamberlain Hoff, eh?'\n'That a good thing?'\nWest pursed his lips as he handed the letter back. 'I suppose that depends. It\nmeans you've got some powerful friends. Or some powerful enemies.'\n'Bit of both, maybe.'\nWest grinned. 'I find they go together. You've come to fight?'\n'That I have.'\n'Good. We can always use a man with experience.' He watched the recruits\nclambering down off the carts and gave a long sigh. 'We've still got far too many\nhere without. You should go up and join the rest of the Northmen.'\n'You've got Northmen with you?'\n'We have, and more coming over every day. Seems that a lot of them aren't too\nhappy with the way their King has been leading them. About his deal with the Shanka\nin particular.'\n'Deal? With the Shanka?' Logen frowned. He'd never have thought that even\nBethod would stoop that low, but it was hardly the first time he'd been disappointed.\n'He's got Flatheads fighting with him?'\n'He certainly does. He's got Flatheads, and we've got Northmen. It's a strange\nworld, alright.'\n'That it surely is,' said Logen, shaking his head. 'How many do you have?'\n'About three hundred, I'd say, at last count, though they don't take too well to\nbeing counted.'\n'Reckon I'll make it three hundred and one, then, if you'll have me.'\n'They're camped up there, on the left wing,' and he pointed towards the dark\noutline of trees against the evening sky.\n'Right enough. Who's the chief?'\n'Fellow called the Dogman.'\nLogen stared at him for a long moment. 'Called the what?'\n'Dogman. You know him?'\n'You could say that,' whispered Logen, a smile spreading right across his face.\n'You could say that.'\nDusk was pressing on fast and night was pressing in fast behind, and they'd just got"

He could see the shapes of the Carls\ntaking their places down each side of it, heads and shoulders cut out black against\nthe flames. He could hear their voices and their laughter, loud in the still evening now\nthe rain had stopped.\nIt had been a long time since he heard a crowd of men all speaking Northern, and\nit sounded strange in his ears, even if it was his own tongue. It brought back some\nugly memories. Crowds of men shouting at him, shouting for him. Crowds charging\ninto battle, cheering their victories, mourning their dead. He could smell meat\ncooking from somewhere. A sweet, rich smell that tickled his nose and made his gut\ngrumble.\nThere was a torch set up on a pole by the path, and a bored-looking lad stood\nunderneath it with a spear, frowning at Logen as he walked up. Must've drawn the\nshort straw, to be on guard while the others were eating, and he didn't look too\nhappy about it.\n'What d'you want?' he growled.\n'You got the Dogman here?'\n'Aye, what of it?'\n'I'll need to speak to him.'\n'Will you, now?'\nAnother man walked up, well past his prime, with a shock of grey hair and a\nleathery face. 'What we got here?'\n'New recruit,' grumbled the lad. 'Wants to see the chief.'\nThe old man squinted at Logen, frowning. 'Do I know you, friend?'\nLogen lifted up his face so the torchlight fell across it. Better to look a man in the\neye, and let him see you, and show him you feel no fear. That was the way his father\nhad taught him. 'I don't know. Do you?'\n'Where did you come over from? Whitesides' crew, is it?'\n'No. I been working alone.'\n'Alone? Well, now. Seems like I recognise—' The old boy's eyes opened up\nwide, and his jaw sagged open, and his face went white as cut chalk. 'By all the\nfucking dead,' he whispered, taking a stumbling step back. 'It's the Bloody-Nine!'\nMaybe Logen had been hoping no one would know him. That they'd all have\nforgotten. That they'd have new things to worry them, and he'd be just a man like\nany other. But now he saw that look on the old boy's face—that shitting-himself\nlook, and it was clear enough how it would be. Just the way it used to be. And the\nworst of it was, now that Logen was recognised, and he saw that fear, and that\nhorror, and that respect, he wasn't sure that he didn't like seeing it. He'd earned it,\nhadn't he? After all, facts are facts.\nHe was the Bloody-Nine.\nThe lad didn't quite get it yet. 'Having a joke on me are yer? You'll be telling me\nit's Bethod his self come over next, eh?'

But no one laughed, and Logen lifted his\nhand up and stared through the gap where his middle finger used to be. The lad\nlooked from that stump, to the trembling old man and back.\n'Shit,' he croaked.\n'Where's your chief, boy?' Logen's own voice scared him. Flat, and dead, and\ncold as the winter.\n'He's… he's…' The lad raised a quivering finger to point towards the fires.\n'Well then. Guess I'll sniff him out myself.' The two of them edged out of\nLogen's way. He didn't exactly smile as he passed. More he drew his lips back to\nshow them his teeth. There was a certain reputation to be lived up to, after all. 'No\nneed to worry,' he hissed in their faces. 'I'm on your side, ain't I?'\nNo one said a word to him as he walked along behind the Carls, up towards the\nhead of the fire. A couple of them glanced over their shoulders, but nothing more\nthan any newcomer in a camp might get. They'd no idea who he was, yet, but they\nsoon would have. That lad and that old man would be whispering, and the whispers\nwould spread around the fire, as whispers do, and everyone would be watching him.\nHe started as a great shadow moved beside him, so big he'd taken it for a tree at\nfirst. A huge, big man, scratching at his beard, smiling at the fire. Tul Duru. There\ncould be no mistaking the Thunderhead, even in the half-light. Not a man that size.\nMade Logen wonder afresh how the hell he'd beaten him in the first place.\nHe felt a strange urge, right then, just to put his head down and walk past, off into\nthe night and never look back. Then he wouldn't have to be the Bloody-Nine again. It\nwould just have been a fresh lad and an old man, swore they saw a ghost one night.\nHe could've gone far away, and started new, and been whoever he wanted. But he'd\ntried that once already, and it had done him no good. The past was always right\nbehind him, breathing on his neck. It was time to turn around and face it.\n'Alright there, big lad.' Tul peered at him in the dusk, orange light and black\nshadow shifting across his big rock of a face, his big rug of a beard.\n'Who… hold on…' Logen swallowed. He'd no idea, now he thought about it,\nwhat any of them might make of seeing him again. They'd been enemies long before\nthey were friends, after all. Each one of them had fought him. Each one had been\nkeen to kill him, and with good reasons too. Then he'd run off south and left them to\nthe Shanka. What if all he got after a year or more apart was a cold look?\nThen Tul grabbed hold of him and folded him in a crushing hug. 'You're alive!'\nHe let go of him long enough to check he had the right man, then hugged him again.\n'Aye, I'm alive,' wheezed Logen, just enough breath left in him to say it. Seemed"

Seemed\nhe'd get one warm welcome, at least.\nTul was grinning all over his face. 'Come on.' And he beckoned Logen after. 'The\nlads are going to shit!'\nHe followed Tul, his heart beating in his mouth, up to the head of the fire, where\nthe chief would sit with his closest Named Men. And there they were, sat around on\nthe ground. Dogman was in the middle, muttering something quiet to Dow. Grim was\non the other side, leaning on one elbow, fiddling with the flights on his arrows. It was\njust like nothing had changed.\n'Got someone here to see you, Dogman,' said Tul, his voice squeaky from\nkeeping the surprise in.\n'Have you, now?' Dogman peered up at Logen, but he was hidden in the shadows\nbehind Tul's great shoulder. 'Can't it wait 'til after we've eaten?'\n'Do you know, I don't think it can.'\n'Why? Who is it?'\n'Who is it?' Tul grabbed Logen's shoulder and shoved him lurching out into the\nfirelight. 'It's only Logen fucking Ninefingers!' Logen's boot slid in the mud and he\nnearly pitched on his arse, had to wave his arms around all over to keep his balance.\nThe talk around the fire all sputtered out in a moment and every face was turned\ntowards him. Two long, frozen rows of them, slack in the shifting light, no sound\nbut the sighing wind and the crackling fire. The Dogman stared up at him as though\nhe was seeing the dead walk, his mouth hanging wider and wider open with every\npassing moment.\n'I thought you was all killed,' said Logen as he got his balance back. 'Guess\nthere's such a thing as being too realistic'\nDogman got to his feet, slowly. He held out his hand, and Logen took hold of it.\nThere was nothing to say. Not for men who'd been through as much as the two\nof them had together—fighting the Shanka, crossing the mountains, getting through\nthe wars, and after. Years of it. Dogman pressed his hand and Logen slapped his\nother hand on top of it, and Dogman slapped his other hand on top of that. They\ngrinned at each other, and nodded, and things were back the way they had been.\nNothing needed saying.\n'Grim. Good to see you.'\n'Uh,' grunted Grim, handing him up a mug then looking back to his shafts, just as\nthough Logen had gone for a piss a minute ago and come back a minute later like\neveryone had expected. Logen had to grin. He'd have hoped for nothing else.\n'That Black Dow hiding down there?'\n'I'd have hidden better if I knew you were coming.' Dow looked Logen up and\ndown with a grin not entirely welcoming. 'If it ain't Ninefingers his self. Thought you\nsaid he went over a cliff?' he barked at Dogman.\n'That's what I saw.'\n'Oh, I went over.' Logen remembered the wind in his mouth, the rock and the"

Logen remembered the wind in his mouth, the rock and the\nsnow turning around him, the crash as the water crushed his breath out. 'I went on\nover and I washed up whole, more or less.' Dogman made room for him on the\nstretched-out hides by the fire, and he sat down, and the others sat near him.\nDow was shaking his head. 'You always was a lucky bastard when it came to\nstaying alive. I should've known you'd turn up.'\n'I thought the Flatheads had got you all sure,' said Logen. 'How d'you get out of\nthere?'\n'Threetrees got us out,' said Dogman.\nTul nodded. 'Led us out and over the mountains, and hunted through the North,\nand all the way down into Angland.'\n'Squabbling all the way like a bunch of old women, no doubt?'\nDogman grinned across at Dow. 'There was some moaning on the trail.'\n'Where's Threetrees now, then?' Logen was looking forward to having a word\nwith that old boy.\n'Dead,' said Grim.\nLogen winced. He'd guessed that might be the way, since Dogman was in charge.\nTul nodded his big head. 'Died fighting. Leading a charge, into the Shanka. Died\nfighting that thing. That Feared.'\n'Bastard fucking thing.' And Dow hawked some spit into the mud.\n'What about Forley?'\n'Dead n'all,' barked Dow. 'He went into Carleon, to warn Bethod that the Shanka\nwere coming over the mountains. Calder had him killed, just for the sport of it.\nBastard!' And he spat again. He'd always been a great one for spitting, had Dow.\n'Dead.' Logen shook his head. Forley dead, and Threetrees dead, it was a damn\nshame. But it wasn't so long since he thought the whole lot of them were back in the\nmud, so four still going was quite the bonus, in a way. 'Well. Good men both. The\nbest, and died well, by the sound of it. As well as men can, anyway.'\n'Aye,' said Tul, lifting up a mug. 'As well as you can. Here's to the dead.'\nThey all drank in silence, and Logen smacked his lips at the taste of beer. Too\nlong away. 'So, a year gone by,' grunted Dow. 'We done some killing, and we\nwalked a damn long way, and we fought in a bastard of a battle. We lost two men\nand we got us a new chief. What the hell you been up to, Ninefingers?'\n'Well… that there is some kind of a tale.' Logen wondered what kind, exactly,\nand found he wasn't sure. 'I thought the Shanka got you all, since life's taught me to\nexpect the worst, so I went south, and I fell in with this wizard. I went a sort of\njourney with him, across the sea and far away, to find some kind of a thing, which\nwhen we got there… weren't there.' It all sounded more than a bit mad now he said\nit."

It all sounded more than a bit mad now he said\nit.\n'What kind of a thing?' asked Tul, his face all screwed up with puzzlement.\n'Do you know what?' Logen sucked at his teeth, tasting of drink. 'I can't say that I\nreally know.' They all looked at each other as if they never heard such a damn-fool\nstory, and Logen had to admit they probably hadn't. 'Still, it hardly matters now.\nTurns out life ain't quite the bastard I took it for.' And he gave Tul a friendly clap on\nthe back.\nThe Dogman puffed out his cheeks. 'Well, we're glad you're back, anyway.\nGuess you'll be taking your place again now, eh?'\n'My place?'\n'You'll be taking over, no? I mean to say, you were chief.'\n'Used to be, maybe, but I've no plans to go back to it. Seems as if these lads are\nhappy enough with things the way they are.'\n'But you know a sight more than me about leading men—'\n'I don't know that's a fact. Me being in charge never worked out too well for\nanyone, now did it? Not for us, not for those who fought with us, not for them we\nfought against.' Logen hunched his shoulders at the memories. 'I'll put my word in, if\nyou want it, but I'd sooner follow you. I did my time, and it wasn't a good one.'\nDogman looked like he'd been hoping for a different outcome. 'Well… if you're\nsure…'\n'I'm sure.' And Logen slapped him on the shoulder. 'Not easy, is it, being chief?'\n'No,' grumbled Dogman. 'It bloody ain't.'\n'Besides, I reckon a lot of these lads have been on the other side of an argument\nwith me before, and they're not altogether pleased to see me.' Logen looked down\nthe fire at the hard faces, heard the mutterings with his name in them, too quiet to tell\nthe matter for sure, but he could guess that it wasn't complimentary.\n'They'll be glad enough to have you alongside 'em when the fighting starts, don't\nworry about that.'\n'Maybe.' Seemed an awful shame that he'd have to set to killing before folk would\ngive him so much as a nod. Sharp looks came at him from out the dark, flicking\naway when he looked back. There was only one man, more or less, who met his eye.\nA big lad with long hair, halfway down the fire.\n'Who's that?' asked Logen.\n'Who's what?'\n'That lad down there staring at me.'\n'That there is Shivers.' Dogman sucked at his pointed teeth. 'He's got a lot of\nbones, Shivers. Fought with us a few times now, and he does it damn well. First of\nall I'll tell you he's a good man and we owe him. Then I ought to mention that he's\nRattleneck's son.'\nLogen felt a wave of sickness. 'He's what?'\n'His other son.'\n'The boy?'"

Boys grow up.'\nA long time ago, maybe, but nothing was forgotten. Logen could see that straight\naway. Nothing was ever forgotten, up here in the North, and he should've known\nbetter than to think it might be. 'I should say something to him. If we have to fight\ntogether… I should say something.'\nDogman winced. 'Might be better that you don't. Some wounds are best not\npicked at. Eat, and talk to him in the morning. Everything sounds fairer in the\ndaylight. That or you can decide against it.'\n'Uh,' grunted Grim.\nLogen stood up. 'You're right, most likely, but it's better to do it—'\n'Than to live with the fear of it.' Dogman nodded into the fire. 'You been missed,\nLogen, and that's a fact.'\n'You too, Dogman. You too.'\nHe walked down through the darkness, smelly with smoke and meat and men,\nalong behind the Carls sitting at the fire. He felt them hunching their shoulders,\nmuttering as he passed. He knew what they were thinking. The Bloody-Nine, right\nbehind me, and there's no worse man in the world to have your back to. He could\nsee Shivers watching him all the way, one eye cold through his long hair, lips pressed\ntogether in a hard line. He had a knife out for eating, but just as good for stabbing a\nman. Logen watched the firelight gleaming on its edge as he squatted down beside\nhim.\n'So you're the Bloody-Nine.'\nLogen grimaced. 'Aye. I reckon.'\nShivers nodded, still staring at him. 'This is what the Bloody-Nine looks like.'\n'Hope you're not disappointed.'\n'Oh no. Not me. Good to have a face on you, after all this time.'\nLogen looked down at the ground, trying to think of some way to come at it.\nSome way to move his hands, or set his face, some words that might start to make\nthe tiniest part of it right. 'Those were hard times, back then,' he ended up saying.\n'Harder'n now?'\nLogen chewed at his lip. 'Well, maybe not.'\n'Times are always hard, I reckon,' said Shivers between gritted teeth. 'That ain't\nan excuse for doing a runny shit.'\n'You're right. There ain't any excuses for what I did. I'm not proud of it. Don't\nknow what else I can say, except I hope you can put it out of the way, and we can\nfight side by side.'\n'I'll be honest with you,' said Shivers, and his voice was strangled-sounding, like\nhe was trying not to shout, or trying not to cry, or both at once, maybe. 'It's a hard\nthing to just put behind me. You killed my brother, when you'd promised him mercy,\nand you cut his arms and legs off, and you nailed his head on Bethod's standard.'\nHis knuckles were trembling white round the grip of his knife, and Logen saw that it"

He didn't\nblame him one bit. 'My father never was the same after that. He'd nothing in him any\nmore. I spent a lot of years dreaming of killing you, Bloody-Nine.'\nLogen nodded, slowly. 'Well. You'll never be alone with that dream.'\nHe caught other cold looks from across the flames, now. Frowns in the shadows,\ngrim faces in the flickering light. Men he didn't even know, afraid to their bones, or\nnursing scores against him. A whole lot of fear and a whole lot of scores. He could\ncount on the fingers of one hand the folk who were pleased to see him alive. Even\nmissing a finger. And this was supposed to be his side of the fight.\nDogman had been right. Some wounds are best not picked at. Logen got up, his\nshoulders prickling, and walked back to the head of the fire, where the talk came\neasier. He'd no doubt Shivers wanted to kill him just as much as he ever had, but that\nwas no surprise.\nYou have to be realistic.

It may be that you and I can hammer\nout between us an understanding that will leave us both with less work and more\nprogress.\nI will be waiting for you at the slaughter-yard near the Tour Corners tomorrow\nmorning from six.

It would seem that a few hundred live pigs do not smell\nso sweet as one would expect. The floor of the shadowy warehouse was slick with\ntheir stinking slurry, the thick air full of their desperate noise. They honked and\nsquealed, grunted and jostled each other in their writhing pens, sensing, perhaps, that\nthe slaughterman's knife was not so very far away. But, as Morrow had observed,\nGlokta was not one to be put off by the noise, or the knives, or, for that matter, an\nunpleasant odour. I spend my days wading through the metaphorical filth, after\nall. Why not the real thing? The slippery footing was more of a problem. He\nhobbled with tiny steps, his leg burning.

Glokta limped up beside him, boots squelching, wincing\nand breathing hard, sweat trickling down his back. 'Well, Morrow, you know just\nhow to make a girl feel special, I'll give you that.'\nMarovia's secretary grinned up at him, a small man with a round face and\neyeglasses. 'Superior Glokta, may I first say that I have nothing but the highest\nrespect for your achievements in Gurkhul, your methods in negotiation, and—'\n'I did not come here to exchange pleasantries, Morrow.

Uncertainty. Unease amongst the peasantry—'\n'A little more than unease, I would say, wouldn't you?'\n'Rebellion, then. Let us hope that the Closed Council's trust in Colonel Luthar will\nbe justified, and he will stop the rebels outside the city.'\n'I wouldn't trust his corpse to stop an arrow, but I suppose the Closed Council\nhave their reasons.'\n'They always do. Though, of course, they do not always agree with each other.'\nThey never agree about anything. It's practically a rule of the damn institution.\n'But it is those that serve them,' and Morrow peered significantly over the rims of his\neye-glasses, 'that carry the burden for their lack of accord. I feel that we, in\nparticular, have been stepping on each other's toes rather too much for either of our\ncomfort.'\n'Huh,' sneered Glokta, working his numb toes inside his boot. 'I do hope your\nfeet aren't too bruised. I could never live with myself if I caused you to limp. Might\nyou have a solution in mind?'\n'You could say that.' He smiled down at the pigs, watching them squirm and\ngrunt and clamber over one another. 'We had hogs on the farm, where I grew up.'\nMercy. Anything but the life story.

So that's it.\nIt was then that Glokta became aware of a man moving furtively towards them\nfrom the far end of the shed. A burly-looking man in a ragged coat, keeping to the\nshadows. He had his arm pressed tightly by his side, hand tucked up in his sleeve.\nJust as if he were hiding a knife up there, and not doing it very well. Better just to"

Better just to\nwalk up with a smile on your face and the knife in plain view. There are a\nhundred reasons to carry a blade in a slaughterhouse. But there can only ever be\none reason to try and hide one.\nHe glanced over his shoulder, wincing as his neck clicked. Another man, much\nlike the first, was creeping up from that direction. Glokta raised his eyebrows.\n'Thugs? How very unoriginal.'\n'Unoriginal, perhaps, but I think you will find them quite effective.'\n'So I'm to be slaughtered in the slaughterhouse, eh, Morrow? Butchered at the\nbutchers! Sand dan Glokta, breaker of hearts, winner of the Contest, hero of the\nGurkish war, shat out the arses of a dozen different pigs!' He snorted with laughter\nand had to wipe some snot off his top lip.\n'I'm so glad you enjoy the irony,' muttered Morrow, looking slightly put out.\n'Oh, I do. Fed to the swine. So obvious I can honestly say it's not what I\nexpected.' He gave a long sigh. 'But not expected and not planned for are two quite\ndifferent things.'\nThe bowstring made no sound over the clamour of the hogs. The thug seemed at\nfirst to slip, to drop his shining knife and fall on his side for no reason. Then Glokta\nsaw the bolt poking from his side. Not too great a surprise, of course, and yet it\nalways seems like magic.\nThe hired man at the other end of the warehouse took a shocked step back, never\nseeing Practical Vitari slip silently over the rail of the empty pen behind him. There\nwas a flash of metal in the darkness as she slashed the tendons at the back of his\nknee and brought him down, his cry quickly shut off as she pulled her chain tight\nround his neck.\nSeverard dropped down easily from the rafters off to Glokta's left and squelched\ninto the muck. He sauntered over, flatbow across his shoulder, kicked the fallen\nknife off into the darkness and looked down at the man he had shot. 'I owe you five\nmarks,' he called to Frost. 'Missed his heart, damn it. Liver, maybe?'\n'Lither,' grunted the albino, emerging from the shadows at the far end of the\nwarehouse. The man struggled up to his knees, clutching at the shaft through his\nside, twisted face half crusted with filth. Frost lifted his stick as he passed and dealt\nhim a crunching blow on the back of the head, putting a sharp end to his cries and\nknocking him face down in the muck. Vitari, meanwhile, had wrestled her man onto\nthe floor and was kneeling on his back, dragging at the chain round his neck. His\nstruggling grew weaker, and weaker, and stopped. A little more dead meat on the\nfloor of the slaughterhouse.\nGlokta looked back to Morrow. 'How quickly things can change, eh, Harlen?\nOne minute everyone wants to know you. The next?' He tapped sadly at his useless\nfoot with the filthy toe of his cane. 'You're fucked. It's a tough lesson.' I should\nknow."

I should\nknow.\nMarovia's secretary backed away, tongue darting over his lips, one hand held out\nin front of him. 'Now hold on—'\n'Why?' Glokta pushed out his bottom lip. 'Do you really think we can grow to\nlove each other again after all this?'\n'Perhaps we can come to some—'\n'I'm not upset that you tried to kill me. But to make such a pathetic effort at it?\nWe're professionals, Morrow. It's an insult, that you thought this might work.'\n'I'm hurt,' muttered Severard.\n'Wounded,' sang Vitari, chain jingling in the darkness.\n'Deethly othended,' grunted Frost, herding Morrow back towards the pen.\n'You should have stuck to licking Hoffs big drunk arse. Or maybe you should\nhave stayed on the farm, with your pigs. Tough work, perhaps, in the early morning,\nand so on. But it's a living.'\n'Just wait! Just wuurgh—'\nSeverard grabbed Morrow's shoulder from behind, stabbed him through the side\nof his neck and chopped his throat out as calmly as if he was gutting a fish.\nBlood showered over Glokta's boots and he stumbled back, wincing as pain shot\nup his ruined leg. 'Shit!' he hissed through his gums, nearly stumbling and falling on\nhis arse in the filth, only managing to stay upright by clinging desperately to the fence\nbeside him. 'Couldn't you just have strangled him?'\nSeverard shrugged. 'Same result, isn't it?' Morrow slid to his knees, eye-glasses\nskewed across his face, one hand clutching at his cut neck while blood bubbled out\ninto his shirt collar.\nGlokta watched the clerk tip onto his back, one leg kicking at the floor, his\nscraping heel leaving long streaks in the stinking muck. Alas for the pigs on the\nfarm. They will never now see young master Morrow coming back over the hill,\nreturned from his brave life in the glittering city, his breath smoking in the cold,\ncold morning…\nThe secretary's convulsions grew gentler, and gentler, and he lay still. Glokta\nclung to the rail for a moment, watching the corpse. When was it exactly that I\nbecame… this? By small degrees, I suppose. One act presses hard upon another,\non a path we have no choice but to follow, and each time there are reasons. We do\nwhat we must, we do what we are told, we do what is easiest. What else can we do\nbut solve one sordid problem at a time? Then one day we look up and find that we\nare… this.\nHe looked at the blood gleaming on his boot, wrinkled his nose and wiped it off\non Morrow's trouser leg. Ah, well. I would love to spend more time on philosophy,\nbut I have officials to bribe, and noblemen to blackmail, and votes to rig, and\nsecretaries to murder, and lovers to threaten. So many knives to juggle. And as one\nclatters to the filthy floor, another must go up, blade spinning razor sharp above"

It never gets any easier.\n'Our magical friends are back in town.'\nSeverard lifted his mask and scratched behind it. 'The Magi?'\n'The First of the bastards, no less, and his bold company of heroes. Him, and his\nslinking apprentice, and that woman. The Navigator too. Keep an eye on them, and\nsee if there's a piglet we can separate from the herd. It's high time we knew what they\nwere about. Do you still have your charming house, by the water?'\n'Of course.'\n'Good. Perhaps for once we can get ahead of the game, and when his Eminence\ndemands answers we can have them to hand.' And I can finally earn a pat on the\nhead from my master.\n'What shall we do with these?' asked Vitari, jerking her spiky head towards the\ncorpses.\nGlokta sighed. 'The hogs will eat anything, apparently.'\nThe city was growing dark as Glokta dragged his ruined leg through the emptying\nstreets and up towards the Agriont. The shopkeepers were closing their doors, the\nhouseholders were lighting their lamps, candlelight spilling out into the dusky\nalleyways through chinks around the shutters. Happy families settling down to\nhappy dinners, no doubt. Loving fathers with their lovely wives, their adorable\nchildren, their full and meaningful lives. My heartfelt congratulations.\nHe pressed his remaining teeth into his sore gums with the effort of maintaining\nhis pace, sweat starting to dampen his shirt, his leg burning more and more with\nevery lurching step. But I'm not stopping for this useless lump of dead meat. The\npain crept up from ankle to knee, from knee to hip, from hip all the way up his\ntwisted spine and into his skull. All this effort just to kill a mid-level administrator,\nwho worked no more than a few buildings away from the House of Questions in\nany case. It's a damn waste of my time, is what it is, it's a damn—\n'Superior Glokta?'\nA man had stepped up, respectfully, his face in shadow. Glokta squinted at him.\n'Do I—'\nIt was well done, there was no denying it. He was not even aware of the other\nman until the bag was over his head and one of his arms was twisted behind his\nback, pushing him helplessly forward. He stumbled, fumbled his cane and heard it\nclatter to the cobbles.\n'Aargh!' A searing spasm shot through his back as he tried unsuccessfully to drag\nhis arm free, and he was forced to hang limp, gasping with pain inside the bag. In a\nmoment they had his wrists tied and he felt a powerful hand shoved under each of\nhis armpits. He was marched away with great speed, one man on each side, his feet\nbarely scraping on the cobbles as they went. The fastest I've walked in a good long\nwhile, anyway. Their grip was not rough, but it was irresistible. Professionals. An\naltogether better class of thug than Morrow stretched to. Whoever ordered this is\nno fool. So who did order it?"

Anyone on the entire Open Council?\nOr could it be the Gurkish? They have never been my closest friends. The banking\nhouse of Valint and Balk, perhaps, chosen finally to call in their debt? Might I\nhave seriously misjudged young Captain Luthar, even? Or could it simply be\nSuperior Goyle, no longer keen to share his job with the cripple? It was quite the\nlist, now that he was forced to consider it.\nHe heard the footfalls slapping around him. Narrow alleys. He had no idea how\nfar they had come. His breath echoed in the bag, rasping, throaty. The heart\nthumps, the skin prickles with cold sweat. Excited. Scared, even. What might they\nwant with me? People are not snatched from the street in order to be given\npromotions, or confections, or tender kisses, more's the pity. I know why people are\nsnatched from the street. Few better.\nDown a set of steps, the toes of his boots scuffing helplessly against the treads.\nThe sound of a heavy door being heaved shut. Footsteps echoing in a tiled corridor.\nAnother door closing. He felt himself dumped unceremoniously in a chair. And now,\nno doubt, for better or worse, we shall find out…\nThe bag was snatched suddenly from his head and Glokta blinked as harsh light\nstabbed at his eyes. A white room, too bright for comfort. A type of room with\nwhich I am sadly familiar. And yet it looks so much uglier from this side of the\ntable. Someone was sitting opposite. Or the blurry outline of a someone. He closed\none eye and peered through the other as his vision adjusted.\n'Well,' he murmured. 'What a surprise.'\n'A pleasant one, I hope.'\n'I suppose we'll see.' Carlot dan Eider had changed. And it would seem that exile\nhas not entirely disagreed with her. Her hair had grown back, not all the way,\nperhaps, but more than far enough to manage a fetching style. The bruises round her\nthroat had faded, there were only the very faintest of marks where her cheek had\nbeen covered in scabs. She had swapped traitor's sack-cloth for the travelling\nclothes of a lady of means, and looked extremely well in them. Jewels twinkled on\nher fingers, and around her neck. She seemed every bit as rich and sleek as when\nthey first met. That, and she was smiling. The smile of the player who holds all the\ncards. Why is it that I cannot learn? Never do a good turn. Especially not for a\nwoman.\nA small pair of scissors lay on the table before her, within easy reach. Of the type\nthat rich women use to trim their nails.

'I thought I told you never to come back,'\nhe said, but his voice lacked its customary authority.\n'You did. But then I thought… why ever not? I have assets in the city that I was\nnot willing to relinquish, and some business opportunities that I am keen to take\nadvantage of.' She took up the scissors, trimmed the thinnest scrap from the corner\nof one already perfectly-shaped thumbnail, and frowned at the results. 'And it's\nhardly as though you'll be telling anyone I'm here, now, is it?'\n'My concerns for your safety are all laid to rest,' grunted Glokta. My concerns for\nmy own, alas, grow with every moment. A man is never so crippled, after all, that\nhe could not be more so. 'Did you really need to go to all this trouble just to share\nyour travel arrangements?'\nHer smile grew somewhat broader, if anything. 'I hope my men didn't hurt you. I\ndid ask them to be gentle. At least for the time being.'\n'A gentle kidnapping is still a kidnapping, though, don't you find?'\n'Kidnapping is such an ugly word. Why don't we think of it as an invitation\ndifficult to resist? At least I let you keep your clothes, no?'\n'That particular favour is a mercy to us both, believe me. An invitation to what,\nmight I ask, beyond a painful manhandling and a brief conversation?'\n'I'm hurt that you need more. But there was something else, since you mention it.'\nShe pared away another sliver of nail with her scissors, and her eyes rolled up to his.\n'A little debt left over, from Dagoska. I fear that I will not sleep easily until it is\nrepaid.'\nA few weeks in a black cell and a choking to the point of death? What form of\nrepayment might that earn me? 'Please, then,' hissed Glokta through his gums, his\neyelid flickering as he watched those blades snip, snip, snip. 'I can scarcely stand the\nsuspense.'\n'The Gurkish are coming.'\nHe paused for a moment, wrong-footed. 'Coming here?'\n'Yes. To Midderland. To Adua. To you. They have built a fleet, in secret. They\nbegan building it after the last war, and now it is complete. Ships to rival anything the\nUnion has.' She tossed her scissors down on the table and gave a long sigh. 'Or so I\nhear.'\nThe Gurkish fleet, just as my midnight visitor Yulwei told me. Rumours and\nghosts, perhaps. But rumours are not always lies. 'When will they arrive?'\n'I really couldn't say. The mounting of such an expedition is a colossal work of\norganisation. But then the Gurkish have always been so very much better organised\nthan us. That's what makes doing business with them such a pleasure.'\nMy own dealings with them have been less than delightful, but still. 'In what\nnumbers will they come?'\n'A very great number, I imagine.'"

'Forgive me if I regard the words of a proven traitor with a\ncertain scepticism, especially as you are rather thin on the details.'\n'Have it your way. You're here to be warned, not convinced. I owe you that\nmuch, I think, for giving me my life.'\nHow wonderfully old-fashioned of you. 'And that is all?'\nShe spread her hands. 'Can a lady not trim her nails without giving offence?'\n'Could you not simply have written?' snapped Glokta, 'and spared me the chafing\non my under-arms?'\n'Oh, come now. You never struck me as a man to bridle at a little chafing.\nBesides, it has given us the chance to renew a thoroughly enjoyable friendship. And\nyou have to allow me my little moment of triumph, after what you put me through.'\nI suppose that I can. I've had less charming threats, and at least she has better\ntaste than to meet in a pig sty. 'I can simply walk away, then?'\n'Did anyone pick up a cane?' No one spoke. Eider gave a happy smile, showing\nGlokta her perfect white teeth. 'You can crawl away, then. How does that sound?'\nBetter than floating to the top of the canal after a few days on the bottom,\nbloated up like a great pale slug and smelling like all the graves in the city. 'As\ngood as I'll get, I suppose. I do wonder, though. What is to stop me having my\nPracticals follow the scent of expensive perfume after we are done here and finish\nwhat they started?'\n'It is so very like you to say such a thing.' She sighed. 'I should inform you that\nan old and trustworthy business acquaintance of mine has a sealed letter in his\npossession. In the event of my death, it will be sent to the Arch Lector, laying out to\nhim the exact nature of my sentence in Dagoska.'\nGlokta sucked sourly at his gums. Just what I need, another knife to juggle.\n'And what will occur if, entirely independently from my actions, you succumb to the\nrot? Or a house falls on you? Or you choke on a slice of bread?'\nShe opened her eyes very wide, as though the thought had only just occurred. 'In\nany of those cases… I suppose… the letter would be sent anyway, despite your\ninnocence.' She gave a helpless laugh. 'The world is nothing like as fair a place as it\nshould be, in my opinion, and I daresay that the natives of Dagoska, the enslaved\nmercenaries, and the butchered Union soldiers who you made fight for your lost\ncause would concur.' She smiled as sweetly as if they were discussing gardening.\n'Things would probably have been far simpler for you if you'd had me strangled,\nafter all.'\n'You read my mind.' But it is far too late now. I did a good thing, and so, of\ncourse, there is a price to be paid.\n'So tell me, before we part ways again, for what, we can both only hope, will be"

'Who will be the next king of the Union, do you\nsuppose? Will it be Brock? Isher? Will it be someone else?'\n'A little early to say. I'm working on it.'\n'Off you hobble, then.'

It offered a splendid\nview of the shallow valley below. At least, it would have been a splendid view in\nhappier times. As things stood, it had to be admitted, the spectacle was far from\npleasant.\nThe main body of the rebels entirely covered several large fields further down the\nvalley, and a dark, and grubby, and threatening infestation they seemed, glinting in\nplaces with bright steel. Farming implements and tradesman's tools, perhaps, but\nsharp ones.\nEven at this distance there was disturbing evidence of organisation. Straight,\nregular gaps through the men for the quick movement of messengers and supplies. It\nwas plain, even to Jezal's unpractised eye, that this was as much an army as a mob,\nand that someone down there knew his business. A great deal better than he did,\nmost likely.\nSmaller, less organised groups of rebels were scattered far and wide across the\nlandscape, each one a considerable body in its own right. Men sent foraging for\nfood and water, picking the country clean. That crawling black mass on the green\nfields reminded Jezal of a horde of black ants crawling over a pile of discarded apple\npeelings. He had not the slightest idea how many of them there were, but it looked at\nthis distance as though forty thousand might have been a considerable\nunderestimate.\nDown in the village in the bottom of the valley, behind the main mass of rebels,\nfires were burning. Bonfires or buildings it was hard to say, but Jezal rather feared\nthe latter. Three tall columns of dark smoke rose up and drifted apart high above,\ngiving to the air a faint and worrying tang of fire.\nIt was a commander's place to set a tone of fearlessness which his men would\nnot be able to help but follow. Jezal knew that, of course. And yet, looking down\nthat long, sloping field, he could not help but reflect on the very great number of men\nat the other end, so ominously purposeful. He could not stop his eyes from darting\nback towards their own lines, so thin, meagre, and uncertain-seeming. He could not\navoid wincing and tugging uncomfortably at his collar. The damn thing still felt far\ntoo tight."

The damn thing still felt far\ntoo tight.\n'How do you wish the regiments deployed, sir?' asked his adjutant, Major Opker,\nwith a look which somehow managed to be both condescending and sycophantic all\nat once.\n'Deployed? Er… well…' Jezal racked his brains for something vaguely\nappropriate, let alone correct, to say. He had discovered early in his military career\nthat if one has an effective and experienced officer above, coupled with effective and\nexperienced soldiers below, one need do, and know, nothing. This strategy had\nstood him in fine stead for several comfortable peacetime years, but its one\nshortcoming was now starkly laid bare. If by some miracle one rises to complete\ncommand, the system collapses entirely.\n'Deployed…' he growled, furrowing his brow and trying to give the impression he\nwas surveying the ground, though he had only a hazy idea what that even meant.\n'Infantry in double line…' he ventured, remembering a fragment of some story\nCollem West had once told him. 'Behind this hedgerow here.' And he slashed his\nbaton portentously across the landscape. The use of a baton, at least, he was expert\nin, having practiced extensively before the mirror.\n'In front of the hedgerow, the Colonel means to say, of course,' threw in Bayaz\nsmoothly. 'Infantry deployed in double line to either side of that milestone. The light\ncavalry in the trees there, heavy cavalry in a wedge on the far flank, where they can\nuse the open field to their advantage.' He displayed an uncanny familiarity with\nmilitary parlance. 'Flatbows in a single line behind the hedgerow where they will at\nfirst be hidden from the enemy, and can give them plunging fire from the high\nground.' He winked at Jezal. 'An excellent strategy, Colonel, if I may say.'\n'Of course,' sneered Opker, turning away to give the orders.\nJezal gripped tight to his baton behind his back, rubbing nervously at his jaw with\nthe other hand. Evidently there was a lot more to command than simply being called\n'sir' by everyone. He would really have to read some books when he got back to\nAdua. If he got back.\nThree small dots had detached themselves from the crawling mass of humanity\ndown in the valley and started moving up the rise toward them. Shading his eyes with\nhis hand, Jezal could just see a shred of white moving in the air above them. A flag\nof parley. He felt Bayaz' decidedly uncomforting hand on his shoulder.\n'Don't worry, my boy, we are well prepared for violence. But I feel confident it\nwill not come to that.' He grinned down at the vast mass of men below. 'Very\nconfident.'\nJezal ardently wished he could have said the same.\nFor a famous demagogue, traitor, and inciter of riots, there was nothing in the least\nremarkable about the man known as the Tanner.

'I am Colonel Luthar.'\n'I know. I saw you win the Contest. Fine swordplay, my friend, very fine.'\n'Oh, well, er…' Jezal was caught off guard, 'thank you. This is my adjutant, Major\nOpker, and this is… Bayaz, the First of the Magi.'\nGoodman Hood snorted his disbelief, but the Tanner only stroked thoughtfully at\nhis lip. 'Good. And you have come to fight, or negotiate?'\n'We have come for either one.' Jezal embarked on his statement. 'The Closed\nCouncil, while condemning the method of your demonstration, concede that you\nmay have legitimate demands—'\nHood made a rumbling snort. 'What choice have they got, the bastards?'\nJezal pressed on. 'Well, er… they have instructed me to offer you these\nconcessions.' He held up the scroll that Hoff had prepared for him, a huge thing with\nelaborately carved handles and a seal the size of a saucer. 'But I must caution you,'\ndoing his very best to sound confident, 'should you refuse, we are quite ready to\nfight, and that my men are the best trained, best armed, best prepared in the King's\nservice. Each one of them is worth twenty of your rabble.'\nThe burly farmer gave a threatening chuckle. 'Lord Finster thought the same, and\nour rabble kicked his arse all the way from one end of his estates to the other. He\nwould have got himself hung for his trouble if he'd had a slower horse. How fast is\nyour horse, Colonel?'\nThe Tanner touched him gently on the shoulder. 'Peace, now, my fiery friend. We\ncame to get terms, if we can get terms we can accept. Why not show us what you\nhave there, Colonel, and we'll see if there is any need for threats.'\nJezal held out the weighty document and Hood snatched it angrily from his hand,\ntore it open and began to read, the thick paper crackling as it unrolled. The more he\nread, the grimmer grew his frown.\n'An insult!' he snapped when he was done, giving Jezal a brooding stare. 'Lighter"

He had not the leanest understanding of the concessions or their possible\nshortcomings, of course, but Hood's response hardly seemed to promise an early\nagreement.\nThe Tanner's eyes moved lazily over the parchment. Different-coloured eyes,\nJezal noticed: one blue, one green. When he got to the bottom he laid the document\ndown and gave a theatrical sigh. 'These terms will do.'\n'They will?' Jezal's eyes opened wide with surprise, but nowhere near as far as\nGoodman Hood's.\n'But these are worse than the last terms we were offered!' shouted the farmer.\n'Before we sent Finster's men running!

'What happened to honest\nwages for honest work? What happened to shares in the profit? What happened to\nequal rights no matter the cost? You stood there, and you promised me!'

They follow me, Hood, not you, in case\nyou hadn't noticed.'\n'But you promised us freedom, for every man! I trusted you!' The farmer's face\nhung slack with horror. 'We all trusted you.'\nJezal had never seen a man look so utterly indifferent as the Tanner did now. 'I\nsuppose I must have that kind of face that people trust,' he droned, and his friend\nHoist shrugged and stared at his fingernails.\n'Damn you, then! Damn you all!' And Hood turned and shoved angrily out\nthrough the tent flap.\nJezal was aware of Bayaz leaning sideways to whisper to Major Opker. 'Have that\nman arrested before he leaves the lines.'\n'Arrested, my Lord, but… under a flag of parley?'\n'Arrested, placed in irons, and conducted to the House of Questions. A shred of\nwhite cloth can be no hiding place from the King's justice. I believe Superior Goyle\nis handling the investigations.'\n'Er… of course.' Opker rose to follow the Goodman out of the tent, and Jezal\nsmiled nervously. There was no doubt that the Tanner had heard the exchange, but\nhe grinned on as though the future of his erstwhile companion was no longer any of\nhis concern.\n'I must apologise for my associate. In a matter like this, you can't please\neveryone.' He gave a flamboyant wave of his hand. 'But don't worry. I'll give the little\npeople a big speech, and tell them we have all we fought for, and they'll soon be off\nback to their homes with no real harm done. Some few will be determined to make"

Never the\nslightest peace.' He exchanged a long glance with Bayaz, then ducked out into the\ndaylight and was gone.\n'If anyone should ask,' murmured the First of the Magi in Jezal's ear, 'I would tell\nthem that it was a testing negotiation, against sharp and determined opponents, but\nthat you held your nerve, reminded them of their duty to king and country, implored\nthem to return to their fields, and so forth.'\n'But…' Jezal felt like he wanted to cry, he was so baffled.

There's a certain look the beaten get, after a fight. Slow-moving,\nhunched-up, mud-spattered, mightily interested in the ground. Dogman had seen that\nlook before often enough. He'd had it himself more'n once. Sorrowful they'd lost.\nShamed they'd been beaten. Guilty, to have given up without getting a wound.\nDogman knew how that felt, and a gnawing feeling it could be, but guilt was a sight\nless painful than a sword-cut, and healed a sight quicker.\nSome of the hurt weren't so badly off. Bandaged or splinted, limping with a stick\nor with their arm round a mate's shoulders. Enough to get light duty for a few weeks.\nOthers weren't so lucky. Dogman thought he knew one. An officer, hardly old\nenough for a beard, his smooth face all twisted up with white pain and shock, his leg\noff just above the knee, his clothes, and the stretcher, and the two men carrying him,\nall specked and spattered with dark blood. He was the one who'd sat on the gate,\nwhen Dogman and Threetrees had first come to Ostenhorm to join up with the\nUnion. The one who'd looked at 'em like they were a pair of turds. He didn't sound\nso very clever now, squealing with every jolt of his stretcher, but it hardly made the\nDogman smile. Losing a leg seemed like harsh punishment for a sneering manner.\nWest was down there by the path, talking to an officer with a dirty bandage round\nhis head. Dogman couldn't hear what they were saying, but he could guess the gist.\nFrom time to time one of 'em would point up towards the hills they'd come from. A"

A\nsteep and nasty-looking pair, wooded mostly, with a few hard faces of bare rock\nshowing. West turned and caught the Dogman's eye, and his face was grim as a\ngravedigger's. It hardly took a quick mind to see that the war weren't won quite yet.\n'Shit,' muttered the Dogman, under his breath. He felt that sucking feeling in his\ngut. That low feeling he used to get whenever he had to scout out a new piece of\nground, whenever Threetrees called for weapons, whenever there was nothing for\nbreakfast but cold water.\nSince he was chief, though, he seemed to have it pretty much all the time.\nEverything was his problem now. 'Nothing doing?'\nWest shook his head as he walked up. 'Bethod was waiting for us, and in\nnumbers. He's dug in on those hills. Well dug in and well prepared, between us and\nCarleon. More than likely he was ready for this before he even crossed the border.'\n'He always did like to be ready, did Bethod. No way round him?'\n'Kroy's tried both the roads and had two maulings. Now Poulder's tried the hills\nhead on and had a worse one.'\nDogman sighed. 'No way round.'\n'No way that won't give Bethod a nice chance to stick the knife right into us.'\n'And Bethod won't be missing no chance like that. It's what he'll be hoping for.'\n'The Lord Marshal agrees. He wants you to take your men north.' West glared\nout at the grey whispers of other hills, further off. 'He wants you to look for a\nweakness. There's no way Bethod can cover the whole range.'\n'Is there not?' asked Dogman. 'I guess we'll see.' Then he headed off into the\ntrees. The boys were going to love this.\nHe strode up the track, soon came up on where his crew were camped out. They\nwere growing all the time. Might've been four hundred now, all counted, and a tough\ncrowd too. Those who'd never much cared for Bethod in the first place, mostly,\nwho'd fought against him in the wars. Who'd fought against the Dogman as well, for\nthat matter. The woods were choked up with 'em, sat round fires, cooking, polishing\nat weapons and working at gear, a couple having a practice at each other with\nblades. Dogman winced at the sound of steel clashing. There'd be more of that later,\nand with bloodier results, he didn't doubt.\n'Chief!' they shouted at him. 'Dogman! The chief! Hey hey!' They clapped their\nhands and tapped their weapons on the rocks they sat on. Dogman held up his fist,\nand gave the odd half-grin, and said 'aye, good, good,' and all that. He still didn't\nhave the slightest clue how to act like a chief, if the truth be told, so he just acted like\nhe always had. The band all seemed happy enough, though. He guessed they always\ndid. Until they started losing fights, and decided they wanted a new chief."

Tul saw him coming. 'The Dogman's back.'\n'Uh,' said Grim, trimming at some feathers with a razor.\nDow was busy mopping grease out of a pan with a chunk o' bread.\n'How'd the Union get on with them hills, then?' And he had a sneer to his voice\nthat said he knew the answer already. 'Make a shit from it, did they?'\n'Well, they came out second, if that's what you're asking.'\n'Second o' two sides is what I call shit.'\nDogman took a deep breath and let it pass. 'Bethod's dug in good, watching the\nroads to Carleon. No one can see an easy way to come at him, or an easy way\naround him neither. He was good and ready for this, I reckon.'\n'I could've bloody told you that!' barked Dow, spraying out greasy crumbs. 'He'll\nhave Littlebone on one o' them hills, and Whitesides on the other, then he'll have\nPale-as-Snow and Goring further out. Those four won't be giving anyone any\nchances, but if they decide to, Bethod'll be sat behind with the rest, and his Shanka,\nand his fucking Feared, ready to snuff 'em out double-time.'\n'More'n likely.' Tul held his sword up to the light, peered at it, then set to\npolishing up the blade again. 'Always liked to have a plan, did Bethod.'\n'And what do them that hold our leash have to say?' sneered Dow. 'What sort of\nwork's the Furious got for his animals?'\n'Burr wants us to move north a way, through the woods, see if Bethod's left a\nweak spot up there.'\n'Huh,' snorted Dow. 'Bethod ain't in the habit of leaving holes. Not unless he's left\none he means for us to fall into. Fall into and break our necks.'\n'Well I guess we'd better be careful where we tread then, eh?'\n'More bloody errands.'\nDogman reckoned he was getting about as sick of Dow's moaning as Threetrees\nused to be. 'And just what else would it be, eh? That's what life is. A bunch of\nerrands. If you're worth a shit you do your best at 'em. What's got up your arse\nanyway?'\n'This!' Dow jerked his head into the trees. 'Just this! Nothing's changed that\nmuch, has it? We might be over the Whiteflow, and back in the North, but Bethod's\ndug in good and proper up there, with no way for the Union to get round him that\nwon't leave their arses hanging out.

Time'll come, the Union will have had their fill and they'll\npiss off south and leave us to it. Then Bethod's going to turn around, and what\nd'you know? He'll be the one chasing us all the way across the fucking North and\nback. Winter, summer, winter, summer, and it's more of the same old shit. Here we\nare, fewer of us than there used to be, but still pissing around in the woods. Feel\nfamiliar?'\nIt did, somewhat, now it was mentioned, but Dogman didn't see what he could\ndo about it. 'Logen's back, now, eh? That'll help.'\nDow snorted again. 'Hah! Just when did the Bloody-Nine bring anything but\ndeath along with him?'\n'Steady now,' grunted Tul. 'You owe him, remember? We all do.'\n'There's a limit on what a man should owe, I reckon.' Dow tossed his pan down\nby the fire and stood up, wiping his hands on his coat. 'Where's he been, eh? He left\nus up in the valleys without a word, didn't he? Left us to the Flatheads and pissed\noff halfway across the world! Who's to say he won't wander off again, if it suits him,\nor go over to Bethod, or set to murder over nothing, or the dead know what?'\nDogman looked at Tul, and Tul looked back, guilty. They'd all seen Logen do\nsome damn dark work, when the mood was on him. 'That was a long time ago,' said\nTul. 'Things change.'\nDow only grinned. 'No. They don't. Tell yourselves that tale if it makes you sleep\neasier, but I'll be keeping one eye open, I can tell you that! It's the Bloody-Nine we're\ntalking of. Who knows what he'll do next?'\n'I've one idea.' The Dogman turned round and saw Logen, leaning up against a\ntree, and he was starting to smile when he saw the look in his eye. A look Dogman\nremembered from way back, and dragged all kind of ugly memories up after it. That\nlook the dead have, when the life's gone out of 'em, and they care for nothing any\nmore.\n'You got a thing to say then you can say it to my face, I reckon.' Logen walked\nup, right up close to Dow, with his head falling on one side, scars all pale on his\nhanging-down face. The Dogman felt the hairs on his arms standing up, cold feeling\neven though the sun was warm.\n'Come on, Logen,' wheedled Tul, trying to sound like the whole business was all\na laugh when it was plain as a slow death it was no such thing. 'Dow didn't mean\nnothing by it. He's just—'\nLogen spoke right over him, staring Dow in the face with his corpse's eyes all the\nlong while.

'I thought when I gave you the last lesson that you'd never need another.\nBut I guess some folk have short memories.' He came in even closer, so close that\ntheir faces were almost touching. 'Well? You need a learning, boy?'\nDogman winced, sure as sure they'd set to killing one another, and how the hell\nhe'd stop 'em once they started he hadn't the faintest clue. A tense moment all round,\nit seemed to last for ever. He wouldn't have taken that from any other man, alive or\ndead, Black Dow, not even Threetrees, but in the end he just split a yellow grin.\n'Nah. One lesson's all I need.' And he turned his head sideways, hawked up and\nspat onto the ground. Then he backed off, no hurry, that grin still on his face, like he\nwas saying he'd take a telling this time, maybe, but he might not the next.\nOnce he was gone, and no blood spilled, Tul blew out hard like they'd got away\nwith murder. 'Right then. North, was it? Someone better get the lads ready to move.'\n'Uh,' said Grim, sliding the last arrow into his quiver and following him off\nthrough the trees.\nLogen stood there for a moment, watching 'em walk. When they'd got away out\nof sight he turned round, and he squatted down by the fire, hunched over with his\narms resting on his knees and his hands dangling. 'Thank the dead for that. I nearly\nshit myself.'\nDogman realised he'd been holding onto his breath the whole while, and he let it\nrush out in a gasp. 'I think I might've, just a bit. Did you have to do that?'\n'You know I did. Let a man like Dow take liberties and he won't ever stop. Then\nall the rest of these lads will get the idea that the Bloody-Nine ain't anything like so\nfrightening as they heard, and it'll be a matter of time before someone with a grudge\ndecides to take a blade to me.'\nDogman shook his head. 'That's a hard way of thinking about things.'\n'That's the way they are. They haven't changed any. They never do.'\nTrue, maybe, but they weren't ever going to change if no one gave 'em half a\nchance. 'Still. You sure all that's needful?'\n'Not for you maybe. You got that knack that folk like you.' Logen scratched at\nhis jaw, looking sadly off into the woods. 'Reckon I missed my chance at that about\nfifteen years ago. And I ain't getting another.'\nThe woods were warm and familiar. Birds twittered in the branches, not caring a\ndamn for Bethod, or the Union, or any o' the doings of men. Nowhere had ever\nseemed more peaceful, and Dogman didn't like that one bit. He sniffed at the air,\nsifting it through his nose, over his tongue. He was double careful these days, since\nthat shaft came over and killed Cathil in the battle. Might have been he could've\nsaved her, if he'd trusted his own nose a mite more. He wished he had saved her.\nBut wishing don't help any."

'Smells like—'\nAn arrow flitted up out of the trees, clicked into the tree trunk just beside\nDogman and stuck there, quivering.\n'Shit!' he squealed, sliding down on his arse and fumbling his own bow off his\nshoulder, much too late as always. Dow slithered down cursing beside him and they\ngot all tangled up with each other. Dogman nearly got his eye poked out on Dow's\naxe before he managed to push him off. He shoved his palm out at the men behind\nto say stop, but they were already scattering for cover, crawling for trees and rocks\non their bellies, pulling out weapons and staring into the woods.\nA voice drifted over from the forest ahead. 'You with Bethod?' Whoever it was\nspoke Northern with some strange-sounding accent.\nDow and Dogman looked at each other for a minute, then shrugged. 'No!' Dow\nroared back. 'And if you are, you'd best make ready to meet the dead!'\nA pause. 'We're not with that bastard, and never will be!'\n'Good enough!' shouted Dogman, putting his head up no more'n an inch, his bow\nfull drawn and ready in his hands. 'Show yourselves, then!'\nA man stepped out from behind a tree maybe six strides distant. Dogman was\nthat shocked he nearly fumbled the string and let the shaft fly. More men started\nsliding out of the woods all round. Dozens of 'em. Their hair was tangled, their faces\nwere smeared with streaks of brown dirt and blue paint, their clothes were ragged fur\nand half-tanned hides, but the heads of their spears, and the points of their arrows,\nand the blades of their rough-forged swords all shone bright and clean.\n'Hillmen,' Dogman muttered.\n'Hillmen we are, and proud of it!' A great big voice, echoing out from the woods.\nA few of 'em started to shuffle to one side, like they were making way for someone.\nDogman blinked. There was a child coming between them. A girl, maybe ten years\nold, with dirty bare feet. She had a huge hammer over one shoulder, a thick length of\nwood a stride long with a scarred lump of iron the size of a brick for a head. Far and\naway too big for her to swing. It was giving her some trouble even holding it up.\nA little boy came next. He had a round shield across his back, much too wide for\nhim, and a great axe he was lugging along in both hands. Another boy was at his\nshoulder with a spear twice as high as he was, the bright point waving around above\nhis head, gold twinkling under the blade in the strips of sunlight. He kept having to\nlook up to make sure he didn't catch it on a branch.\n'I'm dreaming,' muttered the Dogman. 'Aren't I?'"

'If y'are it's a strange one.'\nThey weren't alone, the three children. Some huge bastard was coming up\nbehind. He had a ragged fur round his great wide shoulders, and some big necklace\nhanging down on his great fat belly. A load of bones. Fingerbones, the Dogman saw\nas he got closer. Men's fingers, mixed up with flat bits of wood, strange signs cut\ninto them. He had a great yellow grin hacked out from his grey-brown beard, but that\ndidn't put the Dogman any more at ease.\n'Oh shit,' groaned Dow, 'let's go back. Back south and enough o' this.'\n'Why? You know him?'\nDow turned his head and spat. 'Crummock-i-Phail, ain't it.'\nDogman almost wished it had turned out to be an ambush, now, rather than a\nchat. It was a fact that every child knew. Crummock-i-Phail, chief of the hillmen, was\nabout the maddest bastard in the whole damn North.\nHe pushed the spears and the arrows gently out of his way as he came. 'No need\nfor that now, is there, my beauties? We're all friends, or got the same enemies, at\nleast, which is far better, d'you see? We all have a lot of enemies up in them hills,\ndon't we, though? The moon knows I love a good fight, but coming at them great\nbig rocks, with Bethod and all his arse-lickers stuck in tight on top? That's a bit too\nmuch fight for anyone, eh? Even your new Southern friends.'\nHe stopped just in front of them, fingerbones swinging and rattling. The three\nchildren stopped behind him, fidgeting with their great huge weapons and frowning\nup at Dow and the Dogman.\n'I'm Crummock-i-Phail,' he said. 'Chief of all the hillmen. Or all the ones as are\nworth a shit.' He grinned as though he'd just turned up to a wedding. 'And who\nmight be in charge o' this merry outing?'\nDogman felt that hollow feeling again, but there was nothing for it. 'That'd be me.'\nCrummock raised his brows at him. 'Would it now?

Crummock stretched his neck\nto the side, his arms over his head, and lifted one foot and shook it around. 'I came\nhere because I woke in the night, and I walked out into the darkness, and the moon\nwhispered to me. In the forest, d'you see? In the trees, and in the voices of the owls\nin the trees, and d'you know what the moon said?'\n'That you're mad as fuck?' growled Dow.\nCrummock slapped his huge thigh. 'You've a pretty way of talking for an ugly\nman, Black Dow, but no. The moon said…' And he beckoned to the Dogman like he\nhad some secret to share. 'You got the Bloody-Nine down here.'\n'What if we do?' Logen came up quiet from behind, left hand resting on his\nsword. Tul and Grim came with him, frowning at all the painted-face hillmen stood\nabout, and at the three dirty children, and at their great fat father most of all.\n'There he is!' roared Crummock, sticking out one great sausage of a trembling\nfinger. 'Take your fist off that blade, Bloody-Nine, before I piss my breaks!' He\ndropped down on his knees in the dirt. 'This is him! This is the one!' He shuffled\nforward through the brush and he clung to Logen's leg, pressing himself up against it\nlike a dog to his master.\nLogen stared down at him. 'Get off my leg.'\n'That I will!' Crummock jerked away and dropped down on his fat arse in the\ndirt. Dogman had never seen such a performance. Looked like the rumours about\nhim being cracked were right enough. 'Do you know a fine thing, Bloody-Nine?'\n'More'n one, as it goes.'\n'Here's another, then. I saw you fight Shama Heartless.

He frowned. 'Though I could be\npersuaded to take my tongue to her. D'you follow me so far?'\n'I'm keeping up,' said Logen, but Dogman weren't altogether sure that he was.\n'Just whistle if you drop behind and I'll come right back for you. My meaning's\nthis. If Bethod were to get a good chance at catching you all alone, away from your\nUnion friends, your crawling-like-ants sunny-weather lovers over down there yonder,\nthen, well, he might give up a lot to take it.

Crummock turned\naway, spreading his great long arms out wide at Tul and Grim. 'But it's not just you,\nBloody-Nine! It's all of you, and me as well, and my three sons here!' The girl threw\nthe hammer down again and planted her hands on her hips, but Crummock blathered\non regardless. 'I'm thinking your boys join up with my boys and it might be we'll\nhave eight hundred spears. We'll head up north, like we're going up into the High\nPlaces, to get around behind Bethod and play merry mischief with his arse end. I'm\nthinking that'll get his blood up.

Worried to be fighting on the wrong side of the Whiteflow.\nMaybe they were hearing the Bloody-Nine was back, and thinking they'd picked the\nwrong side. Bethod would love to put a few heads on sticks for everyone to look at.\nNinefingers, and Crummock-i-Phail, Tul Duru and Black Dow, and maybe even the\nDogman too. He'd like that, would Bethod. Show the North there was no future in\nanything but him. He'd like it a lot.\n'Supposing we do wander off north,' asked Dogman. 'How's Bethod even going\nto know about it?'\nCrummock grinned wider than ever. 'Oh, he'll know because his witch'll know.'\n'Bloody witch,' piped up the lad with the spear, his thin arms trembling as he\nfought to keep it up straight.\n'That spell-cooking, painted-face bitch Bethod keeps with him. Or does she keep\nhim with her? There's a question, though. Either way, she's watching. Ain't she,\nBloody-Nine?'\n'I know who you mean,' said Logen, and not looking happy. 'Caurib. A friend o'\nmine once told me she had the long eye.' Dogman didn't have the first clue about all\nthat, but if Logen was taking it to heart he reckoned he'd better too.\n'The long eye, is it?' grinned Crummock. 'Your friend's got a pretty name for an\nugly trick. She sees all manner of goings-on with it. All kind of things it'd be better\nfor us if she didn't. Bethod trusts her eyes before he trusts his own, these days, and\nhe'll have her watching for us, and for you in particular. She'll have both her long\neyes open for it, that she will. I may be no wizard,' and he spun one of the wooden\nsigns around and around on his necklace, 'but the moon knows I'm no stranger to\nthe business neither.'\n'And what if it goes like you say?' rumbled Tul, 'what happens then? Apart from\nwe give Bethod our heads?'\n'Oh, I like my head where it is, big lad. We draw him on, north by north, that's\nwhat the forest told me. There's a place up in the mountains, a place well loved by\nthe moon. A strong valley, and watched over by the dead of my family, and the dead\nof my people, and the dead of the mountains, all the way back until when the world\nwas made.'\nDogman scratched his head. 'A fortress in the mountains?'\n'A strong, high place. High and strong enough for a few to hold off a many until\nhelp were to arrive. We lure him on up into the valley, and your Union friends follow\nup at a lazy distance. Far enough that his witch don't see 'em coming, she's so busy\nlooking at us. Then, while he's all caught up in trying to snuff us out for good and\nall, the Southerners creep up behind, and—' He slapped his palms together with an\nechoing crack.

'We squash him between us, the sheep-fucking bastard!'\n'Sheep-fucker!' cursed the girl, kicking at the hammer on the ground.\nThey all looked at each other for a moment. Dogman didn't much like the sound\nof this for a plan. He didn't much like the notion of trusting their lives to the say-so\no' this crazy hillman. But it sounded like some kind of a chance. Enough that he\ncouldn't just say no, however much he'd have liked to. 'We got to talk on this.'\n'Course you do, my new best friends, course you do. Don't take too long about\nit though, eh?' Crummock grinned wide. 'I been down from the High Places for way\ntoo long, and the rest o' my beautiful children, and my beautiful wives, and the\nbeautiful mountains themselves will all of them be missing me. Think on the sunny\nside o' this. If Bethod don't follow, you get a few nights sat up in the High Places as\nthe summer dies, warming yourselves at my fire, and listening to my songs, and\nwatching the sun going down over the mountains. That sound so bad? Does it?'\n'You thinking of listening to that mad bastard?' muttered Tul, once they'd got out\nof earshot. 'Witches and wizards and all that bloody rubbish? He makes it up as he\ngoes along!'\nLogen scratched his face. 'He's nowhere near as mad as he sounds. He's held out\nagainst Bethod all these years. The only one who has. Twelve winters is it now, he's\nbeen hiding, and raiding, and keeping one foot ahead? Up in the mountains maybe,\nbut still. He'd have to be slippery as fishes and tough as iron to make that work.'\n'You trust him, then?' asked Dogman.\n'Trust him?' Logen snorted. 'Shit, no. But his feud with Bethod's deeper even\nthan ours is. He's right about that witch, I seen her, and I seen some other things this\npast year… if he says she'll see us, I reckon I believe him. If she doesn't, and\nBethod don't come, well, nothing lost is there?'\nDogman had that empty feeling, worse'n ever. He looked over at Crummock,\nsitting on a rock with his children round him, and the madman smiled back a\nmouthful of yellow teeth. Hardly the man you'd want to hang all your hopes on, but\nDogman could feel the wind changing. 'We'd be taking one bastard of a risk,' he\nmuttered. 'What if Bethod caught up to us and got his way?'\n'We move fast, then, don't we!' growled Dow. 'It's a war. Taking risks is what\nyou do if you reckon on winning!'\n'Uh,' grunted Grim.\nTul nodded his big head. 'We've got to do something. I didn't come here to\nwatch Bethod sit on a hill. He needs to be got down.'\n'Got down where we can set to work on him!' hissed Dow.\n'But it's your choice.' Logen clapped his hand down on the Dogman's shoulder.\n'You're the chief.'"

Dogman had to admit, he'd much rather have told Crummock to fuck himself,\nthen turned round and headed back, and told West they never found a thing except\nwoods. But once you've got a task, you get it done. That's what Threetrees would've\nsaid.\nDogman gave a long sigh, that feeling in his gut bubbling up so high he was right\non the point of puking. 'Alright. But this plan ain't going to get us anything but dead\nunless the Union are ready to do their part, and in good time too.

'Long story.'\nFlowers and Plaudits\n« ^ »\nJezal still did not have the slightest idea why it was necessary for him to wear his\nbest uniform. The damn thing was stiff as a board and creaking with braid. It had\nbeen designed for standing to attention in rather than riding, and, as a result, dug\npainfully into his stomach with every movement of his horse. But Bayaz had insisted,\nand it was surprisingly difficult to say no to the old fool, whether Jezal was\nsupposed to be in command of this expedition or not. It had seemed easier, in the\nend, just to do as he was told. So he rode at the head of the long column in some\ndiscomfort, constantly tugging at his tunic and sweating profusely in the bright sun.\nThe one consolation was that he got to breathe fresh air. Everyone else had to eat his\ndust.\nTo further add to his pain, Bayaz was intent on continuing the themes that had\nmade Jezal so very bored all the way to the edge of the World and back.\n'… it is vital for a king to maintain the good opinion of his subjects. And it is not\nso very hard to do. The lowly have small ambitions, and are satisfied with small\nindulgences. They need not get fair treatment. They need only think that they do…'\nJezal found that after a while he could ignore the droning of the old man's voice,\nin the same way that one could ignore the barking of an old dog that barked all the\ntime. He slumped into his saddle and allowed his thoughts to wander. And where\nelse would they find their way, but to Ardee?\nHe had landed himself in quite a pickle, alright. Out on the plain, things had\nseemed so very simple. Get home, marry her, happily ever after. Now, back in Adua,\nback among the powerful, and back in his old habits, they grew more complicated\nby the day. The possibility of damage to his reputation and his prospects were\nissues that could not simply be dismissed. He was a Colonel in the King's Own, and\nthat meant certain standards to uphold.\n'… Harod the Great always had respect for the common man.

More than once, it\nwas the secret of his victories over his peers…'\nAnd then Ardee herself was so much more complicated in person than she had\nbeen as a silent memory. Nine parts witty, clever, fearless, attractive. One part a\nmean and destructive drunk. Every moment with her was a lottery, but perhaps it\nwas that sense of danger that struck the sparks when they touched, made his skin\ntingle and his mouth go dry… his skin was tingling now, even at the thought. He had\nnever felt like this about a woman before, not ever. Surely it was love. It had to be.\nBut was love enough? How long would it last? Marriage, after all, was forever, and\nforever was a very long time.\nAn indefinite extension of their current not-so secret romance would have been\nhis preferred choice, but that bastard Glokta had stuck his ruined foot through that\npossibility. Anvils, and sacks, and canals. Jezal remembered that white monster\nshoving his bag over a prisoner's head on a public thoroughfare, and shuddered at\nthe thought. But he had to admit that the cripple was right. Jezal's visits were not\ngood for that girl's reputation. One should treat others the way one would want to be\ntreated, he supposed, just as Ninefingers had once said. But it certainly was a\ndamned inconvenience.\n'… are you even listening, my boy?'\n'Eh? Er… yes, of course. Harod the Great, and so forth. The high respect he had\nfor the common man.'\n'Appeared to have,' grumbled Bayaz. 'And he knew how to take a lesson too.'\nThey were getting close to Adua now, passing out of the farmland and through\none of the huddles of shacks, impromptu dwellings, cheap inns and cheaper brothels\nthat had grown up around each of the city's gates, huddling about the road, each one\nalmost a town in its own right. Up into the long shadow of Casamir's Wall, the\noutermost of the city's lines of defence. A dour guardsmen stood on either side of\nthe high archway, gates marked with the Golden sun of the Union standing open.\nThey passed through the darkness and out into the light. Jezal blinked.\nA not inconsiderable number of people had gathered in the cobbled space\nbeyond, pressing in on either side of the road, held back by members of the city\nwatch. They burst into a chorus of happy cheers as they saw him ride through the\ngate. Jezal wondered for a moment if it was a case of mistaken identity, and they had\nbeen expecting someone of actual importance. Harod the Great, perhaps, for all he\nknew. He soon began to make out the name 'Luthar' repeated amongst the noise,\nhowever. A girl at the front flung a flower at him, lost under his horse's hooves, and\nshouted something he could not make out. But her manner left Jezal with no doubts.\nAll these people had gathered for him.\n'What's happening?' he whispered to the First of the Magi.\nBayaz grinned as though he, at least, had expected it.

'I imagine the people of\nAdua wish to celebrate your victory over the rebels.'\n'They do?' He winced and gave a limp-wristed wave, and the cheering grew\nnoticeably in volume. The crowd only thickened as they made their way into the city\nand the space reduced. There were people scattered up and down the narrow\nstreets, people at the downstairs windows and people higher up, whooping and\ncheering. More flowers were thrown from a balcony high above the road. One stuck\nin his saddle and Jezal picked it up, turned it round and round in his hand.\n'All this… for me?'\n'Did you not save the city? Did you not stop the rebels, and without spilling a\ndrop of blood on either side?'\n'But they gave up for no reason. I didn't do anything!'\nBayaz shrugged, snatched the flower from Jezal's hand and sniffed at it, then\ntossed it away and nodded his head towards a clump of cheering tradesmen\ncrowding a street corner. 'It would seem they disagree. Just keep your mouth shut\nand smile. That's always good advice.'\nJezal did his best to oblige, but the smiles were not coming easily. Logen\nNinefingers, he was reasonably sure, would not have approved. If there was an\nopposite to trying to look like less than you were, then this, surely, was its very\ndefinition. He glanced nervously around, convinced that the crowds would suddenly\nrecognise him for the utter fraud he felt, and replace the flowers and calls of\nadmiration with angry jeers and the contents of their chamber pots.\nBut it did not happen. The cheering continued as Jezal and his long column of\nsoldiers worked their slow way through the Three Farms district. With each street\nJezal passed down he relaxed a little more. He slowly began to feel as if he must\nindeed have achieved something worthy of the honour. To wonder if he might, in\nfact, have been a dauntless commander, a masterful negotiator. If the people of the\ncity wished to worship him as their hero, he began to suppose it would be churlish\nto refuse.\nThey passed through a gate in Arnault's Wall and into the central district of the\ncity. Jezal sat up tall in his saddle and puffed out his chest. Bayaz dropped behind to\na respectful distance, allowing him to lead the column alone. The cheering mounted\nas they tramped down the wide Middleway, as they crossed the Four Corners\ntowards the Agriont. It was like the feeling of victory at the Contest, only it had\ninvolved considerably less work, and was that really such an awful thing? What harm\ncould it do? Ninefingers and his humility be damned. Jezal had earned the attention.\nHe plastered a radiant smile across his face. He lifted his arm with self-satisfied\nconfidence, and began to wave.\nThe great walls of the Agriont rose up ahead and Jezal crossed the moat to the\nlooming south gatehouse, rode up the long tunnel into the fortress, the crackling\nhooves and tramping boots of the King's Own echoing in the darkness behind him."

At the far end a wide stand of benches\nhad been erected, a crimson canopy in the centre denoting the presence of royalty.\nThe noise and spectacle were breathtaking.\nJezal remembered the triumph laid on for Marshal Varuz when he returned from\nhis victory over the Gurkish, remembered staring wide-eyed, little more than a child.\nHe had caught one fleeting glimpse of the Marshal himself, seated high on a grey\ncharger, but never imagined that one day he might ride in the place of honour. It still\nseemed strange, if he was honest. After all, he had defeated a bunch of peasants\nrather than the most powerful nation in the Circle of the World. Still, it was hardly his\nplace to judge who was worthy of a triumph and who was not, was it?\nAnd so Jezal spurred his horse forwards, passing between the rows of smiling\nfaces, waving arms, through air thick with support and approval. He saw that the\ngreat men of the Closed Council were arranged across the front row of benches. He\nrecognised Arch Lector Sult in shining white, High Justice Marovia in solemn black.\nHis erstwhile fencing master, Lord Marshal Varuz, was there, Lord Chamberlain\nHoff just beside him. All applauding, mostly with a faint disdain which Jezal found\nrather ungracious. In the midst, well propped up on a gilded chair, was the King\nhimself.\nJezal, now fully adjusted to his role of conquering hero, dragged hard on the\nbridle making his steed rear up, front hooves thrashing theatrically at the air. He\nvaulted from the saddle, approached the royal dais, and sank gracefully down on\none knee, head bowed, the applause of the crowd echoing around him, to await the\nKing's gratitude. Would it be too much to hope for a further promotion? Perhaps\neven a title of his own? It seemed suddenly hard to believe that he had been forced\nto consider a quiet life in obscurity, not so very long ago.\n'Your Majesty…' he heard Hoff saying, and he peered up from under his brows.\nThe King was asleep, his eyes firmly closed, his mouth hanging open. Hardly a great\nsurprise in its own way, the man was long past his best, but Jezal could not help\nbeing galled. It was the second time, after all, that he had slumbered through one of\nJezal's moments of glory. Hoff nudged the monarch as subtly as possible with an\nelbow, but when he did not wake, was forced to lean close to whisper in his ear.\n'Your Majesty—' He got no further.

A silent moment passed, a moment in\nwhich every person in the Square of Marshals held their breath, then Hoff got slowly\nto his feet. His face had lost all of its redness.\n'The King is dead!' he wailed, the tortured echoes ringing from the towers and\nbuildings around the square. Jezal could only grimace. It was just his luck.

He knew all the ways, Crummock-i-Phail, all the ways in the North. That was the\nrumour, and Logen hoped it was a fact. He didn't fancy being led straight into an\nambush. They were heading north, towards the mountains. Hoping to draw Bethod\ndown off his hills and up into the High Places. Hoping the Union would come up\nbehind him, and catch him in a trap. An awful lot of hoping, that.\nIt was a hot, sunny day, and the earth under the trees was broken with shadow\nand slashed with bright sunlight, shifting as the branches moved in the wind, the sun\nslipping through and stabbing in Logen's face from time to time. Birds tweeted and\nwarbled, trees creaked and rustled, insects floated in the still air, and the forest floor\nwas spattered with clumps of flowers, white and blue. Summer, in the North, but\nnone of it made Logen feel any better. Summer was the best season for killing, and\nhe'd seen plenty more men die in good weather than in bad. So he kept his eyes\nopen, looking out into the trees, watching hard and listening harder.\nThat was the task Dogman had given him. Staying out on the right flank, making\nsure none of Bethod's boys crept up while they were all spread out in file down that\ngoat track. It suited Logen well enough. Kept him on the edge, where none of his\nown side might get tempted to try and kill him.\nWatching men moving quiet through the trees, voices kept down low, weapons at\nthe ready, brought back a rush of memories. Some good, some bad. Mostly bad, it\nhad to be said. One man came away from the others as Logen watched, started\nwalking towards him through the trees. He had a big grin on his face, just as friendly\nas you like, but that meant nothing, Logen had known plenty of men who could grin\nwhile they planned to kill you.

So\nhe shifted his feet for a better balance and stayed sitting, trying to look as if nothing\nworried him, but with every muscle tensed and ready to spring.\n'My name's Red Hat.' The man stopped no more than a stride away, still grinning,\nhis left hand slack on the pommel of his sword, the other just hanging.\nLogen's mind raced, thinking over all the men he'd wronged, or hurt, or got\nbound up in a feud with. Those he'd left alive, anyway. Red Hat. He couldn't find a\nplace for it anywhere, but that was no reassurance. Ten men with ten big books\ncouldn't have kept track of all the enemies he'd made, and the friends and the family\nand the allies of all his enemies. And that was without a man trying to kill him without\nmuch of a reason, just to make his own name bigger. 'Can't say I recognise the\nname.'\nRed Hat shrugged. 'No reason you should do. I fought for Old Man Yawl, way\nback. He was a good man, was Yawl, a man you could respect.'\n'Aye,' said Logen, still watching hard for a sudden move.\n'But when he went back to the mud I got a place with Littlebone.'\n'Never saw eye to eye with Littlebone, even when we were on the same side.'\n'Neither did I, being honest. A right bastard. All bloated up with victories that\nBethod won for him. Didn't sit well with me. That's why I came over, you know?\nWhen I heard Threetrees was here.' He sniffed and looked down at the earth.\n'Someone needs to do something about that fucking Feared.'\n'So they tell me.'

Or he'd let himself\npretend it would be different. Now he saw his mistake. He'd made a trap for himself,\nyears ago.

A great weight of death, like the shadow of a mountain\nfalling on him. Every time he said a word, or took a step, or had a thought, even, it\nseemed he'd somehow brought it closer. He drank it down with every swallow, he\nsucked it in with every breath. He hunched his shoulders up and stared down at his\nboots, strips of sunlight across the toes. He should never have let go of Ferro. He\nshould have clung to her like a child to its mother. How many things halfway good\nhad he been offered in his life? And now he'd turned one down, and chosen to come\nback and settle some scores. He licked his teeth, and he spat sour spit out onto the\nearth. He should've known better.

He pushed the blade away and let his\nhands drop. 'Do you know what? The thought had occurred.'\nThe Thunderhead squatted down beside him. 'Sometimes I find my own name's a\nheavy weight to carry. Dread to think how a name like yours must drag at a man.'\n'It can seem a burden.'\n'I bet it can.' Tul watched the men moving past, single file, down on the dusty\ntrack. 'Don't mind 'em. They'll get used to you. And if things get low, well, you've\nalways got Black Dow's smile to fall back on, eh?'\nLogen grinned. 'That's true. It's quite the smile he has, that man.

It seems to light\nup the whole world, don't it?'\n'Like sunshine on a cloudy day.' Tul sat down on the rock next to him, pulled the\nstopper from his canteen and held it out. 'I'm sorry.'\n'You're sorry? For what?'\n'That we didn't look for you, after you went over that cliff. Thought you were\ndead.'\n'Can't say I hold much of a grudge for that. I was pretty damn sure I was dead\nmyself. I'm the one should have gone looking for you lot, I reckon.'\n'Well. Should've looked for each other, maybe. But I guess you learn to stop\nhoping, after a while. Life teaches you to expect the worst, eh?'\n'You have to be realistic, I reckon.'\n'That you do. Still, it came out alright. Back with us now, aren't you?'\n'Aye.' Logen sighed. 'Back to warring, and bad food, and creeping through\nwoods.'\n'Woods,' grunted Tul, and he split a big grin. 'Will I ever get tired of em?\nLogen took a drink from the canteen, then handed it back, and Tul took a swig\nhimself. They sat there, silent, for a minute.\n'I didn't want this, you know, Tul.'\n'Course not. None of us wanted this. Don't mean we don't deserve it, though,\neh?' Tul slapped his big hand down on Logen's shoulder. 'You need to talk it over,\nI'm around.'\nLogen watched him go. He was a good man, the Thunderhead. A man that could\nbe trusted. There were still a few left. Tul, and Grim, and the Dogman. Black Dow\ntoo, in his own way. It almost gave Logen some hope, that did. Almost made him\nglad that he chose to come back to the North. Then he looked back at the file of\nmen and he saw Shivers in there, watching him. Logen would have liked to look\naway, but looking away wasn't something the Bloody-Nine could do. So he sat there\non his rock, and they stared at each other, and Logen felt the hatred digging at him\nuntil Shivers was lost through the trees. He shook his head again, and sucked his\nteeth again, and spat.\nYou can never have too many knives, his father had told him. Unless they're\npointed at you, and by people who don't like you much.\nBest of Enemies\n« ^ »\nTap, tap.\n'Not now!' stormed Colonel Glokta. 'I have all these to get through!' There must\nhave been ten thousand papers of confession for him to sign. His desk was groaning\nwith great heaps of them, and the nib of his pen was soft as butter. What with the\nred ink, his marks looked like dark bloodstains sprayed across the pale paper.\n'Damn it!' he raged as he knocked over the bottle with his elbow, splashing ink out\nover the desk, soaking into the piles of papers, dripping to the floor with a steady\ntap, tap, tap.\n'There will be time later for you to confess. Ample time.'"

The air had grown decidedly chill. 'You again! Always at\nthe worst times!'\n'You remember me, then?'\n'I seem to…' In truth, the Colonel was finding it hard to recall from where. It\nlooked like a woman in the corner, but he could not make out her face.\n'The Maker fell burning… he broke upon the bridge below…' The words were\nfamiliar, but Glokta could not have said why. Old stories and nonsense. He winced.\nDamn it but his leg hurt.\n'I seem to…' His usual confidence was all ebbing away. The room was icy cold\nnow, he could see his breath smoking before his face. He stumbled up from his chair\nas his unwelcome visitor came closer, his leg aching with a vengeance. 'What do you\nwant?' he managed to croak.\nThe face came into the light. It was none other than Mauthis, from the banking\nhouse of Valint and Balk. 'The Seed, Colonel.' And he smiled his joyless smile. 'I\nwant the Seed.'\n'I… I…' Glokta's back found the wall. He could go no further.\n'The Seed!' Now it was Goyle's face, now Sult's, now Severard's, but they all\nmade the same demand. 'The Seed! I lose patience!'\n'Bayaz,' he whispered, squeezing his eyes closed, tears running out from\nunderneath his lids. 'Bayaz knows—'\n'Tap, tap, torturer.' The woman's hissing voice again. A finger-tip jabbed at the\nside of his head, painfully hard. 'If that old liar knew, it would be mine already. No.\nYou will find it.' He could not speak for fear. 'You will find it, or I will tear the price\nfrom your twisted flesh. So tap, tap, time to wake.'\nThe finger stabbed at his skull again, digging into the side of his head like a\ndagger blade. 'Tap, tap, cripple!' hissed the hideous voice in his ear, breath so cold\nit seemed to burn his bare cheek. 'Tap, tap!'\nTap, tap.\nFor a moment Glokta hardly knew where he was. He jerked upright, struggling\nwith the sheets, staring about him, hemmed in on every side by threatening shadows,\nhis own whimpering breath hissing in his head. Then everything fell suddenly into\nplace. My new apartments. A pleasant breeze stirred the curtains in the sticky night,\nwashing through the one open window. Glokta saw its shadow shifting on the\nrendered wall. It swung shut against the frame, open, then shut again.\nTap, tap.\nHe closed his eyes and breathed a long sigh. Winced as he sagged back in his\nbed, stretching his legs out, working his toes against the cramps. Those toes the\nGurkish left me, at least. Only another dream.

        "text": "Then he remembered, and his eyes snapped wide open. The King is dead.\nTomorrow we elect a new one.\nThe three hundred and twenty papers were hanged, lifeless, from their nails. They\nhad grown more and more creased, battered, greasy and grubby over the past few\nweeks. As the business itself has slid further into the filth. Many were ink smudged,\ncovered with angrily scrawled notes, with fillings-in and crossings-out. As men were\nbought and sold, bullied and blackmailed, bribed and beguiled. Many were torn\nwhere wax had been removed, added, replaced with other colours. As the\nallegiances shifted, as the promises were broken, as the balance swung this way\nand that.\nArch Lector Sult stood glaring at them, like a shepherd at his troublesome flock,\nhis white coat rumpled, his white hair in disarray. Glokta had never before seen him\nlook anything less than perfectly presented. He must, at last, taste blood. His own. I\nwould almost want to laugh, if my own mouth were not so terribly salty.\n'Brock has seventy-five,' Sult was hissing to himself, white gloved hands fussing\nwith each other behind his back. 'Brock has seventy-five. Isher has fifty-five. Skald\nand Barezin, forty a piece. Brock has seventy-five…' He muttered the numbers over\nand over, as though they were a charm to protect him from evil. Or from good,\nperhaps. 'Isher has fifty-five…'\nGlokta had to suppress a smile. Brock, then Isher, then Skald and Barezin,\nwhile the Inquisition and Judiciary struggle over scraps. For all our efforts, the\nshape of things is much the same as when we began this ugly dance. We might as\nwell have led the country then and saved ourselves the trouble. Perhaps it is still\nnot too late…\nGlokta noisily cleared his throat and Sult's head jerked round. 'You have\nsomething to contribute?'\n'In a manner of speaking, your Eminence.' Glokta kept his tone as servile as he\npossibly could. 'I received some rather… troubling information recently.'\nSult scowled, and nodded his head at the papers. 'More troubling than this?'\nEqually, at any rate. After all, whoever wins the vote will have but a brief\ncelebration if the Gurkish arrive and slaughter the lot of us a week later. 'It has\nbeen suggested to me… that the Gurkish are preparing to invade Midderland.'\nThere was a brief, uncomfortable pause. Scarcely a promising reception, but we\nhave set sail now. What else to do but steer straight for the storm? 'Invade?'\nsneered Goyle. 'With what?'\n'It is not the first time I have been told they have a fleet.' Trying desperately to\npatch my foundering vessel. 'A considerable fleet, built in secret, after the last war.\nWe could easily make some preparations, then if the Gurkish do come—'\n'And what if you are wrong?' The Arch Lector was frowning mightily. 'From\nwhom did this information come?'\nOh, dear me no, that would never do. Carlot dan Eider? Alive? But how?\nBody found floating by the docks… 'An anonymous source, Arch Lector.'"

But how?\nBody found floating by the docks… 'An anonymous source, Arch Lector.'\n'Anonymous?' His Eminence glowered through narrowed eyes. 'And you would\nhave me go to the Closed Council, at a time like this, and put before them the\nunproven gossip of your anonymous source?' The waves swamp the deck…\n'I merely wished to alert your Eminence to the possibility—'\n'When are they coming?' The torn sailcloth flaps in the gale…\n'My informant did not—'\n'Where will they land?' The sailors topple screaming from the rigging…\n'Again, your Eminence I cannot—'\n'What will be their numbers?' The wheel breaks off in my shaking hands…\nGlokta winced, and decided not to speak at all.\n'Then kindly refrain from distracting us with rumours,' sneered Sult, his lip\ntwisted with contempt. The ship vanishes beneath the merciless waves, her cargo\nof precious warnings consigned to the deep, and her captain will not be missed.\n'We have more pressing concerns than a legion of Gurkish phantoms!'\n'Of course, your Eminence.' And if the Gurkish come, who will we hang? Oh,\nSuperior Glokta, of course. Why ever did that damn cripple not speak up?\nSult's mind had already slipped back into its well-worn circles. 'We have\nthirty-one votes and Marovia has something over twenty. Thirty-one. Not enough to\nmake the difference.' He shook his head grimly, blue eyes darting over the papers. As\nif there were some new way to look at them that would alter the terrible\nmathematics. 'Nowhere near enough.'\n'Unless we were to come to an understanding with High Justice Marovia.' Again,\na pause, even more uncomfortable than last time. Oh dear. I must have said that out\nloud.\n'An understanding?' hissed Sult.\n'With Marovia?' squealed Goyle, his eyes bulging with triumph. When the safe\noptions are all exhausted, we must take risks. Is that not what I told myself as I\nrode down to the bridge, while the Gurkish massed upon the other side? Ah well,\nonce more into the tempest…\nGlokta took a deep breath. 'Marovia's seat on the Closed Council is no safer than\nanyone else's. We may have been working against each other, but only out of habit.\nOn the subject of this vote our aims are the same. To secure a weak candidate and\nmaintain the balance. Together you have more than fifty votes. That might well be\nenough to tip the scales.'\nGoyle sneered his contempt. 'Join forces with that peasant-loving hypocrite?\nHave you lost your reason?'\n'Shut up, Goyle.' Sult glared at Glokta for a long while, his lips pursed in thought.\nConsidering my punishment, perhaps? Another tongue-lashing? Or a real\nlashing? Or my body found floating— 'You are right. Go and speak to Marovia.'\nSand dan Glokta, once more the hero! Goyle's jaw hung open. 'But… your\nEminence!'"

'We must seize any chance of\nkeeping Brock and the rest from the throne. We must find compromises, however\npainful, and we must take whatever allies we can. Go!' he hissed over his shoulder,\nfolding his arms and turning back to his crackling papers. 'Strike a deal with\nMarovia.'\nGlokta got stiffly up from his chair. A shame to leave such lovely company, but\nwhen duty calls… He treated Goyle to the briefest of toothless smiles, then took up\nhis cane and limped for the door.\n'And Glokta!' He winced as he turned back into the room. 'Marovia's aims and\nours may meet for now. But we cannot trust him. Tread carefully.'\n'Of course, your Eminence.' I always do. What other choice, when every step is\nagony?\nThe private office of the High Justice was as big as a barn, its ceiling covered in\nfestoons of old moulding, riddled with shadows. Although it was only late afternoon,\nthe thick ivy outside the windows, and the thick grime on the panes, had sunk the\nplace into a perpetual twilight. Tottering heaps of papers were stacked on every\nsurface. Wedges of documents tied with black tape. Piles of leather-bound ledgers.\nStacks of dusty parchments in ostentatious, swirling script, stamped with huge seals\nof red wax and glittering gilt. A kingdom's worth of law, it looked like. And, indeed,\nit probably is.\n'Superior Glokta, good evening.' Marovia himself was seated at a long table near\nthe empty fireplace, set for dinner, a flickering candelabra making each dish glisten in\nthe gloom. 'I hope you do not mind if I eat while we talk? I would rather dine in the\ncomfort of my rooms, but I find myself eating here more and more. So much to do,\nyou see? And one of my secretaries appears to have taken a holiday unannounced.'\nA holiday to the slaughterhouse floor, in fact, by way of the intestines of a herd of\nswine. 'Would you care to join me?' Marovia gestured at a large joint of meat, close\nto raw in the centre, swimming in bloody gravy.\nGlokta licked at his empty gums as he manoeuvred himself into a chair opposite.\n'I would be delighted, your Worship, but the laws of dentistry prevent me.'\n'Ah, of course. Those laws there can be no circumventing, even by a High\nJustice. You have my sympathy, Superior. One of my greatest pleasures is a good\ncut of meat, and the bloodier the better. Just show them the flame, I always tell my\ncook. Just show it to them.' Funny. I tell my Practicals to start the same way. 'And\nto what do I owe this unexpected visit? Do you come on your own initiative, or at\nthe urging of your employer, my esteemed colleague from the Closed Council, Arch\nLector Sult?'\nYour bitter mortal enemy from the Closed Council, do you mean? 'His Eminence\nis aware that I am here.'"

'His Eminence\nis aware that I am here.'\n'Is he?' Marovia carved another slice and lifted it dripping onto his plate. 'And\nwith what message has he sent you? Something relating to tomorrow's business in\nthe Open Council, perhaps?'\n'You spoil my surprise, your Worship. May I speak plainly?'\n'If you know how.'\nGlokta showed the High Justice his empty grin. 'This affair with the vote is a\nterrible thing for business. The doubt, the uncertainty, the worry. Bad for everyone's\nbusiness.'\n'Some more than others.' Marovia's knife squealed against the plate as he slit a\nribbon of fat from the edge of his meat.\n'Of course. At particular risk are those that sit on the Closed Council, and those\nthat struggle on their behalf. They are unlikely to be given such a free hand if\npowerful men such as Brock or Isher are voted to the throne.' Some of us, indeed,\nare unlikely to live out the week.\nMarovia speared a slice of carrot with his fork and stared sourly at it. 'A\nlamentable state of affairs. It would have been preferable for all concerned if\nRaynault or Ladisla were still alive.' He thought about it for a moment. 'If Raynault\nwere still alive, at least. But the vote will take place tomorrow, however much we\nmight tear our hair. It is hard now to see our way to a remedy.' He looked from the\ncarrot to Glokta. 'Or do you suggest one?'\n'You, your Worship, control between twenty and thirty votes on the Open\nCouncil.'\nMarovia shrugged. 'I have some influence, I cannot deny it.'\n'The Arch Lector can call on thirty votes himself.'\n'Good for his Eminence.'\n'Not necessarily. If the two of you oppose each other, as you always have, your\nvotes will mean nothing. One for Isher, the other for Brock, and no difference made.'\nMarovia sighed. 'A sad end to our two glittering careers.'\n'Unless you were to pool your resources. Then you might have sixty votes\nbetween you. As many, almost, as Brock controls. Enough to make a King of Skald,\nor Barezin, or Heugen, or even some unknown, depending on how things go.\nSomeone who might be more easily influenced in the future. Someone who might\nkeep the Closed Council he has, rather than selecting a new one.'\n'A King to make us all happy, eh?'\n'If you were to express a preference for one man or another, I could take that\nback to his Eminence.' More steps, more coaxing, more disappointments. Oh, to\nhave a great office of my own, and to sit all day in comfort while cringing\nbastards slog up my stairs to smile at my insults, lap up my lies, beg for my\npoisonous support.\n'Shall I tell you what would make me happy, Superior Glokta?'\nNow for the musings of another power-mad old fart.

'I would like no King at all. I would like every man equal under the law, to\nhave a say in the running of his own country and the choosing of his own leaders. I\nwould like no King, and no nobles, and a Closed Council selected by, and\nanswerable to, the citizens themselves. A Closed Council open to all, you might say.\nWhat do you think of that?'\nI think some people would say that it sounds very much like treason. The rest\nwould simply call it madness. 'I think, your Worship, that your notion is a fantasy.'\n'Why so?'\n'Because the vast majority of men would far rather be told what to do than make\ntheir own choices. Obedience is easy.'\nThe High Justice laughed. 'Perhaps you are right. But things will change. This\nrebellion has convinced me of it. Things will change, by small steps.'\n'I am sure Lord Brock on the throne is one small step none of us would like to\nsee taken.'\n'Lord Brock does indeed have very strong opinions, mostly relating to himself.\nYou make a convincing case, Superior.' Marovia sat back in his chair, hands resting\non his belly, staring at Glokta through narrowed eyes. 'Very well. You may tell Arch\nLector Sult that this once we have common cause. If a neutral candidate with\nsufficient support presents themselves, I will have my votes cast along with his. Who\ncould have thought it? The Closed Council united.' He slowly shook his head.\n'Strange times indeed.'\n'They certainly are, your Worship.' Glokta struggled to his feet, wincing as he put\nhis weight on his burning leg, and shuffled across the gloomy, echoing space\ntowards the door. Strange, though, that our High Justice is so philosophical on the\nsubject of losing his position tomorrow. I have scarcely ever seen a man look\ncalmer. He paused as he touched the handle of the door. One would almost\nsuppose that he knows something we do not. One might almost suppose that he\nalready has a plan in mind.\nHe turned back. 'Can I trust you, High Justice?'\nMarovia looked sharply up, the carving knife poised in his hand. 'What a\nbeautifully quaint question from a man in your line of work. I suppose that you can\ntrust me to act in my own interests. Just as far as I can trust you to do the same. Our\ndeal goes no further than that. Nor should it. You are a clever man, Superior, you\nmake me smile.' And he turned back to his joint of meat, prodding at it with a fork\nand making the blood run. 'You should find another master.'\nGlokta shuffled out. A charming suggestion. But I already have two more than\nI'd like.\nThe prisoner was a scrawny, sinewy specimen, naked and bagged as usual, with\nhands manacled securely behind his back.

Who has me? What do\nthey want? A horrifying moment, just before the work begins. The terror and the\nhelplessness, the sick tingling of anticipation. My own memory of it was sharply\nrefreshed, only the other day, at the hands of the charming Magister Eider. I was\nset free unmolested, however. The prisoner sat there, head tilted to one side, the\ncanvas on the front of the bag moving back and forth with his hurried breath. I very\nmuch doubt that he will be so lucky.\nGlokta's eyes crept reluctantly to the painting above the prisoner's bagged head.\nOur old friend Kanedias. The painted face stared grimly down from the domed\nceiling, the arms spread wide, the colourful fire behind. The Maker fell burning…\nHe weighed the heavy hammer reluctantly in his hand. 'Let's get on with it, then.'\nSeverard snatched the canvas bag away with a showy flourish.\nThe Navigator squinted into the bright lamplight, a weather-beaten face, tanned\nand deeply lined, head shaved, like a priest. Or a confessed traitor, of course.\n'Your name is Brother Longfoot?'\n'Indeed! Of the noble Order of Navigators! I assure you that I am innocent of any\ncrime!' The words came out in rush. 'I have done nothing unlawful, no. That would\nnot be my way at all. I am a law-abiding man, and always have been. I can think of\nno possible reason why I should be manhandled in this way! None!' His eyes\nswivelled down and he saw the anvil, gleaming on the floor between him and Glokta,\nwhere the table would usually have been. His voice rose an entire octave higher. 'The\nOrder of Navigators is well respected, and I am a member in good standing!\nExceptional standing! Navigation is the foremost of my many remarkable talents, it is\nindeed, the foremost of—'\nGlokta cracked his hammer against the top of the anvil with a clang to wake the\ndead. 'Stop! Talking!' The little man blinked, and gaped, but he shut up. Glokta sank\nback in his chair, kneading at his withered thigh, the pain prickling up his back. 'Do\nyou have any notion of how tired I am? Of how much I have to do? The agony of\ngetting out of bed each morning leaves me a broken man before the day even begins,\nand the present moment is an exceptionally stressful one. It is therefore a matter of\nthe most supreme indifference to me whether you can walk for the rest of your life,\nwhether you can see for the rest of your life, whether you can hold your shit in for\nthe rest of your intensely short, intensely painful life. Do you understand?'\nThe Navigator looked wide-eyed up at Frost, looming over him like an outsize\nshadow. 'I understand,' he whispered.\n'Good,' said Severard.\n'Ve' gooth,' said Frost."

I do not speak other than to—'\nFrost's fist sunk into his gut and he folded up, eyes bulging. 'Do you see,' hissed\nGlokta, 'that your answer there should have been yes?' The albino seized the\nwheezing Navigator's leg and dragged his foot up onto the anvil. Oh, cold metal on\nthe sensitive sole. Quite unpleasant, but it could be so much worse. And something\ntells me it probably will be. Frost snapped a manacle shut around Longfoot's ankle.\n'I apologise for the lack of imagination.' Glokta sighed. 'In our defence, it's\ndifficult to be always thinking of something new. I mean, smashing a man's feet with\na lump hammer, it's so…'\n'Pethethrian?' ventured Frost.\nGlokta heard a sharp volley of laughter from behind Severard's mask, felt his own\nmouth grinning too. He really should have been a comedian, rather than a torturer\n. 'Pedestrian! Precisely so. But don't worry. If we haven't got what we need by the\ntime we've crushed everything below your knees to pulp, we'll see if we can think of\nsomething more inventive for the rest of your legs. How does that sound?'\n'But I have done nothing!' squealed Longfoot, just getting his breath back. 'I\nknow nothing! I did—'\n'Forget… about all that. It is meaningless now.' Glokta leaned slowly, painfully\nforwards, let the head of the hammer tap gently against the iron beside the\nNavigator's bare foot. 'What I want you to concentrate on… are my questions… and\nyour toes… and this hammer. But don't worry if you find that difficult now. Believe\nme when I say—once the hammer starts falling, you will find it easy to ignore\neverything else.'\nLongfoot stared at the anvil, nostrils flaring as his breath snorted quickly in and\nout. And the seriousness of the situation finally impresses itself upon him.\n'Questions, then,' said Glokta. 'You are familiar with the man who styles himself\nBayaz, the First of the Magi?'\n'Yes! Please! Yes! Until recently he was my employer.'\n'Good.' Glokta shifted in his chair, trying to find a more comfortable position\nwhile bending forwards. 'Very good. You accompanied him on a journey?'\n'I was the guide!'\n'What was your destination?'\n'The Island of Shabulyan, at the edge of the World.'\nGlokta let the head of the hammer click against the anvil again. 'Oh come, come.\nThe edge of the World? A fantasy, surely?'\n'Truly! Truly! I have seen it! I stood upon that island with my own feet!'"

About the Other Side.'\n'What else?' Glokta dealt Longfoot's toe a firmer tap with the hammer.\n'Ah! Ah! He said the Seed was the stuff of the world below! That it was left over\nfrom before the Old Time, when demons walked the earth! He said it was a great and\npowerful weapon! That he meant to use it, against the Gurkish! Against the Prophet!'\nA weapon, from before the Old Time. The summoning of devils, the taking of\nforms. Kanedias seemed to frown down from the wall more grimly than ever, and\nGlokta flinched. He remembered his nightmare trip into the House of the Maker, the\npatterns of light on the floor, the shifting rings in the darkness. He remembered\nstepping out onto the roof, standing high above the city without climbing a single\nstair.\n'You did not find it?' he whispered, his mouth dry.\n'No! It was not there!'\n'And then?'\n'That was all! We came back across the mountains. We made a raft and rode the\ngreat Aos back to the sea. We took a ship from Calcis and I sit before you now!'\nGlokta narrowed his eyes, studying carefully his prisoner's face. There is more. I\nsee it. 'What are you not telling me?'\n'I have told you everything! I have no talent for dissembling!' That, at least, is\ntrue. His lies are plain."

The heavy hammer came down with all of Glokta's crippled\nstrength and crushed Longfoot's big toe flat with a dull thud. The Navigator gaped at\nit, eyes bulging from his head. Ah, that beautiful, horrible moment between\nstubbing your toe and feeling the hurt. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it—\nLongfoot let vent a great shriek, squirmed around in his chair, face contorted with\nagony.\n'I know the feeling,' said Glokta, wincing as he wriggled his own remaining toes\naround in his sweaty boot. 'I truly, truly do, and I sympathise. That blinding flash of\npain, then up washes the sick and dizzy faintness of the shattered bone, then the\nslow pulsing up the leg that seems to drag the water from your eyes and make your\nwhole body tremble.' Longfoot gasped, and whimpered, tears glistening on his\ncheeks. 'And what comes next? Weeks of limping? Months of hobbling, crippled?\nAnd if the next blow is to on your ankle?' Glokta prodded at Longfoot's shin with\nthe end of the hammer. 'Or square on your kneecap, what then? Will you ever walk\nagain? I know the feelings well, believe me.' So how can I inflict them now, on\nsomeone else? He shrugged his twisted shoulders. One of life's mysteries. 'Another?'\nAnd he raised the hammer again.\n'No! No! Wait!' wailed Longfoot. 'The priest! God help me, a priest came to the\nOrder! A Gurkish priest! He said that one day the First of the Magi might ask for a\nNavigator, and that he wished to be told of it! That he wished to be told what\nhappened afterward! He made threats, terrible threats, we had no choice but to obey!\nI was waiting in the city for another Navigator, who will convey the news! Only this\nmorning I told him everything I have told you! I was about to leave Adua, I swear!'\n'What was the name of this priest?' Longfoot said nothing, his wet eyes wide, the\nbreath hissing in his nose. Oh, why must they test me? Glokta looked down at the\nNavigator's toe. It was already starting to swell and go blotchy, streaks of black\nblood-blisters down each side, the nail deep, brooding purple, edged with angry red.\nGlokta ground the end of the hammer's handle savagely into it. 'The name of the\npriest! His name! His name! His—'\n'Aargh! Mamun! God help me! His name was Mamun!' Mamun. Yulwei spoke of\nhim, in Dagoska. The first apprentice of the Prophet himself.

Longfoot\nsqueezed his eyes shut, tongue wedged between his teeth. Here it comes. Here it\ncomes.

'I am satisfied.'\nThe prisoner opened first one grimacing eye, and then the other. He looked up,\nface full of hope. 'I can go?'\nSeverard chuckled softly behind his mask.

The preparations are well underway. We should be\nready to leave at first light.'\n'As efficient as ever. Where would I be without you?' Burr gestured at the\ndecanter. 'Wine?'\n'Thank you, sir.' West poured himself a glass. 'Would you care for one?'\nBurr indicated a battered canteen at his elbow. 'I believe it would be prudent if I\nwas to stick to water.'\nWest winced, guiltily. He hardly felt as if he had the right to ask, but there was no\nescaping it now. 'How are you feeling, sir?'\n'Much better, thank you for asking. Much, much better.' He grimaced, put one\nfist over his mouth, and burped. 'Not entirely recovered, but well on the way.' As\nthough to prove the point he got up easily from his chair and strode to the map,\nhands clasped behind his back. His face had indeed regained much of its colour. He\nno longer stood hunched over, wobbling as though he were about to fall.\n'Lord Marshal… I wanted to speak to you… about the battle at Dunbrec'\nBurr looked round. 'About what feature of it?'\n'When you were sick…' West teetered on the brink of speaking, then let the\nwords bubble out. 'I didn't send for a surgeon!

'You did what I would have wanted you to do. It is important that an officer\nshould care, but it is vital that he should not care too much. He must be able to place\nhis men in harm's way. He must be able to send them to their deaths, if he deems it\nnecessary. He must be able to make sacrifices, and to weigh the greatest good,\nwithout emotion counting in his choice. That is why I like you, West. You have\ncompassion in you, but you have iron too. One cannot be a great leader without a\ncertain… ruthlessness.'\nWest found himself lost for words. The Lord Marshal chuckled, and slapped the\ntable with his open hand. 'But as it happens, no harm done, eh? The line held, the\nNorthmen were turned out of Angland, and I tottered through alive, as you can see!'\n'I am truly glad to see you feeling better, sir.'\nBurr grinned. 'Things are looking up. We are free to move again, with our lines of\nsupply secure and the weather finally dry. If your Dogman's plan works then we\nhave a chance of finishing Bethod within a couple of weeks! They've been a damn\ncourageous and useful set of allies!'\n'They have, sir.'\n'But this trap must be carefully baited, and sprung at just the right moment.' Burr\npeered at the map, rocking energetically back and forward on his heels. 'If we're too\nearly Bethod may slip away. If we're too late our Northern friends could be crushed\nbefore we can reach them. We have to make sure bloody Poulder and bloody Kroy\ndon't drag their bloody feet!' He winced and put a hand on his stomach, reached for\nhis canteen and took a swig of water.\n'I'd say you finally have them house-trained, Lord Marshal.'\n'Don't you believe it. They're only waiting for their chance to put the knife in me,\nthe pair of them! And now the King is dead. Who knows who will replace him?\nVoting for a monarch! Have you ever heard of such a thing?'\nWest's mouth felt unpleasantly dry. It was almost impossible to believe that the\nwhole business had been partly his own doing. It would hardly have done to take\ncredit for it however, given that his part had been to murder the heir to the throne in\ncold blood. 'Who do you think they will choose, sir?' he croaked.\n'I'm no courtier, West, for all I have a seat on the Closed Council. Brock, maybe,\nor Isher? I'll tell you one thing for sure—if you think there's violence going on up\nhere, it'll be twice as brutal back home in Midderland, with half the mercy shown.'\nThe Marshal burped, and swallowed, and laid a hand on his stomach. 'Gah. No\nNorthman's anything like as ruthless as those vultures on the Closed Council when\nthey get started. And what will change when they have their new man in his robes of\nstate? Not much, I'm thinking. Not much.'\n'Very likely, sir.'"

He stepped up close to the map again, and traced their route\nnorthwards towards the mountains, his thick forefinger hissing over the paper. 'We\nmust make sure we are ready to move at sunup. Every hour could be vital. Poulder\nand Kroy have had their orders?'\n'Signed and delivered, sir, and they understand the urgency. Don't worry, Lord\nMarshal, we'll be ready to go in the morning.'\n'Don't worry?' Burr snorted. 'I'm the commander of his Majesty's army.\nWorrying is what I do. But you should get some rest.' He waved West out of the\ntent with one thick hand. 'I'll see you at first light.'\nThey played their cards by torchlight on the hillside, in the calm night under the stars,\nand by torchlight below them the Union army made its hurried preparations to\nadvance. Lamps bobbed and moved, soldiers cursed in the darkness. Bangs, and\nclatters, and the ill-tempered calls of men and beasts floated through the still air.\n'There'll be no sleep for anyone tonight.' Brint finished dealing and scraped up his\ncards with his fingernails.\n'I wish I could remember the last time I got more than three good hours together,'\nsaid West. Back in Adua, most likely, before his sister came to the city. Before the\nMarshal put him on his staff. Before he came back to Angland, before he met Prince\nLadisla, before the freezing journey north and the things he had done on it. He\nhunched his shoulders and frowned down at his dog-eared cards.\n'How's the Lord Marshal?' asked Jalenhorm.\n'Much better, I'm pleased to say.'\n'Thank the fates for that.' Kaspa raised his brows. 'I don't much fancy the idea of\nthat pedant Kroy in charge.'\n'Or Poulder either,' said Brint. 'The man's ruthless as a snake.'\nWest could only agree. Poulder and Kroy hated him almost as much as they\nhated each other. If one of them took command he'd be lucky if he found himself\nswabbing latrines the following day. Probably he'd be on a boat to Adua within the\nweek. To swab latrines there.\n'Have you heard about Luthar?' asked Jalenhorm.\n'What about him?'\n'He's back in Adua.' West looked up sharply. Ardee was in Adua, and the idea of\nthe two of them together again was not exactly a heartening thought.\n'I had a letter from my cousin Ariss.' Kaspa squinted as he clumsily fanned out\nhis cards. 'She says Jezal was far away somewhere, on some kind of mission for the\nking.'\n'A mission?' West doubted anyone would have trusted Jezal with anything\nimportant enough to be called a mission.\n'All of Adua is buzzing with it, apparently.'\n'They say he led some charge or other,' said Jalenhorm, 'across some bridge.'"

'Did he now?'\n'They say he killed a score of men on the battlefield.'\n'Only a score?'\n'They say he bedded the Emperor's daughter,' murmured Brint.\nWest snorted. 'Somehow I find that the most believable of the three.'\nKaspa spluttered with laughter. 'Well whatever the truth of it, he's been made up\nto Colonel.'\n'Good for him,' muttered West, 'he always seems to fall on his feet, that boy.'\n'Did you hear about this revolt?'\n'My sister mentioned something about it in her last letter. Why?'\n'There was a full-scale rebellion, Ariss tells me. Thousands of peasants, roaming\nthe countryside, burning and looting, hanging anyone with a 'dan' in their name.\nGuess who was given command of the force sent to stop them?'\nWest sighed. 'Not our old friend Jezal dan Luthar, by any chance?'\n'The very same, and he persuaded them to go back to their homes, how about\nthat?'\n'Jezal dan Luthar,' murmured Brint, 'with the common touch. Who could have\nthought it?'\n'Not me.' Jalenhorm emptied his glass and poured himself another. 'But they're\ncalling him a hero now, apparently.'\n'Toasting him in the taverns,' said Brint.\n'Congratulating him in the Open Council,' said Kaspa.\nWest scraped the jingling pile of coins towards him with the edge of his hand. 'I\nwish I could say I was surprised, but I always guessed I'd be taking my orders from\nLord Marshal Luthar one of these days.' It could have been worse, he supposed. It\ncould have been Poulder or Kroy.\nThe first pink glow of dawn was creeping across the tops of the hills as West\nwalked up the slope towards the Lord Marshal's tent. It was past time to give the\nword to move. He saluted grimly to the guards beside the flap and pushed on\nthrough. One lamp was still burning in the corner beyond, casting a ruddy glow over\nthe maps, over the folding chairs and the folding tables, filling the creases in the\nblankets on Burr's bed with black shadows. West crossed to it, thinking over all the\ntasks he had to get done that morning, checking that he had left nothing out.\n'Lord Marshal, Poulder and Kroy are waiting for your word to move.' Burr lay\nupon his camp bed, his eyes closed, his mouth open, sleeping peacefully. West\nwould have liked to leave him there, but time was already wasting. 'Lord Marshal!' he\nsnapped, walking up close to the bed. Still he did not respond.\nThat was when West noticed that his chest was not moving.\nHe reached out with hesitant fingers and held them above Burr's open mouth. No\nwarmth. No breath. West felt the horror slowly spreading out from his chest to the\nvery tips of his fingers. There could be no doubt. Lord Marshal Burr was dead.\nIt was grey morning when the coffin was carried from the tent on the shoulders of\nsix solemn guardsmen, the surgeon walking along behind with his hat in his hand."

Burr himself would no doubt have approved of the simple box in\nwhich his corpse would be shipped back to Adua. The same rough carpentry in\nwhich the Union's lowest levies were buried.\nWest stared at it, numb.\nThe man inside had been like a father to him, or the closest he had ever come to\nhaving one. A mentor and protector, a patron and a teacher. An actual father, rather\nthan the bullying, drunken worm that nature had cursed him with. And yet he did not\nfeel sorrow as he stared at that rough wooden box. He felt fear. For the army and for\nhimself. His first instinct was not to weep, it was to run. But there was nowhere to\nrun to. Every man had to do his part, now more than ever.\nKroy lifted his sharp chin and stood up iron rigid as the shadow of the casket\npassed across them. 'Marshal Burr will be much missed. He was a staunch soldier,\nand a brave leader.'\n'A patriot,' chimed in Poulder, his lip trembling, one hand pressed against his\nchest as though it might burst open with emotion. 'A patriot who gave his life for his\ncountry! It was my honour to serve under his orders.'\nWest wanted to vomit at their hypocrisy, but the fact was he desperately needed\nthem. The Dogman and his people were out in the hills, moving north, trying to lure\nBethod into a trap. If the Union army did not follow, and soon, they would have no\nhelp when the King of the Northmen finally caught up to them. They would only\nsucceed in luring themselves into their graves.\n'A terrible loss,' said West, watching the coffin carried slowly down the hillside,\n'but we will honour him best by fighting on.'\nKroy gave a regulation nod. 'Well said, Colonel. We will make these Northmen\npay!'\n'We must. To that end, we should make ready to advance. We are already behind\nschedule, and the plan relies on precise—'\n'What?' Poulder stared at him as though he suspected West of having gone\nsuddenly insane. 'Move forward? Without orders? Without a clear chain of\ncommand?'\nKroy gave vent to an explosive snort. 'Impossible.'\nPoulder violently shook his head. 'Out of the question, entirely out of the\nquestion.'\n'But Marshal Burr's orders were quite specific—'\n'Circumstances have very plainly altered.' Kroy's face was an expressionless slab.\n'Until I receive explicit instructions from the Closed Council, no one will be moving\nmy division so much as a hair's breadth.'\n'General Poulder, surely you—'\n'In this particular circumstance, I cannot but agree with General Kroy. The army\ncannot move an inch until the Open Council has selected a new king, and the king\nhas appointed a new Lord Marshal.'

Positions which, no doubt,\nuntold numbers of their own men would be killed assaulting once the army finally\nhad a new commander. All an utterly pointless, purposeless waste.

The same feeling that he had when\nhe floundered up in the mist, blood in his eyes, and knew the day was lost. That\nfeeling that he was nothing more than an observer.

Jezal tugged his sweaty collar back and forth, trying\nto let some breath of air into his uniform without moving from his attitude of stiff\nattention.\nThe last time he had stood in this spot, back to the curved wall, had been the day\nthe Guild of Mercers was dissolved. It was hard to imagine that it was little more\nthan a year ago, so much seemed to have happened since.

The\nselection of a new High King of the Union by open vote. He felt a flutter of nerves in\nhis throat at the thought. As occasions went, it was difficult to imagine one bigger.\nThe people of Adua certainly knew it. Beyond the walls, in the streets and\nsquares of the city, they were waiting eagerly for news of the Open Council's\ndecision. Waiting to cheer their new monarch, or perhaps to jeer him, depending on\nthe choice. Beyond the high doors of the Lords' Round, the Square of Marshals was\na single swarming crowd, each man and woman in the Agriont desperate to be the\nfirst to hear word from inside. Futures would be decided, great debts would be\nsettled, fortunes won and lost on the result. Only a lucky fraction had been permitted\ninto the public gallery, but still enough that the spectators were crushed together\naround the balcony, in imminent danger of being shoved over and plunging to the\ntiled floor below.\nThe inlaid doors at the far end of the hall opened with a ringing crash, the echoes\nrebounding from the distant ceiling and booming around the great space. There was\na rustling as every one of the councillors swivelled in his seat to look towards the\nentrance, and then a clatter of feet as the Closed Council approached steadily down\nthe aisle between the benches. A gaggle of secretaries, and clerks, and hangers-on\nhurried after, papers and ledgers clutched in their eager hands. Lord Chamberlain\nHoff strode at their head, frowning grimly. Behind him walked Sult, all in white, and\nMarovia, all in black, their faces equally solemn. Next came Varuz, and Halleck,\nand… Jezal's face fell. Who else but the First of the Magi, attired once again in his\noutrageous wizard's mantle, his apprentice skulking at his elbow. Bayaz grinned as\nthough he were doing nothing more than attending the theatre. Their eyes met, and\nthe Magus had the gall to wink. Jezal was far from amused.\nTo a swelling chorus of mutterings, the old men took their high chairs behind a\nlong, curved table, facing the noblemen on their banked benches. Their aides\narranged themselves on smaller chairs and laid out their papers, opened their books,\nwhispered to their masters in hushed voices. The tension in the hall rose yet another\nstep towards outright hysteria.\nJezal felt a sweaty shiver run up his back. Glokta was there, beside the Arch\nLector, and the familiar face was anything but a reassurance. Jezal had been at\nArdee's house only that morning, and all night too. Needless to say, he had neither\nforsworn her nor proposed marriage. His head spun from going round and round the\nissue. The more time he spent with her, the more impossible any decision seemed to\nbecome."

We cling\nto power by our fingernails—slipping, slipping. We sit like the accused, at our\nown trials. We know the verdict is about to come down. Will it be an ill-deserved\nreprieve? Glokta felt a smile twitch the corner of his mouth. Or an altogether\nbloodier sentence? What say the gentlemen of the jury?\nHis eyes flickered over the faces of the Open Council on their benches. Three\nhundred and twenty faces. Glokta pictured the papers nailed to the Arch Lector's\nwall, and he matched them to the men sitting before him. The secrets, the lies, and\nthe allegiances. The allegiances most of all. Which way will they vote?\nHe saw some whose support he had made certain of. Or as certain as we can be\nin these uncertain times.

Our front\nrunner, keen to spring from the gate. Not far from him was Lord Isher, old and\nstately. The second favourite, still with every chance. Barezin and Heugen sat\nnearby, wedged uncomfortably together and occasionally looking sideways at each\nother with some distaste. Who knows? A late spurt and the throne could be theirs.\nLord Governor Skald sat on the far left, at the front of the delegations from Angland\nand Starikland. New men, from the provinces. But a vote is still a vote, however we\nmight turn our noses up. Over on the far right twelve Aldermen of Westport sat,\nmarked as outsiders by the cut of their clothes and the tone of their skin. Yet a dozen\nvotes still, and undeclared.\nThere were no representatives of Dagoska today. There are none left at all, alas.\nLord Governor Vurms was relieved of his post. His son lost his head and could not\nattend. As for the rest of the city—it was conquered by the Gurkish. Well. Some\nwastage is inevitable. We will struggle on without them. The board is set, the\npieces ready to be moved. Who will be the winner of this sordid little game, do we\nsuppose? We shall soon see…\nThe Announcer stepped forwards into the centre of the circular floor, lifted his\nstaff high above his head and brought it down with a series of mighty crashes that\nechoed from the polished marble walls. The chatter faded, the magnates shuffled\nround to face the floor, every face drawn with tension. A pregnant silence settled\nover the packed hall, and Glokta felt a flurry of twitches slink up the left side of his\nface and set his eyelid blinking.\n'I call this meeting of the Open Council of the Union to order!' thundered the\nAnnouncer. Slowly, and with the grimmest of frowns, Lord Hoff rose to face the\ncouncillors.\n'My friends! My colleagues! My Lords of Midderland, Angland, and Starikland,\nAldermen of Westport! Guslav the Fifth, our King… is dead. His two heirs… are\ndead. One at the hands of our enemies in the north, the other, our enemies in the\nsouth. Truly, this is a time of troubles, and we are left without a leader.' He held his\narms up imploringly to the councillors. 'You are now faced with a grave\nresponsibility. The selection, from among your number, of a new High King of the\nUnion. Any man who holds a chair on this Open Council is a potential candidate!\nAny of you… could be our next King.' A volley of near-hysterical whispers floated\ndown from the public gallery, and Hoff was obliged to raise his voice to shout over\nthem.\n'Such a vote has only been taken once before in the long history of our great\nnation! After the civil war and the fall of Morlic the Mad, when Arnault was raised to\nthe throne by near-unanimous accord. He it was who sired the great dynasty that\nlasted until a few short days ago.'

'Wise was the choice your forebears made that day. We can only hope that the\nman elected here this morning, by and in full view of his peers, will found a dynasty\njust as noble, just as strong, just as even-handed, and just as long-lived!'\nWe can only hope for someone who will do as he's damn well told.\nFerro shoved a woman in a long gown out of her way. She elbowed past a fat man,\nhis jowls trembling with outrage. She forced her way through to the balcony and\nglared down. The wide chamber below was crammed with fur-trimmed old men,\ncrowded together on high banks of seating, each with a sparkling chain round his\nshoulders and a sparkling sheen of sweat across his pale face. Opposite them,\nbehind a curved table, were another set of men, fewer in number. She scowled as\nshe saw Bayaz sitting at one end of them, smiling as if he knew some secret that no\none else could guess.\nJust like always.\nBeside him stood a fat pink with a face full of broken veins, shouting something\nabout each man voting with his conscience. Ferro snorted. She would have been\nsurprised if the few hundred men down there had five whole consciences between\nthem. It seemed as if they were all attending carefully to the fat man's address, but\nFerro saw differently.\nThe room was full of signals.\nMen glanced sideways at one another and gave subtle nods. They winked with\none eye or the other. They touched forefingers to noses and ears. They scratched in\nstrange ways. A web of secrets, spreading out to every part of the chamber, and\nwith Bayaz sitting grinning in the midst of it. Some way behind him, with his back to\nthe wall, Jezal dan Luthar was standing in a uniform festooned with shiny thread.\nFerro curled her lip. She could see it in the way he stood.\nHe had learned nothing.\nThe Announcer stabbed at the floor with his stick again. 'Voting will now begin!'\nThere was a ragged groan and Ferro saw the woman she had pushed past earlier\nslide to the floor in a faint. Someone dragged her away, flapping a piece of paper in\nher face, and the ill-tempered press closed in tight behind. 'In the first round the field\nwill be narrowed to three choices! There will be a show of hands for each candidate\nin order of the most extensive lands and holdings!'\nDown below on their benches, the richly dressed sweated and trembled like men\nbefore a battle.\n'Firstly!' shrieked a clerk, voice cracking as he consulted an enormous ledger,\n'Lord Brock!'\nUp in the gallery people mopped their faces, muttering and gasping as if they\nwere facing death. Perhaps some of them were. The whole place reeked of doubt,\nand excitement, and terror. So strong it was contagious. So strong that even Ferro,\nwho did not care a shit for the pinks and their damn vote, felt her mouth dry, her\nfingers itching, her heart thumping fast."

'The first candidate will be Lord\nBrock! All those members of the Open Council who wish to vote for Lord Brock as\nthe next High King of the Union, will you please raise your—'\n'One moment, my Lords!'\nGlokta jerked his head round, but his neck-bones stuck halfway and he had to peer\nfrom the corner of one dewy eye. He need hardly have bothered. I could have\nguessed without looking who spoke. Bayaz had risen from his chair and was now\nsmiling indulgently towards the Open Council. With perfect timing. A volley of\noutraged calls rose up from its members in response.\n'This is no time for interruptions!'\n'Lord Brock! I vote for Brock!'\n'A new dynasty!'\nBayaz' smile did not slip a hair's breadth. 'But what if the old dynasty could\ncontinue? What if we could make a new beginning,' and he glanced significantly\nacross the faces of his colleagues on the Closed Council, 'while keeping all that is\ngood in our present government? What if there was a way to heal wounds, rather\nthan to cause them?'\n'How?' came the mocking calls.\n'What way?'\nBayaz' smile grew broader yet, 'Why, a royal bastard.'\nThere was a collective gasp. Lord Brock bounced from his seat. Quite as if he\nhad a spring under his arse. 'This is an insult to this house! A scandal! A slur on\nthe memory of King Guslav!' Indeed, he now seems not only a drooling vegetable,\nbut a lecherous one. Other councillors rose to join him, faces red with outrage,\nwhite with fury, shaking fists and making angry calls. The whole sweep of benches\nseemed to honk and grunt and wriggle. Just like the pigpens at the slaughterhouse,\nclamouring for any swill on offer.\n'Wait!' shrieked the Arch Lector, his white-gloved hands raised in entreaty.\nSensing some faint glimmer of hope in the darkness, perhaps? 'Wait, my Lords!\nThere is nothing to be lost by listening! We shall have the truth here, even if it is\npainful! The truth should be our only concern!' Glokta had to chomp his gums down\non a splutter of laughter. Oh, of course, your Eminence! The truth has ever been\nyour only care!\nBut the babble gradually subsided. Those councillors who were on their feet were\nshamed back into line. Their habit of obedience to the Closed Council is not easily\nbroken. But then habits never are. Especially of obedience. Only ask my mother's\ndogs. They grumbled their way back into their seats, and allowed Bayaz to continue.\n'Your Lordships have perhaps heard of Carmee dan Roth?' A swell of noise from\nthe gallery above confirmed that the name was not unfamiliar. 'She was a great\nfavourite with the King, when he was younger. A very great favourite.

I have always had one eye on its\nwelfare, despite the scant thanks I have received for it.' And Bayaz gave the very\nbriefest curl of his lip towards the members of the Closed Council. 'So, when the\nlady died in childbirth, I took the King's bastard into my care. I placed him with a\nnoble family, to be well raised and well educated, in case the nation should one day\nfind itself without an heir. My actions now seem prudent indeed.'\n'Lies!' someone shrieked. 'Lies!' But few voices joined in. Their tone instead was\none of curiosity.\n'A natural son?'\n'A bastard?'\n'Carmee dan Roth, did he say?'\nThey have heard this tale before. Rumours, perhaps, but familiar ones.\nFamiliar enough to make them listen. To make them judge whether it will be in\ntheir interests to believe.\nBut Lord Brock was not convinced. 'A blatant fabrication! It will take more than\nrumour and conjecture to sway this house! Produce this bastard, if you can,\nso-called First of the Magi! Work your magic!'\n'No magic is needful,' sneered Bayaz. 'The King's son is already with us in the\nchamber.' Gasps of consternation from the gallery, sighs of amazement from the\ncouncillors, stunned silence from the Closed Council and their aides, every eye fixed\non Bayaz' pointing finger as he swept out his hand towards the wall. 'No other man\nthan Colonel Jezal dan Luthar!'\nThe spasm began in Glokta's toeless foot, shot up his ruined leg, set his twisted\nspine shivering from his arse right to his skull, made his face twitch like an angry\njelly, made his few teeth rattle in his empty gums, set his eyelid flickering fast as a\nfly's wings.\nThe echoes of Bayaz' last utterance whispered round the suddenly silent hall.\n'Luthar, Luthar, Luthar…'\nYou must be fucking joking.\nThe pale faces of the councillors were frozen, hanging in wide-eyed shock, squashed\nup in narrow-eyed rage. The pale men behind the table gaped. The pale people at the\nbalcony pressed their hands over their mouths. Jezal dan Luthar, who had wept with\nself-pity while Ferro had stitched his face. Jezal dan Luthar, that leaky piss-pot of\nselfishness, and arrogance, and vanity. Jezal dan Luthar, who she had called the\nprincess of the Union, had a chance of ending the day as its King.\nFerro could not help herself.\nShe let her head drop back and she hacked, and coughed, and gurgled with\namusement. Tears sprung up in her eyes, her chest shook and her knees trembled.\nShe clung to the rail of the balcony, she gasped, blubbered, drooled. Ferro did not\nlaugh often. She could scarcely remember the last time. But Jezal dan Luthar, a\nKing?\nThis was funny.\nHigh above, in the public gallery, someone had started laughing. A jagged cackling"

        "text": "King?\nThis was funny.\nHigh above, in the public gallery, someone had started laughing. A jagged cackling\ncompletely inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment. But Jezal's first impulse,\nwhen he realised that it was his name that Bayaz had called out, when he realised that\nit was him the outstretched finger was pointing to, was to join in. His second, as\nevery face in the entire vast space turned instantly towards him, was to vomit. The\nresult was an ungainly cough, a shame-faced grin, an unpleasant burning at the very\nback of the mouth, and an instant paling of the complexion.\n'I…' he found himself croaking, but without the slightest idea of how he would\ncontinue his sentence. What words could possibly help at a time like this? All he\ncould do was stand there, sweating profusely, trembling under his stiff uniform, as\nBayaz continued in ringing tones, his voice cutting over the laughter bubbling down\nfrom above.\n'I have the sworn statement of his adoptive father here, attesting that all I say is\ntrue, but does it matter? The truth of it is plain for any man to see!' His arm shot out\ntowards Jezal again. 'He won a Contest before you all, and accompanied me on a\njourney full of peril with never a complaint! He charged the bridge at Darmium,\nwithout a thought for his own safety! He saved Adua from the revolt without a drop\nof blood spilled! His valour and his prowess, his wisdom and his selflessness are\nwell known to all! Can it be doubted that the blood of kings flows in his veins?'\nJezal blinked. Odd facts began to bob to the surface of his sluggish mind. He\nwas not much like his brothers. His father had always treated him differently. He had\ngot all the looks in the family. His mouth was hanging open, but he found he could\nnot close it. When his father had seen Bayaz, at the Contest, he had turned white as\nmilk, as though he recognised him.\nHe had done, and he was not Jezal's father at all.\nWhen the king had congratulated Jezal on his victory, he had mistaken him for his\nown son. Not such blinding folly, evidently, as everyone might have thought. The\nold fool had been closer to the mark than anyone. Suddenly, it all made horrible\nsense.\nHe was a bastard. Literally.\nHe was the natural son of a king. What was much more, he was slowly and with\nincreasing terror beginning to realise, he was now being seriously considered as his\nreplacement.\n'My Lords!' shouted Bayaz over the disbelieving chatter gaining steadily in\nvolume with every passing moment. 'You sit amazed! It is a difficult fact to accept, I\ncan understand. Especially with the suffocating heat in here!' He signalled to the\nguards at both ends of the hall. 'Open the gates, please, and let us have some air!'\nThe doors were heaved open and a gentle breeze washed into the Lords' Round.\nA cooling breeze, and something else with it. Hard to make out at first, and then\ncoming more clearly. Something like the noise of the crowd at the Contest. Soft,\nrepetitive, and more than a little frightening."

Soft,\nrepetitive, and more than a little frightening.\n'Luthar! Luthar! Luthar!' The sound of his own name, chanted over and over\nfrom a multitude of throats beyond the walls of the Agriont, was unmistakable.\nBayaz grinned. 'It would seem that the people of the city have already chosen\ntheir favoured candidate.'\n'This is not their choice!' roared Brock, still on his feet but only now regaining his\ncomposure. 'Any more than it is yours!'\n'But it would be foolish to ignore their opinion. The support of the commoners\ncannot be lightly dismissed, especially in these restless times. If they were to be\ndisappointed, in their current mood, who knows what might occur? Riots in the\nstreets, or worse? None of us wants that, surely, Lord Brock?'\nSeveral of the councillors shifted nervously on their benches, glancing towards\nthe open doors, whispering to their neighbours, if the atmosphere in the Round had\nbeen confused before, it was flabbergasted now. But the worry and surprise of the\nOpen Council was nothing compared to Jezal's own.\nA fascinating tale, but if he supposes that the Union's greediest men will simply\ntake his word for it and give the crown away he has made a staggering blunder,\nwhether commoners wet themselves at the name of Luthar or not. Lord Isher rose\nfrom the front row for the first time, stately and magnificent, the jewels on his chain\nof office flashing. And so the furious objections, the outraged denials, the demands\nfor punishment begin.\n'I wholeheartedly believe!' called Isher in ringing tones, 'that the man known as\nColonel Jezal dan Luthar is none other than the natural child of the recently deceased\nKing Guslav the Fifth!' Glokta gawped. So, it seemed, did almost everyone else in\nthe chamber. 'And that he is further fitted for rule on account of his exemplary\ncharacter and extensive achievements, both within the Union and outside it!' Another\npeal of ugly laughter gurgled down from above, but Isher ignored it. 'My vote, and\nthe votes of my supporters, are wholeheartedly for Luthar!'\nIf Luthar's eyes had gone any wider they might have dropped from his skull. And\nwho can blame him? Now one of the Westport delegation was on his feet. 'The\nAldermen of Westport vote as one man for Luthar!' he sang out in his Styrian\naccent. 'Natural son and heir to King Guslav the Fifth!'\nA man jumped up a few rows back. He glanced quickly and somewhat nervously\nat Glokta. None other than Lord Ingelstad. The lying little shit, what's he about? 'I\nam for Luthar!' he shrieked.\n'And I, for Luthar!' Wetterlant, his hooded eyes giving away no more emotion\nthan they had when he fed the ducks.

He had a faint smile on his face as he watched others\nspring from their benches to declare their support for the so-called natural son of\nGuslav the Fifth. Meanwhile, the chanting of the crowds out in the city could still be\nheard.\n'Luthar! Luthar! Luthar!'\nAs the shock drained away, Glokta's mind began to turn. So that is why our First\nof the Magi cheated in the Contest on Luthar's behalf. That is why he has kept\nhim close, all this time. That is why he procured for him so notable a command. If\nhe had presented some nobody as the King's son, he would have been laughed\nfrom the chamber. But Luthar, love him or hate him, is one of us. He is known, he\nis familiar, he is… acceptable. Glokta looked at Bayaz with something close to\nadmiration. Pieces of a puzzle, patient years in the preparation, calmly slotted into\nplace before our disbelieving eyes. And not a thing that we can do, except,\nperhaps, to dance along to his tune?\nSult leaned sideways in his chair and hissed urgently in Glokta's ear. 'This boy,\nLuthar, what manner of a man is he?'\nGlokta frowned over at him, standing dumbstruck by the wall. He looked at that\nmoment as if he could scarcely be trusted to control his own bowels, let alone a\ncountry. Still, you could have said much the same for our previous King, and he\ndischarged his duties admirably. His duties of sitting and drooling, while we ran\nthe country for him. 'Before his trip abroad, your Eminence, he was as\nempty-headed, spineless and vain a young fool as one might hope to find in the\nentire nation. The last time I spoke to him, though—'\n'Perfect!'\n'But, your Eminence, you must see that this is all according to Bayaz' plans—'\n'We will deal with that old fool later. I am taking advice.' Sult turned to hiss at\nMarovia without waiting for a reply. Now the two old men looked out at the Open\nCouncil, now they gave their nods and their signals to the men they controlled. All\nthe while, Bayaz smiled. The way an engineer might smile as his new machine\nworks for the first time, precisely according to his design. The Magus caught\nGlokta's eye, and gave the faintest of nods. There was nothing for Glokta to do but\nshrug, and give a toothless grin of his own. I wonder if the time may come when we\nall wish we had voted for Brock.\nNow Marovia was speaking hurriedly to Hoff. The Lord Chamberlain frowned,\nnodded, turned towards the house and signalled to the Announcer, who beat\nfuriously on the floor for silence.\n'My Lords of the Open Council!' Hoff roared, once something resembling quiet\nhad been established. 'The discovery of a natural son plainly changes the\ncomplexion of this debate! Fate would appear to have gifted us the opportunity to\ncontinue the dynasty of Arnault without further doubt or conflict!' Fate gifts us? I\nrather think we have a less disinterested benefactor.

A single vote,\non whether the man previously known as Jezal dan Luthar should be declared High\nKing of the Union forthwith!'\n'No!' roared Brock, veins bulging from his neck. 'I strongly protest!' But he might\nas well have protested against the incoming tide. The arms were already shooting up\nin daunting numbers. The Aldermen of Westport, the supporters of Lord Isher, the\nvotes that Sult and Marovia had bullied and bribed their way. Glokta saw many\nmore, now, men he had thought undecided, or firmly declared for one man or\nanother. All lending their support to Luthar with a speed that strongly implies a\nprevious arrangement. Bayaz sat back, arms folded, as he watched the hands shoot\nskywards. It was already becoming terribly clear that over half of the room was in\nfavour.\n'Yes!' hissed the Arch Lector, a smile of triumph on his face. 'Yes!'\nThose who had not raised their arms, men committed to Brock, or Barezin, or\nHeugen, stared about them, stunned and not a little horrified at how quickly the\nworld seemed to have passed them by. How quickly the chance at power has\nslipped through their fingers. And who can blame them? It has been a surprising\nday for us all.\nLord Brock made one last effort, raising a finger to stab at Luthar, still goggling\nby the wall. 'What proof have you that he is the son of anyone in particular, beside\nthe word of this old liar?' and he gestured at Bayaz. 'What proof, my Lords? I\ndemand proof!'\nAngry mutterings swept up and down the benches, but no one made themselves\nconspicuous. The second time Lord Brock has stood before this Council and\ndemanded proof, and the second time no one has cared. What proof could there\nbe, after all? A birthmark on Luthar's arse in the shape of a crown? Proof is\nboring. Proof is tiresome. Proof is an irrelevance. People would far rather be\nhanded an easy lie than search for a difficult truth, especially if it suits their own\npurposes. And most of us would far rather have a King with no friends and no\nenemies, than a King with plenty of both. Most of us would rather have things stay\nas they are, than risk an uncertain future.\nMore hands were raised, and more. Luthar's support had rolled too far for any\none man to stop it. Now it is like a great boulder hurtling down a slope. They dare\nnot stand in its way in case they are squashed to gravy. So they crowd in behind,\nand add their own weight to it, and hope to snatch the scraps up afterward.\nBrock turned, a deadly frown across his face, and he stormed down the aisle and\nout of the chamber. Probably he had hoped that a good part of the Open Council\nwould storm out with him. But in that, as in so much else today, he must he\nharshly disappointed.

Their march had begun gently as they came up through the\nwoods, a rise you'd hardly notice. Then the trees thinned out and their path took\nthem up a valley between grassy fells, cracked with trickling streams, patched with\nsedge and gorse. Now the valley had narrowed to a gorge, hemmed in on both sides\nwith slopes of bare rock and crumbling scree, getting always steeper. Above them,\non either side of that gorge, two great crags rose up. Beyond, the hazy hints of\nmountain peaks—grey, and light grey, and even lighter grey, melted in the distance\ninto the heavy grey sky.\nThe sun was out, and meaning business, and it was hot to walk in, bright to\nsquint into. They were all weary from climbing, and worrying, and looking behind\nthem for Bethod. Four hundred Carls, maybe, and as many painted-face hillmen, all\nspread out in a great long column, cursing and spitting, boots crunching and sliding\nin the dry dirt and the loose stones. Crummock's daughter was struggling up ahead\nof Logen, bent double under the weight of her father's hammer, hair round her face\ndark with sweat. Logen's own daughter would have been older than that, by now. If\nshe hadn't been killed by the Shanka, along with her mother and her brothers. That\nthought gave Logen a hollow, guilty feeling. A bad one.\n'You want a hand with that mallet, girl?'\n'No I fucking don't!' she screamed at him, then dropped it off her shoulder and\ndragged it away up the slope by the handle, scowling at him all the way, the\nhammer's head clattering along and leaving a groove in the stony soil. Logen blinked\nafter her. Seemed his touch with the women went all the way down to ones ten years\nold.\nCrummock came up behind him, fingerbones swinging round his neck. 'Fierce,\nah? Y'ave to be fierce, to get on in my family!' He leaned close and gave a wink.\n'And she's the fiercest of the lot, that little bitch. If I'm honest, she's my favourite.'\nHe shook his head as he watched her dragging at that hammer. 'She'll make some\npoor bastard one hell of a wife one day.

'Where's\nthe—'\nThen he realised. Crummock's fortress, if you could call it that, was right ahead\nof them.\nThe valley was no more than a hundred strides now from one cliff to the other,\nand a wall was built across it. An ancient and crumbling wall of rough blocks, so full\nof cracks, so coated with creeper, brambles, seeding grass, that it seemed almost\npart of the mountains. It wasn't a whole lot steeper than the valley itself, and as tall as\nthree men on each other's shoulders at its highest, sagging here and there as if it was\nabout to fall down on its own. In the centre was a gate of weathered grey planks,\nsplattered with lichen, managing to seem rotten and dried-out both at once.\nTo one side of the wall there was a tower, built up against the cliff. Or at least\nthere was a great natural pillar sticking out from the rock with half-cut chunks of\nstone mortared to the top, making a wide platform on the cliff-side, overlooking the\nwall from high above. Logen looked at the Dogman as he trudged up, and the\nDogman squinted at that wall as if he couldn't believe what he was seeing.\n'This is it?' growled Dow, coming up next to them, his lip curling. A few trees\nhad taken root at one side, just under the tower, must have been fifty years ago at\nleast. Now they loomed up over the wall. A man could have climbed them easily,\nand stepped inside the place without even stretching far.\nTul stared up at the ragged excuse for a fortress. 'A strong place in the\nmountains, you said.'\n'Strong… ish.' Crummock waved his hand. 'We hillmen have never been much\nfor building and so on. What were you expecting?

You're\ndamn right I want a wall, and you told us there'd be one!'\n'But you said it yourself friend.' Crummock spoke soft and slow as though he\nwas explaining it to a child, and he tapped at the side of his head with one thick\nfinger. 'I'm mad! Mad as a sack of owls, and everyone says so! I can't remember the\nnames of my own children. Who knows what I think a wall looks like? I hardly know\nwhat I'm talking of myself, most of the time, and you're fool enough to listen to me?\nYou must be mad yourselves!'\nLogen rubbed at the bridge of his nose and he gave a groan.

It was a\nlong, hot walk they'd had to find this at the end of it. But they had no choices, as far\nas he could see. 'It's a bit late to build a better one,' he grumbled. 'We'll have to do\nwhat we can with what we've got.'\n'That's it Bloody-Nine, you need no wall and you know it!' Crummock clapped\nLogen on the arm with his great fat hand. 'You cannot die! You're beloved of the\nmoon, my fine new friend, above all others! You cannot die, not with the moon\nlooking over you! You cannot—'\n'Shut up,' said Logen.\nThey crunched sourly across the slope towards the gate. Crummock called out\nand the old doors wobbled open. A pair of suspicious hillmen stood on the other\nside, watching them come in. They slogged up a steep ramp cut into the rock, all\ntired and grumbling, and came out into a flat space above. A saddle between the two\ncrags, might have been a hundred strides wide and two hundred long, sheer cliffs of\nstone all round. There were a few wooden shacks and sheds scattered about the\nedges, all green with old moss, a slumping stone hall built against the rock face with\nsmoke rising out of a squat chimney. Just next to it a narrow stair was cut into the\ncliff, climbing up to the platform at the top of the tower.\n'Nowhere to run to,' Logen muttered, 'if things turn sour.'\nCrummock only grinned the wider. 'Course not. That's the whole point, ain't it?\nBethod'll think he's got us like beetles in a bottle.'\n'He will have,' growled the Dogman.\n'Aye, but then your friends will come up behind him and won't he get the father\nof all shocks, though? It'll almost be worth it for the look on his face, the shit-eating\nbastard!'\nLogen worked his mouth and spat onto the stony ground. 'I wonder what the\nlooks on our faces'll be by then? All slack and corpse-like would be my guess.' A\nherd of shaggy sheep were pressed in tight together in a pen, staring around\nwide-eyed, bleating to each other. Hemmed in and helpless, and Logen knew exactly\nhow they felt. From inside the fort, where the ground was a good deal higher, there\nwas hardly a wall at all. You could've stepped up onto its walkway, if you'd got long\nlegs, and stood at its crumbling, moss-ridden excuse for a parapet.\n'Don't you worry your beautiful self about nothing, Bloody-Nine,' laughed\nCrummock. 'My fortress could be better built, I'll grant you, but the ground is with\nus, and the mountains, and the moon, all smiling on our bold endeavour. This is a\nstrong place, with a strong history. Do you not know the story of Laffa the Brave?'\n'Can't say that I do.' Logen wasn't altogether sure he wanted to hear it now, but\nhe was in the long habit of not getting what he wanted."

        "text": "'Can't say that I do.' Logen wasn't altogether sure he wanted to hear it now, but\nhe was in the long habit of not getting what he wanted.\n'Laffa was a great bandit chief of the hillmen, a long time ago. He raided all the\nclans around for years, him and his brothers. One hot summer the clans had enough,\nso they banded together and hunted him in the mountains. Here's where he made his\nlast stand. Right here in this fortress. Laffa and his brothers and all his people.'\n'What happened?' asked Dogman.\n'They all got killed, and their heads cut off and put in a sack, and the sack was\nburied in the pit they used to shit in.' Crummock beamed. 'Guess that's why they call\nit a last stand, eh?'\n'That's it? That's the story?'\n'That's all of it that I know, but I'm not right sure what else there could be. That\nwas pretty much the end for Laffa, I'd say.'\n'Thanks for the encouragement.'\n'That's alright, that's alright! I've more stories, if you need more!'\n'No, no, that's enough for me.' Logen turned and started walking off, the Dogman\nbeside him. 'You can tell me more once we've won!'\n'Ha ha, Bloody-Nine!' shouted Crummock after him, 'that'll be a story in itself,\neh? You can't fool me! You're like I am, beloved of the moon! We fight hardest\nwhen our backs are to the mountains and there's no way out! Tell me it ain't so! We\nlove it when we got no choices!'\n'Oh aye,' Logen muttered to himself as he stalked off towards the gate. 'There's\nnothing better than no choices.'\nDogman stood at the foot o' the wall, staring up at it, and wondering what to do to\ngive him and the rest a better chance at living out the week.\n'It'd be a good thing to get all this creeper and grass cleared off it,' he said.\n'Makes it a damn sight easier to climb.'\nTul raised an eyebrow. 'You sure it ain't all that plant that's holding it together?'\nGrim tugged at a vine and a shower of dried-out mortar came with it.\n'Might be you're right.' Dogman sighed. 'Cut off what we can, then, eh? Some\nwork at the top would be time well spent and all. Be nice to have a decent stack o'\nstones to hide behind when Bethod starts shooting arrows at us.'\n'That it would,' said Tul. 'And we could dig us a ditch down here in front, plant\nsome stakes round the bottom, make it harder for 'era to get up close.'\n'Then close that gate, nail it shut, and wedge a load of rocks in behind it.'\n'We'll have trouble getting out,' said Tul.\nLogen snorted. 'Us getting out won't be the pressing problem, I'm thinking.'\n'You've a point right there,' laughed Crummock, ambling up with a lit pipe in his\nfat fist. 'It's Bethod's boys getting in that we should worry on.'\n'Getting these walls patched up would be a good start at settling my mind.'"

'It's Bethod's boys getting in that we should worry on.'\n'Getting these walls patched up would be a good start at settling my mind.'\nDogman pointed at the trees grown up over the wall. 'We need to get these cut down\nand cut up, carve us out some stone, mix us some mortar and all the rest.\nCrummock, you got people can do that? You got tools?'\nHe puffed at his pipe, frowning at Dogman all the long while, then blew brown\nsmoke. 'I might have, but I won't take my orders from such as you, Dogman. The\nmoon knows my talents, and they're for murder, not mortaring.' Grim rolled his eyes.\n'Who will you take orders from?' asked Logen.\n'I'll take 'em from you, Bloody-Nine, and from no other! The moon loves you,\nand I love the moon, and you're the man for—'\n'Then get your people together and get to fucking cutting wood and stone. I'm\nbored o' your blather.'\nCrummock knocked out his ashes sourly against the wall. 'You're no fun at all,\nyou boys, you do nothing but worry. You need to think on the sunny side o' this.\nThe worst that can happen is that Bethod don't show!'\n'The worst?' Dogman stared at him. 'You sure? What about if Bethod does\ncome, and his Carls kick your wall over like a pile o' turds and kill every last one of\nus?'\nCrummock's brow furrowed. He frowned down at the ground. He squinted up at\nthe clouds. 'True,' he said, breaking out in a smile. 'That is worse. You got a fast\nmind, lad.'\nDogman gave a long sigh, and stared down into the valley. The wall might not\nhave been all they'd hoped for, but you couldn't knock the position. Coming up that\nsteep slope against a set of hard men, high above and with nothing to lose, ready and\nmore'n able to kill you. That was no one's idea o' fun.\n'Tough to get organised down there,' said Logen, speaking Dog-man's own\nthoughts. 'Specially with arrows plunging on you from above and nothing to hide\nbehind. Hard to make numbers count. I wouldn't much fancy trying it myself. How\nare we going to work it, if they come?'\n'I reckon we'll make three crews.' Dogman nodded to the tower. 'Me up there\nwith five score or so o' the best archers. Good spot to shoot from, that. Nice and\nhigh, and a good view of the front o' the wall.'\n'Uh,' said Grim.\n'Maybe some strong lads to throw a rock or two.'\n'I'll lob a rock,' said Tul.\n'Fair enough. Then the pick of our lads up on the wall, ready to take 'em on hand\nto hand, if they get up there. That'll be your crew, I reckon, Logen. Dow and Shivers\nand Red Hat can be your seconds.'\nLogen nodded, not looking all that happy. 'Aye, alright.'\n'Then Crummock up behind with his hillmen, ready to charge if they make it"

Hillmen on the\nwall, Logen and the rest behind.'\n'That's quite the plan for a little man!' Crummock clapped him on the shoulder\nwith a huge hand and damn near knocked him on his face. 'Like as not you had it\nfrom the moon while you slept! Ain't one thing in it I'd change!' He slapped his\nmeaty fist into his palm. 'I love a good charge! I hope the Southerners don't come,\nand leave more for the rest of us! I want to charge now!'\n'Good for you,' grunted Dogman. 'Maybe we can find you a cliff to charge off.'\nHe squinted into the sun, taking another look up at the wall that held all of their\nhopes. He wouldn't have cared to try and climb it, not from this side, but it wasn't\nhalfway as high, or as thick, or as strong as he'd have liked. You don't always get\nthings the way you like, Threetrees would have said. But just once would've been\nnice.\n'The trap is ready,' said Crummock, grinning down into the valley.\nThe Dogman nodded. 'The only question is who'll get caught in it. Bethod? Or\nus?'\nLogen walked through the night, between the fires. Some fires had Carls round them,\ndrinking Crummock's beer, and smoking his chagga, and laughing at stories. Others\nhad hillmen, looking like wolves in the shifting light with their rough furs, their tangled\nhair, their half-painted faces. One was singing, somewhere. Strange songs in a\nstrange tongue that yapped and warbled like the animals in the forest, rose and fell\nlike the valleys and the peaks. Logen had to admit he'd been smoking, for the first\ntime in a while, and drinking too. Everything felt warm. The fires, and the men, and\nthe cool wind, even. He wove his way through the dark, looking for the fire where\nthe Dogman and the rest were sitting, and not having a clue which way to find it. He\nwas lost, and in more ways than one.\n'How many men you killed, Da?' Had to be Crummock's daughter. There weren't\ntoo many high voices round that camp, more was the pity. Logen saw the hillman's\ngreat shape in the darkness, his three children sitting near him, their outsize weapons\npropped up in easy reach.\n'Oh, I've killed a legion of 'em, Isern.' Crummock's great deep voice rumbled out\nat Logen as he came closer. 'More'n I can remember. Your father might not have all\nhis wits all the time, but he's a bad enemy to have. One of the worst. You'll see the\ntruth of that close up, when Bethod and his arse-lickers come calling.' He looked up\nand saw Logen coming through the night. 'I swear, and I don't doubt Bethod would"

'I swear, and I don't doubt Bethod would\nswear with me, there's only one bastard in all the North who's nastier, and bloodier,\nand harder than your father.'\n'Who's that?' asked the boy with the shield. Logen felt his heart sinking as\nCrummock's arm lifted up to point towards him.\n'Why, that's him there. The Bloody-Nine.'\nThe girl glared at Logen. 'He's nothing. You could have him, Da!'\n'By the dead, not me! Don't even say it girl, in case I make a piss-puddle big\nenough to drown you in.'\n'He don't look like much.'\n'And there's a lesson for all three of you. Not looking much, not saying much, not\nseeming much, that's a good first step in being dangerous, eh, Ninefingers? Then\nwhen you let the devil go free it's twice the shock for whatever poor bastard's on the\nend of it. Shock and surprise, my little beauties, and quickness to strike, and lack of\npity. These are the things that make a killer. Size, and strength, and a big loud voice\nare alright in their place, but they're nothing to that murderous, monstrous, merciless\nspeed, eh, Bloody-Nine?'\nIt was a hard lesson for children, but Logen's father had taught it to him young,\nand he'd kept it in mind all these years. 'It's a sorry fact. He who strikes first often\nstrikes last.'\n'That he does!' shouted Crummock, slapping his great thigh. 'Well said! But it's a\nhappy fact, not a sorry one. You remember old Wilum, don't you, my children?'\n'Thunder got him!' shouted the boy with the shield, 'in a storm, up in the High\nPlaces!'\n'That it did! One moment he's standing there, the next there's a noise like the\nworld falling and a flash like the sun, and Wilum's dead as my boots!'\n'His feet was on fire!' laughed the girl.\n'That they were, Isern. You saw how fast he died, how much the shock, how little\nthe mercy that the lightning showed, well.' And Crummock's eyes slid across to\nLogen. 'That's what it'd be to cross that man there. One moment you'd say your\nhard word, the next?' He clapped his hands together with a crack and made the three\nchildren jump. 'He'd send you back to the mud. Faster than the sky killed Wilum,\nand with no more regret. Your life hangs on a thread, every moment you stand within\ntwo strides of that nothing-looking bastard there, does it not, Bloody-Nine?'\n'Well…' Logen wasn't much enjoying this.\n'How many men you killed then?' the girl shouted at him, sticking her chin out.\nCrummock laughed and rubbed his hand in her hair. 'The numbers aren't made to\ncount that high, Isern! He's the king of killers! No man made more deadly, not\nanywhere under the moon.'\n'What about that Feared?' asked the boy with the spear."

He's something else. But I wonder. Fenris the Feared and the Bloody-Nine,\nsetting to kill one another?' He rubbed his hands together. 'Now that is a thing I\nwould like to see. That is a thing the moon would love to shine upon.' His eyes\nrolled up towards the sky and Logen followed them with his own. The moon was up\nthere, sitting in the black heavens, big and white, glowing like new fire.\nHorrible Old Men\n« ^ »\nThe tall windows stood open, allowing a merciful breeze to wash through the wide\nsalon, to give the occasional cooling kiss to Jezal's sweating face, to make the vast,\nantique hangings flap and rustle. Everything in the chamber was outsized—the\ncavernous doorways were three times as high as a man, and the ceiling, painted with\nthe peoples of the world bowing down before an enormous golden sun, was twice\nas high again. The immense canvases on the walls featured life-size figures in\nassorted majestic poses, whose warlike expressions would give Jezal uncomfortable\nshocks whenever he turned around.\nIt seemed a space for great men, for wise men, for epic heroes or mighty villains.\nA space for giants. Jezal felt a tiny, meagre, stupid fool in it.\n'Your arm, if it please your Majesty,' murmured one of the tailors, managing to\ngive Jezal orders while remaining crushingly sycophantic.\n'Yes, of course… I'm sorry.' Jezal raised his arm a little higher, inwardly cursing\nat having apologised yet again. He was a king now, as Bayaz was constantly telling\nhim. If he had shoved one of the tailors out of the window, no apology would have\nbeen necessary. The man would probably have thanked him profusely for the\nattention as he plummeted to the ground. As it was he merely gave a wooden smile,\nand smoothly unravelled his measuring tape. His colleague was crawling below,\ndoing something similar around Jezal's knees. The third was punctiliously recording\ntheir observations in a marbled ledger.\nJezal took a long breath, and frowned into the mirror. An uncertain-seeming\nyoung idiot with a scar on his chin gazed back at him from the glass, draped with\nswatches of glittering cloth as though he were a tailor's dummy. He looked, and\ncertainly felt, more like a clown than a king. He looked a joke, and undoubtedly\nwould have laughed, had he not himself been the ridiculous punch-line.\n'Perhaps something after the Osprian fashion, then?' The Royal Jeweller placed\nanother wooden nonsense carefully on Jezal's head and examined the results. It was\nfar from an improvement. The damn thing looked like nothing so much as an\ninverted chandelier.\n'No, no!' snapped Bayaz, with some irritation. 'Far too fancy, far too clever, far\ntoo big.

It needs to be simple, to\nbe honest, to be light. Something a man could fight in!'\nThe Royal Jeweller blinked. 'He will be fighting in the crown?'\n'No, dolt! But he must look as if he might!' Bayaz came up behind Jezal, snatched\nthe wooden contraption from his head and tossed it rattling on the polished floor.\nThen he seized Jezal by the arms and stared grimly at his reflection from over his\nshoulder. 'This is a warrior king in the finest tradition! The natural heir to the\nKingdom of Harod the Great! A peerless swordsman, who has dealt wounds and\nreceived them, who has led armies to victory, who has killed men by the score!'\n'Score?' murmured Jezal, uncertainly.\nBayaz ignored him. 'A man as comfortable with saddle and sword as with throne\nand sceptre! His crown must go with armour. It must go with weapons. It must go\nwith steel. Now do you understand?'\nThe Jeweller nodded slowly. 'I believe so, my Lord.'\n'Good. And one more thing.'\n'My Lord has but to name it.'\n'Give it a big-arsed diamond.'\nThe Jeweller humbly inclined his head. 'That goes without saying.'\n'Now out. Out, all of you! His Majesty has affairs of state to attend to.'\nThe ledger was snapped shut, the tapes were rolled up in a moment, the swatches\nof cloth were whisked away. The tailors and the Royal Jeweller bowed their way\nbackwards from the room with a range of servile mutterings, whisking the huge,\ngilt-encrusted doors silently shut. Jezal had to stop himself from leaving with them.\nHe kept forgetting that he was now his Majesty.\n'I have business?' he asked, turning from the mirror and trying his best to sound\noffhand and masterful.\nBayaz ushered him out into the great hallway outside, its walls covered in\nbeautifully rendered maps of the Union. 'You have business with your Closed\nCouncil.'\nJezal swallowed. The very name of the institution was daunting. Standing in\nmarble chambers, being measured for new clothes, being called your Majesty, all of\nthis was bemusing, but hardly required a great effort on his part. Now he was\nexpected to sit at the very heart of government. Jezal dan Luthar, once widely\ncelebrated for his towering ignorance, would be sharing a room with the twelve most\npowerful men in the Union. He would be expected to make decisions that would\naffect the lives of thousands. To hold his own in the arenas of politics, and law, and\ndiplomacy, when his only areas of true expertise were fencing, drink, and women,\nand he was forced to concede that, in that last area at least, he did not seem to be\nquite the expert he had once reckoned himself.\n'The Closed Council?' His voice shot up to a register more girlish than kingly,\nand he was forced to clear his throat. 'Is there some particular matter of importance?'\nhe growled in an unconvincing bass.\n'Some momentous news arrived from the North earlier today.'"

Down here, your\nMajesty.'\n'Hours?' muttered Jezal, his boot-heels clicking down a set of wide marble steps.\nHours in the company of the Closed Council. He rubbed his hands nervously\ntogether.\nBayaz seemed to guess his thoughts. 'There is no need for you to fear those old\nwolves. You are their master, whatever they may have come to believe. At any time\nyou can replace them, or have them dragged away in irons, for that matter, should\nyou desire. Perhaps they have forgotten it. It might be that we will need to remind\nthem, in due course.'\nThey stepped through a tall gateway flanked by Knights of the Body, their\nhelmets clasped under their arms but their faces kept so carefully blank they might as\nwell have had their visors down. A wide garden lay beyond, lined on all four sides\nby a shady colonnade, its white marble pillars carved in the likenesses of trees in\nleaf. Water splashed from fountains, sparkling in the bright sunlight. A pair of huge\norange birds with legs as thin as twigs strutted self-importantly about a perfectly\nclipped lawn. They stared haughtily at Jezal down their curved beaks as he passed\nthem, evidently in no more doubt than him that he was an utter impostor.\nHe gazed at the bright flowers, and the shimmering greenery, and the fine statues.\nHe stared up at the ancient walls, coated with red, white, and green creeper. Could it\nreally be that all this belonged to him? All this, and the whole Agriont besides? Was\nhe walking now in the mighty footsteps of the kings of old? Of Harod, and Casamir,\nand Arnault? It boggled the mind. Jezal had to blink and shake his head, as he had a\nhundred times already that day, simply to prevent himself from falling over. Was he\nnot the same man as he had been last week? He rubbed at his beard, as if to check,\nand felt the scar beneath it. The same man who had been soaked out on the wide\nplain, who had been wounded among the stones, who had eaten half-cooked\nhorsemeat and been glad to get it?\nJezal cleared his throat. 'I would like very much… I don't know whether it would\nbe possible… to speak to my father?'\n'Your father is dead.'\nJezal cursed silently to himself. 'Of course he is, I meant… the man I thought was\nmy father.'\n'What is it that you suppose he would tell you? That he made bad decisions?\nThat he had debts? That he took money from me in return for raising you?'\n'He took money?' muttered Jezal, feeling more forlorn than ever.\n'Families rarely take in orphans out of good will, even those with a winning\nmanner.

'Why, would\nyou prefer another?'\n'No. No, of course not.' He turned his head away and blinked back the tears. His\nold life had been a lie. His new one felt still more so. Even his own name was an\ninvention. They walked in silence through the gardens for a moment, their feet\ncrunching in the gravel, so fresh and perfect that Jezal wondered if every stone of it\nwas daily cleaned by hand.\n'Lord Isher will make many representations to your Majesty over the coming\nweeks and months.'\n'He will?' Jezal coughed, and sniffed, and put on his bravest face. 'Why?'\n'I promised him that his two brothers would be made Lords Chamberlain and\nChancellor on the Closed Council. That his family would be preferred above all\nothers. That was the price of his support in the vote.'\n'I see. Then I should honour the bargain?'\n'Absolutely not.'\nJezal frowned. 'I am not sure that I—'\n'Upon achieving power, one should immediately distance oneself from all allies.\nThey will feel they own your victory, and no rewards will ever satisfy them. You\nshould elevate your enemies instead. They will gush over small tokens, knowing they\ndo not deserve them.

Sooner or later he must be kicked back into his place. But not until you\nare safe in your position, and have plentiful support.'\n'I see,' Jezal puffed out his cheeks. Evidently there was more to being king than\nfine clothes, a haughty manner, and always getting the biggest chair.\n'This way.' Out of the garden and into a shadowy hallway panelled with black\nwood and lined with an array of antique arms to boggle the mind. Assorted suits of\nfull armour stood to glittering attention: plate and chain-mail, hauberk and cuirass, all\nstamped and emblazoned with the golden sun of the Union. Ceremonial greatswords\nas tall as a man, and halberds considerably taller, were bolted to the wall in an\nelaborate procession.

High above, the flags of forgotten regiments, gloriously slaughtered to a man in\nthe wars of long ago, hung tattered and lifeless from charred pikestaffs.\nA heavy double door loomed at the far end of this collection, black and\nunadorned, as inviting as a scaffold. Knights Herald stood on either side of it,\nsolemn as executioners, winged helmets glittering. Men taxed not only with guarding\nthe centre of government, but with carrying the King's Orders to whatever corner of\nthe Union was necessary. His orders, Jezal realised with a sudden further lurch of\nnerves.\n'His Majesty seeks audience with the Closed Council,' intoned Bayaz. The two\nmen reached out and pulled the heavy doors open. An angry voice surged out into\nthe corridor. 'There must be further concessions or there will only be further unrest!\nWe cannot simply—'\n'High Justice, I believe we have a visitor.'\nThe White Chamber was something of a disappointment after the magnificence of\nthe rest of the palace. It was not that large. There was no decoration on the plain\nwhite walls. The windows were narrow, almost cell-like, making the place seem\ngloomy even in the sunshine. There was no draft and the air was uncomfortably\nclose and stale. The only furniture was a long table of dark wood, piled high with\npapers, and six plain, hard chairs arranged down either side with another at the foot\nand one more, noticeably higher than the others, at the head. Jezal's own chair, he\nsupposed.\nThe Closed Council rose as he ducked reluctantly into the room. As frightening a\nselection of old men as could ever have been collected in one place, and every man\nof them staring right at Jezal in expectant silence. He jumped as the door was heaved\nshut behind him, the latch dropping with an unnerving finality.\n'Your Majesty,' and Lord Chamberlain Hoff bowed deep, 'may I and my\ncolleagues first congratulate you on your well-deserved elevation to the throne. We\nall feel that we have in you a worthy replacement for King Guslav, and look forward\nto advising you, and carrying out your orders, over the coming months and years.'\nHe bowed again, and the collection of formidable old men clapped their hands in\npolite applause.\n'Why, thank you all,' said Jezal, pleasantly surprised, however little he might feel\nlike a worthy replacement for anything. Perhaps this would not be so painful as he\nhad feared. The old wolves seemed tame enough to him.\n'Please allow me to make the introductions,' murmured Hoff. 'Arch Lector Sult,\nhead of your Inquisition.'\n'An honour to serve, your Majesty.'\n'High Justice Marovia, chief Law Lord.'\n'Likewise, your Majesty, an honour.'\n'With Lord Marshal Varuz, I believe you are already well acquainted.'\nThe old soldier beamed. 'It was a privilege to train you in the past, your Majesty,\nand will be a privilege to advise you now.'\nSo they went on, Jezal smiling and nodding to each man in turn. Halleck, the Lord"

Reutzer, Lord Admiral of the Fleet, and so\non, and so on. Finally Hoff ushered him to the high chair at the head of the table and\nJezal enthroned himself while the Closed Council smiled on. He grinned gormlessly\nup at them for a moment, and then realised. 'Oh, please be seated.'\nThe old men sat, a couple of them with evident winces of pain as old knees\ncrunched and old backs clicked. Bayaz dropped carelessly into the chair at the foot\nof the table, opposite Jezal, as though he had been occupying it all his life. Robes\nrustled as old arses shifted on polished wood, and gradually the room went silent as\na tomb. One chair was empty at Varuz' elbow. The chair where Lord Marshal Burr\nwould have sat, had he not been assigned to duty in the North. Had he not been\ndead. A dozen daunting old men waited politely for Jezal to speak. A dozen old men\nwho he had thought of until recently as occupying the pinnacle of power, all now\nanswerable to him. A situation he could never have imagined in his most\nself-indulgent daydreams. He cleared his throat.\n'Pray continue, my Lords. I will try and catch up as we go.'\nHoff flashed a humble smile. 'Of course, your Majesty. If at any time you require\nexplanation, you have but to ask.'\n'Thank you,' said Jezal, 'thank—'\nHalleck's grinding voice cut over him. 'Back to the issue of discipline among the\npeasantry, therefore.'\n'We have already prepared concessions!' snapped Sult. 'Concessions which the\npeasants were happy to accept.'\n'A shred of bandage to bind a suppurating wound!' returned Marovia. 'It is only a\nmatter of time before rebellion comes again. The only way we can avoid it is by\ngiving the common man what he needs. No more than is fair! We must involve him\nin the process of government.'\n'Involve him!' sneered Sult.\n'We must transfer the burden of tax to the landowners!'\nHalleck's eyes rolled to the ceiling. 'Not this nonsense again.'\n'Our current system has stood for centuries,' barked Sult.\n'It has failed for centuries!' threw back Marovia.\nJezal cleared his throat and the heads of the old men snapped round to look at\nhim. 'Could each man not simply be taxed the same proportion of his income,\nregardless of whether he is a peasant or a nobleman… and then, perhaps…' He\ntrailed off. It had seemed a simple enough idea to him, but now all eleven\nbureaucrats were staring at him, shocked, quite as if a domestic pet had been\nill-advisedly allowed into the room, and it had suddenly decided to speak up on the\nsubject of taxation. At the far end of the table, Bayaz silently examined his\nfingernails. There was no help there.\n'Ah, your Majesty,' ventured Torlichorm in soothing tones, 'such a system would"

There was no help there.\n'Ah, your Majesty,' ventured Torlichorm in soothing tones, 'such a system would\nbe almost impossible to administer.' And he blinked in a manner that said, 'How do\nyou manage to dress yourself, given your incredible ignorance?'\nJezal flushed to the lips of his ears. 'I see.'\n'The subject of taxation,' droned Halleck, 'is a stupendously complex one.' And\nhe gave Jezal a look that said, 'It is far too complex a subject to fit inside your tiny\nfragment of a mind.'\n'It would perhaps be better, your Majesty, if you were to leave the tedious details\nto your humble servants.' Marovia had an understanding smile that said, 'It would\nperhaps be better if you kept your mouth shut and avoided embarrassing the\ngrown-ups.'\n'Of course.' Jezal retreated shame-facedly into his chair. 'Of course.'\nAnd so it went on, as the morning ground by, as the strips of light from the\nwindows slunk slowly over the heaps of papers across the wide table. Gradually,\nJezal began to work out the rules of this game. Horribly complex, and yet horribly\nsimple. The aging players were split roughly into two teams. Arch Lector Sult and\nHigh Justice Marovia were the captains, fighting viciously over every subject, no\nmatter how small, each with three supporters who agreed with their every utterance.\nLord Hoff, meanwhile, ineffectually assisted by Lord Marshal Varuz, played the role\nof referee, and struggled to build bridges across the unbridgeable divide between\nthese two entrenched camps.\nJezal's mistake had not been to think that he would not know what to say, though\nof course, he did not. His mistake had been to think that anyone would want him to\nsay anything. All they cared about was continuing their own profitless struggles.\nThey had become used, perhaps, to conducting the affairs of state with a drooling\nhalfwit at the head of the table. Jezal now realised that they saw in him a like-for-like\ntrade. He began to wonder if they were right.\n'If your Majesty could sign here… and here… and here… and there…'\nThe pen scratched against paper after paper, the old voices droned on, and held\nforth, and bickered one with the other. The grey men smiled, and sighed, and shook\ntheir heads indulgently whenever he spoke, and so he spoke less and less. They\nbullied him with praise and blinded him with explanation. They bound him up in\nmeaningless hours of law, and form, and tradition. He sagged slowly lower and\nlower into his uncomfortable chair. A servant brought wine, and he drank, and\nbecame drunk, and bored, and even more drunk and bored. Minute by stretched-out\nminute, Jezal began to realise: there was nothing so indescribably dull, once you got\ndown to the nuts and bolts of it, as ultimate power.\n'Now to a sad matter,' observed Hoff, once the most recent argument had\nsputtered to a reluctant compromise.

'There are two clear\ncontenders for the post. Both are men of undoubted bravery and experience, whose\nmerits are well known to this council. I have no doubt that either General Poulder or\nGeneral Kroy would—'\n'There can be not the slightest doubt that Poulder is the better man!' snarled Sult,\nand Halleck immediately voiced his assent.\n'On the contrary!' hissed Marovia, to angry murmurs from his camp, 'Kroy is\ntransparently the better choice!'\nIt was an area in which, as an officer of some experience, Jezal felt he might have\nbeen of some minuscule value, but not one of the Closed Council seemed even to\nconsider seeking his opinion. He sagged back sulkily into his chair, and took another\nslurp of wine from his goblet while the old wolves continued to snap viciously at one\nanother.\n'Perhaps we should discuss this matter at greater length later!' cut in Lord Hoff\nover the increasingly acrimonious debate. 'His Majesty is growing fatigued with the\nfine points of the issue, and there is no particular urgency to the matter!' Sult and\nMarovia glared at each other, but did not speak. Hoff gave a sigh of relief. 'Very\nwell. Our next point of business relates to the supply of our army in Angland.\nColonel West writes in his dispatches—'\n'West?' Jezal sat up sharply, his voice rough with wine. The name was like\nsmelling salts to a fainting girl, a solid and dependable rock to cling to in the midst of\nall this chaos. If only West had been there now, to help him through, things would\nhave made so much more sense… he blinked at the chair that Burr had left behind\nhim, sitting empty at Varuz' shoulder. Jezal was drunk, perhaps, but he was king. He\ncleared his wet throat. 'Colonel West shall be my new Lord Marshal!'\nThere was a stunned silence. The twelve old men stared. Then Torlichorm\nchuckled indulgently, in a manner that said, 'How will we shut him up?'\n'Your Majesty, Colonel West is known to you personally, and a brave man, of\ncourse…'\nThe entire Council, it seemed, had finally found one issue on which they could all\nagree. 'First through the breach at Ulrioch and so on,' muttered Varuz, shaking his\nhead, 'but really—'\n'… he is junior, and inexperienced, and…'\n'He is a commoner,' said Hoff, eyebrows raised.\n'An unseemly break with tradition,' lamented Halleck.\n'Poulder would be far superior!' snarled Sult at Marovia.\n'Kroy is the man!' Marovia barked back."

The old man gave a wail of shock\nand pain and slid from his chair, blood running from a long gash across his face.\n'Cannot?' screamed Jezal, on his feet, eyes starting from his head. 'You dare to\ngive me fucking \"cannot\", you old bastard? You belong to me, all of you!' His finger\nstabbed furiously at the air. 'You exist to advise me, not to dictate to me! I rule here!\nMe!' He snatched up the ink bottle and hurled it across the room. It burst apart\nagainst the wall, spraying a great black stain across the plaster and spattering the arm\nof Arch Lector Sult's perfect white coat with black spots. 'Me! Me! The tradition we\nneed here is one of fucking obedience!' He grabbed a sheaf of documents and flung\nthem at Marovia, filling the air with fluttering paper. 'Never again give me \"cannot!\"\nNever!'\nEleven sets of dumbstruck eyes stared at Jezal. One set smiled, down at the very\nend of the table. That made him angrier than ever. 'Collem West shall be my new\nLord Marshal!' he screeched, and kicked his chair over in a fury. 'At our next\nmeeting I will be treated with the proper respect, or I'll have the pack of you in\nchains! In fucking chains… and… and…' His head was hurting, now, rather badly.\nHe had thrown everything within easy reach, and was becoming desperately unsure\nof how to proceed.\nBayaz rose sternly from his chair. 'My Lords, that will be all for today.'\nThe Closed Council needed no further encouragement. Papers flapped, robes\nrustled, chairs squealed as they scrambled to be first out of the room. Hoff made it\ninto the corridor. Marovia followed close behind and Sult swept after him. Varuz\nhelped Torlichorm up from the floor and guided him by his elbow. 'I apologise,' he\nwas wheezing as he was hustled, bloody-faced, through the door, 'your Majesty, I\napologise profusely…'\nBayaz stood sternly at the end of the table, watching the councillors hurry from\nthe room. Jezal lurked opposite, frozen somewhere between further anger and mortal\nembarrassment, but increasingly tending towards the latter. It seemed to take an age\nfor the last member of the Closed Council to finally escape from the room, and for\nthe great black doors to be dragged shut.\nThe First of the Magi turned towards Jezal, and a broad smile broke suddenly out\nacross his face.

Jezal had been sure that he had made an ass of himself to a degree from\nwhich he could never recover.\n'Your advisers will think twice before taking you lightly again, I think. Not a new\nstrategy, but no less effective for that. Harod the Great was himself possessed of a\nfearsome temper, and made excellent use of it. After one of his tantrums no one\nwould dare to question his decisions for weeks.' Bayaz chuckled. 'Though I suspect\nthat even Harod would have balked at dealing a wound to his own High Consul.'\n'That was no tantrum!' snarled Jezal, his temper flickering up again. If he was\nbeset by horrible old men, then Bayaz was himself the worst culprit by far. 'If I am a\nking I will be treated like one! I refuse to be dictated to in my own palace! Not by\nanyone… not by… I mean…'\nBayaz glared back at him, his green eyes frighteningly hard, and spoke with frosty\ncalm. 'If your intention is to lose your temper with me, your Majesty, I would\nstrongly advise against it.'\nJezal's rage had been on the very verge of fading already, and now, under the icy\ngaze of the Magus, it wilted away entirely. 'Of course… I'm sorry… I'm very sorry.'\nHe closed his eyes and stared numbly down at the polished tabletop. He never used\nto say sorry for anything. Now that he was a king, and needed to apologise to no\nman, he found he could not stop. 'I did not ask for this,' he muttered weakly,\nflopping down in his chair. 'I don't know how it happened. I did nothing to deserve\nit.'\n'Of course not.' Bayaz came slowly around the table. 'No man can ever deserve\nthe throne. That is why you must strive to be worthy of it now. Every day. Just as\nyour great predecessors did. Casamir. Arnault, Harod himself.'\nJezal took a long breath, and blew it out. 'You're right, of course. How can you\nalways be right?'\nBayaz held up a humble hand. 'Always right? Scarcely. But I have the benefit of\nlong experience, and am here to guide you as best I can. You have made a fine start\nalong a difficult road, and you should be proud, as I am. There are certain steps we\ncannot delay, however. Chief among them is your wedding.'\nJezal gaped. 'Wedding?'\n'An unmarried king is like a chair with three legs, your Majesty. Apt to fall. Your\nrump has only just touched the throne, and it is far from settled there. You need a\nwife who brings you support, and you need heirs so that your subjects may feel\nsecure. All that delay will bring is opportunities for your enemies to work against\nyou.'\nThe blows fell so rapidly that Jezal had to grasp his head, hoping to stop it flying\napart. 'My enemies?' Had he not always tried to get on with everyone?\n'Can you be so naive? Lord Brock is doubtless already plotting against you. Lord\nIsher will not be put off indefinitely. Others on the Open Council supported you out\nof fear, or were paid to do so.'\n'Paid?' gasped Jezal."

You must marry, and your wife must bring\nyou powerful allies.'\n'But I have…' Jezal licked his lips, uncertain of how to broach the subject. 'Some\ncommitments… in that line.'\n'Ardee West?' Jezal half opened his mouth to ask Bayaz how he knew so much\nabout his romantic entanglements, but quickly thought better of it. The old man\nseemed to know far more about him than he did himself, after all. 'I know how it is,\nJezal. I have lived a long life. Of course you love her. Of course you would give up\nanything for her, now. But that feeling, trust me, will not last.'\nJezal shifted his weight uncomfortably. He tried to picture Ardee's uneven smile,\nthe softness of her hair, the sound of her laugh. The way that had given him such\ncomfort, out on the plain. But it was hard to think of her now without remembering\nher teeth sinking into his lip, his face tingling from her slap, the sound of the table\ncreaking back and forward underneath them. The shame, and the guilt, and the\ncomplexity. Bayaz' voice continued: mercilessly calm, brutally realistic, ruthlessly\nreasonable.\n'It is only natural that you made commitments, but your past life is gone, and\nyour commitments have gone with it. You are a king, now, and your people demand\nthat you behave like one. They need something to look up to. Something effortlessly\nhigher than themselves. We are talking of the High Queen of the Union. A mother to\nkings. A farmer's daughter with a tendency towards unpredictable behaviour and a\npenchant for heavy drinking? I think not.' Jezal flinched to hear Ardee described that\nway, but he could hardly argue the point.\n'You are a natural son. A wife of unimpeachable breeding would lend your line far\ngreater weight. Far greater respect. There is a world full of eligible women, your\nMajesty, all born to high station. Dukes' daughters, and kings' sisters, beautiful and\ncultured. A world of princesses to choose from.'\nJezal felt his eyebrows rising. He loved Ardee, of course, but Bayaz made a\ndevastating argument. There was so much more to think of now than his own needs,\nif the idea of himself as a king was absurd, the idea of Ardee as a queen was triply\nso. He loved her, of course. In a way. But a world of princesses to choose from?\nThat was a phrase it was decidedly hard to find fault with.\n'You see it!' The First of the Magi snapped his fingers in triumph. 'I will send to\nDuke Orso of Talins, that his daughter Terez should be introduced to you.' He held\nup a calming hand. 'Just to begin with, you understand. Talins would make a\npowerful ally.' He smiled, and leaned forward to murmur in Jezal's ear. 'But you need\nnot leave everything behind, if you truly are attached to this girl. Kings often keep\nmistresses, you know.'\nAnd that, of course, decided the matter."

I could be gone on\nthe next tide, and no one any worse off. Perhaps a tour of the beautiful cities of\nStyria? A cruise round the Thousand Isles?

Caring no more for innocence\nor guilt, for truth or for lies, than do these little lumps of rock.\nThe gems twinkled in the candlelight, clicking against each other, tickling at his\nfingers as he pushed them through one way, and back the other. But his Eminence\nwould weep and weep at my sudden disappearance. So, one imagines, would the\nbanking house of Valint and Balk. Where in all the wide Circle of the World\nwould I be safe from the tears of such powerful masters? And why? So I can sit on\nmy crippled arse all the long day, waiting for the killers to come? So I can lie in\nbed, and ache, and think about all that I've lost?\nHe frowned down at the jewels: clean, and hard, and beautiful. I made my choices\nlong ago. When I took Valint and Balk's money. When I kissed the ring of office.\nBefore the Emperor's prisons, even, when I rode down to the bridge, sure that only\nmagnificent Sand dan Glokta could save the world…\nA thumping knock echoed through the room and Glokta jerked his head up,\ntoothless mouth hanging open.

Priceless, glittering handfuls of them. Sweat had\nbroken out across his forehead.\nWhat if the Arch Lector were to discover my little treasure trove? He giggled to\nhimself as he snatched at the leather case. I was going to mention all this, really I\nwas, but the timing never seemed quite right. A small matter, after all—no more\nthan a king's ransom.

'Your Eminence, Bayaz is ensconced in the palace, and well\nbeyond my reach… his protégé is now our King…' Thanks in part to our own\ndesperate efforts. Glokta almost winced, but he could not stop himself from asking\nthe question. 'How am I to do it?'\n'How?' shrieked Sult, 'how, you crippled worm?' He swept his hand furiously\nacross the board and dashed the pieces spinning across the floor. And I wonder\nwho will have to bend down to pick those up? The six Practicals, as though\ncontrolled by the pitch of the Arch Lector's voice, detached themselves from the\nwalls and loomed menacingly into the room. 'If I wished to attend to every detail\nmyself I would have no need of your worthless services! Get out there and get it\ndone, you twisted slime!'\n'Your Eminence is too kind,' muttered Glokta, humbly inclining his head once"

Get out there and get it\ndone, you twisted slime!'\n'Your Eminence is too kind,' muttered Glokta, humbly inclining his head once\nmore. But even the lowest dog needs a scratch behind the ears, from time to time,\nor he might go for his master's throat…\n'And look into his story while you're about it.'\n'Story, Arch Lector?'\n'This fairytale of Carmee dan Roth!' Sult's eyes went narrower still, hard creases\ncutting into the bridge of his nose. 'If we cannot take the leash ourselves, we must\nhave the dog put down, do you understand?'\nGlokta felt his eye twitching, in spite of his efforts to make it be still. We find a\nway to bring King Jezal's reign to an abrupt end. Dangerous. If the Union is a\nship, it has but lately come through a storm, and is listing badly. We have lost one\ncaptain. Replace another now, and the boat might break apart entirely. We will\nall be swimming in some deep, cold, unknown waters then. Civil War, anyone? He\nfrowned down at the squares pieces scattered across his floor. But his Eminence\nhas spoken. What is it that Shickel said? When your master gives you a task, you\ndo your best at it. Even if the task is a dark one. And some of us are only suited to\ndark tasks…\n'Carmee dan Roth, and her bastard. I shall find the truth of it, your Eminence,\nyou can depend on me.'\nSult's sneer curled to even greater heights of contempt. 'If only!'\nThe House of Questions was busy, for an evening. Glokta saw no one as he limped\ndown the corridor, his excuses for teeth pressed into his lip, his hand clenched tight\naround the handle of his cane, slippery with sweat. He saw no one, but he heard\nthem.\nVoices bubbled from behind the iron-bound doors. Low and insistent. Asking\nthe questions. High and desperate. Spilling the answers. From time to time a shriek,\nor a roar, or a howl of pain would cut through the heavy silence. Those hardly need\nexplaining. Severard was leaning against the dirty wall as Glokta limped towards\nhim, one foot up on the plaster, whistling tunelessly behind his mask.\n'What's all this?' asked Glokta.\n'Some of Lord Brock's people got drunk, then they got noisy. Fifty of 'em, made\nquite a mess up near the Four Corners. Moaning about rights, whining on how the\npeople were cheated, mouthing off how Brock should've been king. They say it was\na demonstration. We say it was treason.'\n'Treason, eh?' The definition is notoriously flexible. 'Pick out some ringleaders\nand get some paper signed. Angland is back in Union hands. High time we started\nfilling the place up with traitors.'\n'They're already at it. Anything else?'\n'Oh, of course.' Juggling knives. One comes down, two go up. Always more\nblades spinning in the air, and each one with a deadly edge. 'I had a visit from his\nEminence earlier today. A brief visit, but too long for my taste.'\n'Work for us?'"

I'm what you call an optimist.'\n'Lucky for you.' I rather tend the other way. Glokta took a deep breath and let it\nout in a long sigh. 'The First of the Magi and his bold companions.'\n'Again?'\n'His Eminence wants information.'\n'This Bayaz, though. Isn't he tight with our new king?'\nGlokta raised an eyebrow as a muffled roar of pain echoed down the corridor.\nTight? He might as well have made him out of clay. 'That is why we must keep our\neyes upon him, Practical Severard. For his own protection. Powerful men have\npowerful enemies, as well as powerful friends.'\n'Think that Navigator knows anything else?'\n'Nothing that will do the trick.'\n'Shame. I was getting used to having the little bastard around. He tells a hell of a\nstory about a huge fish.'\nGlokta sucked at his empty gums. 'Keep him where he is for now. Perhaps\nPractical Frost will appreciate his tall tales.' He has a fine sense of humour.\n'If the Navigator's no use, who do we squeeze?'\nWho indeed? Ninefingers is gone. Bayaz himself is tucked up tight in the\npalace, and his apprentice hardly leaves his side. The erstwhile Jezal dan Luthar,\nwe must concede, is now far beyond our reach… 'What about that woman?'\nSeverard looked up. 'What, that brown bitch?'\n'She's still in the city, isn't she?'\n'Last I heard.'\n'Follow her, then, and find out what she's about.'\nThe Practical paused. 'Do I have to?'\n'What? You scared?'\nSeverard lifted up his mask and scratched underneath it. 'I can think of people I'd\nrather follow.'\n'Life is a series of things we would rather not do.' Glokta looked up and down\nthe corridor, making sure there was no one there. 'We also need to ask some\nquestions about Carmee dan Roth, supposed mother of our present king.'\n'What sort of questions?'\nHe leaned towards Severard and hissed quietly in his ear. 'Questions like—did\nshe really bear a child before she died? Was that child really the issue of the\noveractive loins of King Guslav? Is that child truly the same man that we now have\non the throne? You know the kind of questions.' Questions that could land us in a\ngreat deal of trouble. Questions that some people might call treason. After all, the\ndefinition is notoriously flexible.\nSeverard's mask looked the same as ever, but the rest of his face was decidedly\nworried. 'You sure we want to go digging there?'\n'Why don't you ask the Arch Lector if he's sure? He sounded sure to me. Get\nFrost to help you if you're having trouble.'\n'But… what are we looking for?

'If I wished to attend to every detail myself I would have\nno need of your services. Get out there and get it done!'\nWhen Glokta had been young and beautiful, quick and promising, admired and\nenvied, he had spent a great deal of time in the taverns of Adua. Though I never\nremember falling this far, even in my darkest moods.\nHe scarcely felt out of place now, as he hobbled among the customers. To be\ncrippled was the norm here, and he had more teeth than average. Nearly everyone\ncarried unsightly scars or debilitating injuries, sores or warts to make a toad blush.\nThere were men with faces rough as the skin on a bowl of old porridge. Men who\nshook worse than leaves in a gale and stank of week-old piss. Men who looked as if\nthey'd slit a child's throat just to keep their knives sharp. A drunken whore slouched\nagainst a post in an attitude that could hardly have been arousing to the most\ndesperate sailor. That same reek of sour beer and hopelessness, sour sweat and\nearly death that I remember from the sites of my worst excesses. Only stronger.\nThere were some private booths at one end of the stinking common room,\nvaulted archways full of miserable shadows and even more miserable drunks. And\nwho might one expect to find in such surroundings? Glokta shuffled to a stop\nbeside the last of them.\n'Well, well, well. I never thought I'd see you alive again.'\nNicomo Cosca looked even worse than when Glokta first met him, if that was\npossible. He was spread out against the slimy wall, his hands dangling, his head\nhanging over to one side, his eyes scarcely open as he watched Glokta work his\npainful way into a chair opposite. His skin was soapy pale in the flickering light from\nthe single mean candle flame, dark pouches under his eyes, dark shadows shifting\nover his pinched and pointed face. The rash on his neck had grown angrier, and\nspread up the side of his jaw like ivy up a ruin. With just a little more effort he might\nlook nearly as ill as me.\n'Superior Glokta,' he wheezed, in a voice as rough as tree-bark, 'I am delighted\nthat you received my message. What an honour to renew our acquaintance, against\nall the odds. Your masters did not reward your efforts in the South with a cut throat,\neh?'\n'I was as surprised as you are, but no.' Though there is still ample time. 'How\nwas Dagoska after I left?'\nThe Styrian puffed out his hollow cheeks. 'Dagoska was a real mess, since you\nare asking. A lot of men dead. A lot of men made slaves. That's what happens when\nthe Gurkish come to dinner, eh? Good men with bad endings, and the bad men did\nlittle better. Bad endings for everyone. Your friend General Vissbruck got one of\nthem.'\n'I understand he cut his own throat.' To rapturous approval from the public.\n'How did you get away?'\nThe corner of Cosca's mouth curled up, as though he would have liked to smile"

To rapturous approval from the public.\n'How did you get away?'\nThe corner of Cosca's mouth curled up, as though he would have liked to smile\nbut had not the energy. 'I disguised myself as a servant girl, and I fucked my way\nout.'\n'Ingenious.' But far more likely you were the one who opened the gates to the\nGurkish, in return for your freedom. I wonder if I would have done the same, in\nthat position? Probably. 'And lucky for us both.'\n'They say that luck is a woman. She's drawn to those that least deserve her.'\n'Perhaps so.' Though I appear to be both undeserving and unlucky. 'It is\ncertainly fortunate that you should appear in Adua at this moment. Things are…\nunsettled.'\nGlokta heard a squeaking, rustling sound and a large rat dashed out from under\nhis chair and paused for a moment in full view. Cosca delved a clumsy hand into his\nstained jacket and whipped it out. A throwing knife flew out with it, flashed through\nthe air. It shuddered into the boards a good stride or two wide of the mark. The rat\nsat there for a moment longer, as though to communicate its contempt, then scurried\naway between the table and chair legs, the scuffed boots of the patrons.\nCosca sucked at his stained teeth as he slithered from the booth to retrieve his\nblade. 'I used to be dazzling with a throwing knife, you know.'\n'Beautiful women used to hang from my every word.' Glokta sucked at his own\nempty gums. 'Times change.'\n'So I hear. All kinds of changes. New rulers mean new worries. Worries mean\nbusiness, for people in my trade.'\n'It might be that I will have a use for your particular talents, before too long.'\n'I cannot say that I would turn you down.' Cosca tipped his bottle up and stuck\nhis tongue into the neck, licking out the last trickle. 'My purse is empty as a dry well.\nSo empty, in fact, that I don't even have a purse.'\nThere, at least, I am able to assist. Glokta checked that they were not observed,\nthen tossed something across the rough table top and watched it bounce with a click\nand a spin to a halt in front of Cosca. The mercenary picked it up between finger\nand thumb, held it to the candle flame and stared at it through one bloodshot eye.\n'This seems to be a diamond.'\n'Consider yourself on retainer. I daresay you could find some like-minded men to\nassist you. Some reliable men, who tell no tales and ask no questions. Some good\nmen, to help out.'\n'Some bad men, do you mean?'\nGlokta grinned, displaying the gaps in his teeth. 'Well. I suppose that all depends\non whether you're the employer, or you're the job.'\n'I suppose it does at that.' Cosca let his empty bottle drop to the ill-formed\nfloorboards. 'And what is the job, Superior?'\n'For now, just to wait, and stay out of sight.' He leaned from the booth with a\nwince and snapped his fingers at a surly serving girl. 'Another bottle of what my\nfriend is drinking!'\n'And later?'"

Those bastards don't play by the rules.\nGod, and righteousness, and belief.' He shuddered. 'Makes me nervous.'\n'Well, whoever it is banging on the door, I'm sure I can organise a heroic last\nstand, against the odds, without hope of relief.' I am not lacking for enemies, after\nall.\nThe mercenary's eyes glinted as the girl thumped a full bottle down on the warped\ntable before him. 'Ah, lost causes. My favourite.'\nThe Habit of Command\n« ^ »\nWest sat in the Lord Marshal's tent and stared hopelessly into space. For the past\nyear he had scarcely had an idle moment. Now, suddenly, there was nothing for him\nto do but wait. He kept expecting to see Burr push through the flap and walk to the\nmaps, his fists clenched behind him. He kept expecting to feel his reassuring\npresence around the camp, to hear his booming voice call the wayward officers to\norder. But of course he would not. Not now and not ever again.\nOn the left sat General Kroy's staff, solemn and sinister in their black uniforms,\nas rigidly pressed as ever. On the right lounged Poulder's men, top buttons\ncarelessly undone in an open affront to their opposite numbers, as puffed-up as\npeacocks displaying their tail feathers. The two great Generals themselves eyed each\nother with all the suspicion of rival armies across a battlefield, awaiting the edict that\nwould raise one of them to the Closed Council and the heights of power, and dash\nthe other's hopes for ever. The edict that would name the new King of the Union,\nand his new Lord Marshal.\nIt was to be Poulder or Kroy, of course, and both anticipated their final, glorious\nvictory over the other. In the meantime the army, and West in particular, sat\nparalysed. Powerless. Far to the north the Dogman and his companions, who had\nsaved West's life in the wilderness more times than he could remember, were no\ndoubt fighting for survival, watching desperately for help that would never come.\nFor West, the entire business was very much like being at his own funeral, and\none attended chiefly by sneering, grinning, posturing enemies. It was to be Poulder\nor Kroy, and whichever one it was, he was doomed. Poulder hated him with a\nflaming passion, Kroy with an icy scorn. The only fall swifter and more complete\nthan his own would be that of Poulder, or of Kroy, whichever of them was finally\noverlooked by the Closed Council.\nThere was a dim commotion outside, and heads turned keenly to look. There was\na scuffle of feet up to the tent, and several officers rose anxiously from their chairs.\nThe flap was torn aside and the Knight Herald finally burst jingling through it.

He was\nimmensely tall, the wings on his helmet almost poking a hole in the tent's ceiling as he\nstraightened up. He had a leather case over one armoured shoulder, stamped with the\ngolden sun of the Union. West stared at it, holding his breath.\n'Present your message,' urged Kroy, holding out his hand.\n'Present it to me!' snapped Poulder.\nThe two men jostled each other with scant dignity while the Knight Herald\nfrowned down at them, impassive. 'Is Colonel West in attendance?' he demanded, in\na booming bass. Every eye, and most especially those of Poulder and Kroy,\nswivelled round.\nWest found himself rising hesitantly from his chair. 'Er… I am West.'\nThe Knight Herald stepped carelessly around General Kroy and advanced on\nWest, spurs rattling. He opened his dispatch case, pulled out a roll of parchment and\nheld it up. 'On the king's orders.'\nThe final irony of West's unpredictable career, it seemed, was that he would be\nthe one to announce the name of the man who would dismiss him in dishonour\nmoments later. But if he was to fall on his sword, delay would only increase the pain.\nHe took the scroll from the Knight's gauntleted hand and broke the heavy seal. He\nunrolled it halfway, a block of flowing script coming into view. The room held its\nbreath as he began to read.\nWest gave vent to a disbelieving giggle. Even with the tent as tense as a\ncourtroom waiting for judgement, he could not help himself. He had to go over the\nfirst section twice more before he came close to taking it in.\n'What is amusing?' demanded Kroy.\n'The Open Council has elected Jezal dan Luthar as the new King of the Union,\nhenceforth known as Jezal the First.' West had to stifle more laughter even though, if\nit was a joke, it was not a funny one.\n'Luthar?' someone asked. 'Who the hell is Luthar?'\n'That boy who won the Contest?'\nIt was all, somehow, awfully appropriate. Jezal had always behaved as though he\nwas better than everyone else. Now, it seemed, he was. But all of that, momentous\nthough it might have been, was a side-issue here.\n'Who is the new Lord Marshal?' growled Kroy, and the two staffs shuffled\nforward, all on their feet now, forming a half-circle of expectation.\nWest took a deep breath, gathered himself like a child preparing to plunge into an\nicy pool. He pulled the scroll open and his eyes scanned quickly over the lower\nblock of writing. He frowned. Neither Poulder's name nor Kroy's appeared\nanywhere. He read it again, more carefully. His knees felt suddenly very weak.\n'Who does it name?' Poulder nearly shrieked. West opened his mouth, but he\ncould not find the words. He held the letter out, and Poulder snatched it from his\nhand while Kroy struggled unsuccessfully to look over his shoulder.\n'No,' breathed Poulder, evidently having reached the end.\nKroy wrestled the dispatch away and his eyes flickered over it. 'This must be a\nmistake!'"

'This must be a\nmistake!'\nBut the Knight Herald did not think so. 'The Closed Council are not in the habit\nof making mistakes. You have the King's orders!' He turned to West and bowed.\n'My Lord Marshal, I bid you farewell.'\nThe army's best and brightest all gawped at West, jaws dangling. 'Er… yes,' he\nmanaged to stammer. 'Yes, of course.'\nAn hour later, the tent was empty. West sat alone at Burr's writing desk, nervously\narranging and rearranging the pen, ink, paper, and most of all the large letter he had\njust sealed with a blob of red wax. He frowned down at it, and up at the maps on the\nboards, and back down at his hands sitting idle on the scarred leather, and he tried to\nunderstand what the hell had happened.\nAs far as he could tell, he had been suddenly elevated to one of the highest\npositions in the Union. Lord Marshal West. With the possible exception of Bethod\nhimself, he was the most powerful man on this side of the Circle Sea. Poulder and\nKroy would be obliged to call him 'sir'. He had a chair on the Closed Council. Him!\nCollem West! A commoner, who had been scorned, and bullied, and patronised his\nentire life. How could it possibly have happened? Not through merit, certainly. Not\nthrough any action or inaction on his part. Through pure chance. A chance\nfriendship with a man who, in many ways, he did not particularly like, and had\ncertainly never expected to do him any favours. A man who, in a stroke of fortune\nthat could only be described as a miracle, had now ascended to the throne of the\nUnion.\nHis disbelieving laughter was short-lived. A most unpleasant image was forming\nin his head. Prince Ladisla, lying somewhere in the wilderness with his head broken\nopen, half-naked and unburied. West swallowed. If it had not been for him, Ladisla\nwould now be king, and he would be swabbing latrines instead of preparing to take\ncommand of the army. His head was starting to hurt and he rubbed uncomfortably at\nhis temples. Perhaps he had played a crucial part in his own advancement after all.\nThe tent flap rustled as Pike came through with his burned-out ruin of a grin.\n'General Kroy is here.'\n'Let him sweat a moment.' But it was West who was sweating. He wiped his\nmoist palms together and tugged the jacket of his uniform smooth, his Colonel's\ninsignia but recently cut from the shoulders. He had to appear to be in complete and\neffortless control, just as Marshal Burr had always done. Just as Marshal Varuz had\nused to, out in the dry wastelands of Gurkhul. He had to squash Poulder and Kroy\nwhile he had the chance. If he did not do it now, he would be forever at their mercy.\nA piece of meat, torn between two furious dogs. He reluctantly picked up the letter\nand held it out to Pike.\n'Could we not just hang the pair of them, sir?' asked the convict as he took it."

But we cannot do without them, however troublesome they may be. A\nnew King, a new Lord Marshal, both men that, by and large, no one has ever heard\nof. The soldiers need leaders they know.' He took a long breath through his nose,\npuffing out his chest. Each man had to do his part, and that was all. He let it hiss out.\n'Show in General Kroy, please.'\n'Yes, sir.' Pike held the tent flap open and roared out, 'General Kroy!'\nKroy's black uniform, chased about the collar with embroidered golden leaves,\nwas so heavily starched that it was a surprise he could move at all. He drew himself\nup and stood to vibrating attention, eyes fixed on the middle distance. His salute was\nimpeccable, every part of his body in regulation position, and yet he somehow\nmanaged to make his contempt and disappointment plain to see.\n'May I first offer my congratulations,' he grated, 'Lord Marshal.'\n'Thank you, General. Graciously said. '\n'A considerable promotion, for one so young, so inexperienced—'\n'I have been a professional soldier some dozen years, and fought in two wars and\nseveral battles. It would seem his Majesty the King deems me sufficiently seasoned.'\nKroy cleared his throat. 'Of course, Lord Marshal. But you are new to high\ncommand. In my opinion you would be wise to seek the assistance of a more\nexperienced man.'\n'I agree with you absolutely.'\nKroy lifted one eyebrow a fraction. 'I am glad to hear that.'\n'That man should, without the slightest doubt, be General Poulder.' To give him\ncredit, Kroy's face did not move. A small squeak issued from his nose. The only\nindication of what, West did not doubt, was his boundless dismay. He had been hurt\nwhen he arrived. Now he was reeling. The very best time to plunge the blade in to the\nhilt. 'I have always been a great admirer of General Poulder's approach to soldiering.\nHis dash. His vigour. He is, to my mind, the very definition of what an officer should\nbe.'\n'Quite so,' hissed Kroy through gritted teeth.\n'I am taking his advice in a number of areas. There is only one major issue upon\nwhich we differed.'\n'Indeed?'\n'You, General Kroy.' Kroy's face had assumed the colour of a plucked chicken,\nthe trace of scorn replaced quick-time by a definite tinge of horror. 'Poulder was of\nthe opinion that you should be dismissed immediately. I was for giving you one\nmore chance. Sergeant Pike?'\n'Sir.' The ex-convict stepped forward smartly and held out the letter. West took it\nfrom him and displayed it to the General.\n'This is a letter to the king. I begin by reminding him of the happy years we\nserved together in Adua.

Your\ntendency to steal the credit. Your bloodless inflexibility. Your insubordinate\nreluctance to work with other officers.' If it was possible for Kroy's face to grow yet\nmore drawn and pale it did so, steadily, as he stared at the folded paper. 'I earnestly\nhope that I will never have to send it. But I will, at the slightest provocation to myself\nor to General Poulder, am I understood?'\nKroy appeared to grope for words. 'Perfectly understood,' he croaked in the end,\n'my Lord Marshal.'\n'Excellent. We are extremely tardy in setting off for our rendezvous with our\nNorthern allies and I hate to arrive late to a meeting. You will transfer your cavalry to\nmy command, for now. I will be taking them north with General Poulder, in pursuit\nof Bethod.'\n'And I, sir?'\n'A few Northmen still remain on the hills above us. It will be your task to sweep\nthem away and clear the road to Carleon, giving our enemies the impression that our\nmain body has not moved north. Succeed in that and I may be willing to trust you\nwith more. You will make the arrangements before first light.' Kroy opened his\nmouth, as though about to complain at the impossibility of the request. 'You have\nsomething to add?'\nThe General quickly thought better of it. 'No, sir. Before first light, of course.' He\neven managed to force his face into a shape vaguely resembling a smile.\nWest did not have to try too hard to smile back. 'I am glad you are embracing\nthis chance to redeem yourself, General. You are dismissed.' Kroy snapped to\nattention once more, spun on his heel, caught his leg up with his sabre and stumbled\nfrom the tent in some disarray.\nWest took a long breath. His head was pounding. He wanted nothing more than\nto lie down for a few moments, but there was no time. He tugged the jacket of his\nuniform smooth again. If he had survived that nightmare journey north through the\nsnow, he could survive this. 'Send in General Poulder.'\nPoulder swaggered into the tent as though he owned the place and stood to\nslapdash attention, his salute as flamboyant as Kroy's had been rigid. 'Lord Marshal\nWest, I would like to extend to you my earnest congratulations on your unexpected\nadvancement.' He grinned unconvincingly, but West did not join him. He sat there,\nfrowning up at Poulder as if he was a problem that he was considering a harsh\nsolution to. He sat there for some time, saying nothing. The General's eyes began to\ndart nervously around the tent. He gave an apologetic cough. 'Might I ask, Lord\nMarshal, what you had to discuss with General Kroy?'\n'Why, all manner of things.' West kept his face stony hard. 'My respect for\nGeneral Kroy on all matters military is boundless. We are much alike, he and I. His\nprecision. His attention to detail. He is, to my mind, the very definition of what a\nsoldier should be.'\n'He is a most accomplished officer,' Poulder managed to hiss."

I have been elevated with great rapidity to my position, and I feel I need a\nsenior man, a man with a wealth of experience, to act as a… as a mentor, if you will,\nnow that Marshal Burr is gone. General Kroy has been good enough to agree to\nserve in that capacity.'\n'Has he indeed?' A sheen of sweat was forming across Poulder's forehead.\n'He has made a number of excellent suggestions which I am already putting into\npractice. There was only one issue on which we could not agree.' He steepled his\nfingers on the desk before him and looked sternly at Poulder over the top of them.\n'You were that issue, General Poulder. You.'\n'I, Lord Marshal?'\n'Kroy pressed for your immediate dismissal.' Poulder's fleshy face was rapidly\nturning pink. 'But I have decided to extend to you one final opportunity.'\nWest picked up the very same paper that he had displayed to Kroy. 'This is a\nletter to the king. I begin by thanking him for my promotion, by enquiring after his\nhealth, by reminding him of our close personal friendship. I go on to lay out in detail\nthe reasons for your immediate cashiering in disgrace. Your unbecoming arrogance,\nGeneral Poulder. Your tendency to steal the credit. Your reluctance to obey orders.\nYour stubborn inability to work with other officers. I earnestly hope that I will never\nhave to send it. But I will, at the slightest provocation. The slightest provocation to\nmyself or to General Kroy, am I understood?'\nPoulder swallowed, sweat glistening all over his ruddy face. 'You are, my Lord\nMarshal.'\n'Good. I am trusting General Kroy to seize control of the hills between us and\nCarleon. Until you prove yourself worthy of a separate command you will stay with\nme. I want your division ready to move north before first light, and the swiftest units\nto the fore. Our Northern allies are relying on us, and I do not mean to let them\ndown. At first light, General, and with the greatest speed.'\n'The greatest speed, of course. You can rely on me… sir.'\n'I hope so, in spite of my reservations. Every man must do his part, General\nPoulder. Every man.'\nPoulder blinked and worked his mouth, half turned to leave, remembered\nbelatedly to salute, then strode from the tent. West watched the flap moving ever so\ngently in the wind outside, then he sighed, crumpled the letter up in his hand and\ntossed it away into the corner. It was nothing but a blank sheet of paper, after all.\nPike raised one pink, mostly hairless brow. 'Sweetly done, sir, if I may say. Even\nin the camps, I never saw better lying.'\n'Thank you, Sergeant. Now that I begin, I find I warm to the work. My father\nalways warned me against untruths, but between you and me the man was a shit, a\ncoward, and a failure. If he was here now I'd spit in his face.'"

If he was here now I'd spit in his face.'\nWest rose and walked to the largest-scale of the maps, stood before it, his hands\nclasped behind his back. In just the way that Marshal Burr would have done, he\nrealised. He examined the dirty finger-smudge in the mountains where\nCrummock-i-Phail had indicated the position of his fortress. He traced the route to\nthe Union army's own current position, far to the south, and frowned. It was hard to\nbelieve that a Union cartographer could ever have come close to surveying that\nterrain in person, and the flamboyant shapes of the hills and rivers had an undoubted\nflavour of make-believe about them.\n'How long do you think it will take to get there, sir?' asked Pike.\n'Impossible to say.' Even if they got started immediately, which was unlikely.\nEven if Poulder did as he was told, which was doubly so. Even if the map was\nhalfway accurate, which he knew it was not. He shook his head grimly. 'Impossible\nto say.'\nThe First Day\n« ^ »\nThe eastern sky was just catching fire. Long strips of pink cloud and long strips of\nblack cloud were stretched out across the pale blue, the hazy grey shapes of\nmountains notched and jagged as a butcher's knife underneath. The western sky was\na mass of dark iron still—cold and comfortless.\n'Nice day for it,' said Crummock.\n'Aye.' But Logen wasn't sure there was any such a thing.\n'Well, if Bethod don't show, and we get nothing killed at all, at least you lot will\nhave done wonders for my wall, eh?'\nIt was amazing how well and how fast a man could patch a wall when it was the\npile of stones that might save his own life. A few short days and they had the whole\nstretch of it built up and mortared, most of the ivy cut away. From inside the fort,\nwhere the ground was that much higher, it didn't look too fearsome. From outside it\nwas three times the height of a tall man up to the walkway. They'd new made the\nparapet neck-high at the top, with plenty of good slots for shooting and throwing\nrocks from. Then they'd dug out a decent ditch in front, and lined it with sharp\nstakes.\nThey were still digging, over on the left where the wall met the cliff and it was\neasiest to climb over. That was Dow's stretch, and Logen could hear him shouting at\nhis boys over the sound of shovels. 'Get digging, you lazy fucks! I'll not be killed for\nyour lack of work! Put your back into it, you bastards!' and so on, all day long. One\nway of getting work out of a man, Logen reckoned.\nThey'd dug the ditch out especially deep right in front of the old gate. A nice\nreminder to everyone that there were no plans to leave. But it was still the weakest\nspot, and there was no missing it. That was where Logen would be, if Bethod came.\nRight in the middle, on Shivers' stretch of wall. He was standing above the archway"

He was standing above the archway\nnow, not far from Logen and Crummock, his long hair flapping about in the breeze,\npointing out some cracks that still needed mortaring.\n'Wall's looking good!' Logen shouted at him.\nShivers looked round, worked his mouth, then spat over his shoulder. 'Aye,' he\ngrowled, and turned away.\nCrummock leaned close. 'If it comes to a battle you'll have to watch your back\nwith that one, Bloody-Nine.'\n'I reckon so.' The middle of a fight was a good place to settle a score with a man\non your own side. No one ever checked too carefully if the corpses got it in the back\nor the front once the fighting was done. Everyone too busy crying at their cuts, or\ndigging, or running away. Logen gave the big hillman a long stare. 'I'll have a lot of\nmen to watch if it comes to a battle. We ain't so very friendly that you won't be one\nof em.\n'Likewise,' said Crummock, grinning all the way across his big, bearded face.\n'We both got a reputation for being none too picky who gets killed, once the killing\nstarts. But that's no bad thing. Too much trust makes men sloppy.'\n'Too much trust?' It had been a while since Logen had too much of anything\nexcept enemies. He jerked his thumb towards the tower. 'I'm going up, check if\nthey've seen anything.'\n'I hope they have!' said Crummock, rubbing his fat palms together. 'I hope that\nbastard comes today!'\nLogen hopped down from the wall and walked out across the fort, if you could\ncall it that, past Carls and hillmen, sat in groups eating, or talking, or cleaning\nweapons. A few who'd been on guard through the night wrapped up in blankets,\nasleep. He passed the pen where the sheep were huddled together, a good deal fewer\nthan there had been. He passed the makeshift forge set up near the stone shed, a\ncouple of soot-smeared men working a bellows, another pouring metal into moulds\nfor arrow heads. They'd need a damn lot of arrow-heads if Bethod came calling. He\ncame to the narrow steps cut into the rock-face and took them two at a time, up\nabove the fort to the top of the tower.\nThere was a big pile of rocks for throwing up there, on that shelf on the\nmountainside, and six big barrels wedged full of shafts. The pick of the archers\nstood at the new-mortared parapets, the men with the best eyes and the best ears,\nkeeping watch for Bethod. Logen saw the Dogman in amongst the rest, with Grim on\none side of him and Tul on the other.\n'Chief!' It still made Logen smile to say it. A long time, they'd done things the\nother way around, but it worked a lot better like this, to his mind. At least no one\nwas scared all the time. Not of their own chief, anyway. 'See anything?'\nThe Dogman grinned round, and offered him out a flask. 'A lot, as it goes.'"

The sun was getting up above the mountains now, slitting the\nclouds with bright lines, eating into the shadows across the hard land, burning away\nthe dawn haze. The great fells loomed up bold and careless on either side, smeared\nwith yellow green grass and fern on the slopes, strips of bare rock breaking through\nthe brown summits. Below, the bare valley was quiet and still. Spotted with thorn\nbushes and clumps of stunted trees, creased with the paths of dried-out streams.\nJust as empty as it had been the day before, and the day before that, and ever since\nthey'd got there.\nIt reminded Logen of his youth, climbing up in the High Places, alone. Days at a\ntime, testing himself against the mountains. Before his was a name that anyone had\nheard of. Before he married, or had children, and before his wife and his children\nwent back to the mud. The happy valleys of the past. He sucked in a long, cold\nbreath of the high air, and he blew it out. 'It's quite a spot for a view, alright, but I\nmeant have we seen anything of our old friend.'\n'You mean Bethod, the right royal King of the Northmen? No, no sign of him.\nNot a hair.'\nTul shook his big head. 'Would've expected there to be some sign by now, if he\nwas coming.'\nLogen sloshed some water round his mouth and spat it out over the side of the\ntower, watched it splatter on the rocks way down below. 'Maybe he won't fall for it.'\nHe could see the happy side of Bethod not coming. Vengeance is a nice enough\nnotion at a distance, but the getting of it close up isn't so very pretty. Especially\nwhen you're outnumbered ten to one with nowhere to run to.\n'Maybe he won't at that,' said Dogman, wistful. 'How's the wall?'\n'Alright, long as they don't bring such a thing as a ladder with 'em. How long do\nyou reckon we wait, before we—'\n'Uh,' grunted Grim, his long finger pointing down into the valley.\nLogen saw a flicker of movement down there. And again. He swallowed. A\ncouple of men, maybe, creeping through the boulders like beetles through gravel. He\nfelt the men tense up all around him, heard them muttering. 'Shit,' he hissed. He\nlooked sideways at the Dogman, and the Dogman looked back. 'Seems like\nCrummock's plan worked.'\n'Seems that way. Far as getting Bethod to follow us, at least.'\n'Aye. The rest is the tricky bit.' The bit that was more than likely to get them all\nkilled, but Logen knew they were all thinking it without him saying a word.\n'Now we just hope that the Union keeps their end of the deal,' said Dogman.\n'We hope.' Logen tried to smile, but it didn't come out too good. Hoping had\nnever turned out that well for him."

        "text": "'We hope.' Logen tried to smile, but it didn't come out too good. Hoping had\nnever turned out that well for him.\nOnce they'd started coming, the valley had filled up quick, right in front of Dogman's\neyes. Nice and clean, just the way Bethod had always done things. The standards\nwere set out between the two rock faces, three times a good bowshot distant, and\nthe Carls and the Thralls were pressed in tight around 'em, all looking up towards\ntheir wall. The sun was getting up high in a blue sky with just a few shreds of cloud\nto cast a shadow, and all that weight of steel flashed and sparked like the sea under\nthe moon.\nTheir signs were all there, all Bethod's best from way back—Whitesides, Goring,\nPale-as-Snow, Littlebone. Then there were others—sharp and ragged marks from\nout past the Crinna. Wild men, made dark and bloody deals with Bethod. Dogman\ncould hear them whooping and calling to each other, strange sounds like animals\nmight make in the forest.\nQuite a gathering, all in all, and the Dogman could smell the fear and the doubt\nthick as soup up on the wall. A lot of weapons being fingered, a lot of lips being\nchewed. He did his best to keep his face hard and careless, the way that Threetrees\nwould've done. The way a chief should. However much his own knees wanted to\ntremble.\n'How many now, you reckon?' asked Logen.\nDogman let his eyes wander over 'em, thinking about it. 'Eight thousand do you\nthink, or ten, maybe?'\nA pause. 'That's about what I was thinking.'\n'A lot more'n us, anyway,' Dogman said, keeping his voice low.\n'Aye. But fights aren't always won by the bigger numbers.'\n'Course not.' Dogman worked his lips as he looked at all them men. 'Just mostly.'\nThere was plenty going on down there, up at the front, shovels glinting, a ditch and\nan earth rampart taking shape, all across the valley.\n'Doing some digging o' their own,' grunted Dow.\n'Always was thorough, was Bethod,' said Dogman. 'Taking his time. Doing it\nright.'\nLogen nodded. 'Make sure none of us get away.'\nDogman heard the sound of Crummock's laughter behind him. 'Getting away\nwasn't ever the purpose o' this, though, eh?'\nBethod's own standard was going up now, near to the back but still towering\nover the others. Huge great thing, red circle on black. Dogman frowned at it,\nflapping in the breeze. He remembered seeing it months ago, back in Angland. Back\nwhen Threetrees had still been alive, and Cathil too. He worked his tongue round his\nsour mouth.\n'King o' the fucking Northmen,' he muttered.\nA few men came out from the front, where they were digging, started walking up\ntowards the wall. Five of 'em, all in good armour, the one at the front with his arms\nspread out wide.\n'Jawing time,' muttered Dow, then gobbed down into the ditch.

They came up\nclose, the five, up in front of the patched-up gate, mail coats shining dull in the\nbrightening sun. The first of 'em had long white hair and one white eye, and weren't\ntoo hard to remember. White-Eye Hansul. He looked older than he used to, but\ndidn't they all? He'd been the one to ask Threetrees to surrender, at Uffrith, and been\ntold to piss off. He'd had shit thrown down on him at Heonan. He'd offered duels to\nBlack Dow, and to Tul Duru, and to Harding Grim. Duels against Bethod's\nchampion. Duels against the Bloody-Nine. He'd done a lot of talking for Bethod, and\nhe'd told a lot o' lies.\n'That Shite-Eye Hansul down there?' jeered Black Daw at him. 'Still sucking on\nBethod's cock, are you?'\nThe old warrior grinned up at them. 'Man's got to feed his family somehow, don't\nhe, and one cock tastes pretty much like another, if you ask me! Don't pretend like\nyour mouths ain't all tasted salty enough before!'\nHe had some kind of point there, the Dogman had to admit. They'd all fought for\nBethod themselves, after all. 'What're you after, Hansul?' he shouted. 'Bethod want\nto surrender to us, does he?'\n'You'd have thought so, wouldn't you, outnumbered like he is, but that's not why\nI'm here. He's ready to fight, just like always, but I'm more of a talker than a fighter,\nand I talked him into giving you all a chance. I got two sons down there, in with the\nrest, and call me selfish but I'd rather not have 'em in harm's way. I'm hoping we can\nmaybe talk our way clear of this.'\n'Don't seem too likely!' shouted Dogman, 'but give it a go if you must, I've got\nnothing else pressing on today!'\n'Here's the thing, then! Bethod don't particularly want to waste time, and sweat,\nand blood on climbing your little shit-pile of a wall. He's got business with the\nSoutherners he wants to get settled. It's scarcely worth the breath of pointing out the\nbastard of a fix you're in. We've got the numbers more'n ten to one, I reckon. Much\nmore, and you've no way out. Bethod says any man wants to give up now can go in\npeace. All he has to do is give over his weapons.'\n'And his head soon afterwards, eh?' barked Dow.\nHansul took a big breath in, like he hardly expected to be believed. 'Bethod says\nany man wants to can go free. That's his word.'\n'Fuck his word!' Dow sneered at him, and down the walls men jeered and spat\ntheir support. 'D'you think we ain't all seen him break it ten times before? I done shits\nworth more!'\n'Lies, o' course,' chuckled Crummock, 'but it's traditional, no?

You'd feel insulted if he didn't\ngive it some kind of a try at least. Any man, is it?' he called down. 'What about\nCrummock-i-Phail, can he go free? What about the Bloody-Nine?'\nHansul's face sagged at the name. 'It's true then? Ninefingers is up there, is he?'\nDogman felt Logen come up beside and show himself on the wall. White-Eye\nturned pale, and his shoulders slumped. 'Well,' Dogman heard him saying quiet, 'it\nhas to be blood, then.'\nLogen leaned lazily on the parapet, and he gave Hansul and his Carls a look. That\nhungry, empty look, like he was picking which one of a herd o' sheep to slaughter\nfirst. 'You can tell Bethod we'll come out.' He left a pause. 'Once we've killed the\nfucking lot o' you.'\nA ripple of laughter went down the walls, and men jeered and shook their\nweapons in the air. Not funny words, particularly, but hard ones, which was what\nthey all needed to hear, Dogman reckoned. Good way to get rid of their fear, for a\nmoment. He even managed half a smile himself.\nWhite-Eye just stood there, in front of their rickety gate, and he waited for the\nboys to go quiet. 'I heard you was chief of this crowd now, Dogman. So you don't\nhave to take your orders from this blood-mad butcher no more. That your answer as\nwell? That the way it is?'\nDogman shrugged. 'Just what other way did you think it'd be? We didn't come\nhere to talk, Hansul. You can piss off back, now.'\nSome more laughter, and some more cheers, and one lad down at Shivers' end of\nthe wall pulled his trousers down and stuck his bare arse over the parapet. So that\nwas that for the negotiations.\nWhite-Eye shook his head. 'Alright, then. I'll tell him. Back to the mud with the lot\no' you, I reckon, and well earned. You can tell the dead I tried, when you meet 'em!'\nHe started picking his way back down the valley, the four Carls behind him.\nLogen loomed forward, all of a sudden. 'I'll be looking for your sons, Hansul!' he\nscreamed, spit flying out his snarling, grinning mouth and away into the wind, 'When\nthe work begins! You can tell Bethod I'm waiting! Tell 'em all I'll be waiting!'\nA strange stillness fell on the wall and the men upon it, on the valley and the men\nwithin it. That kind of stillness that comes sometimes, before a battle, when both\nsides know what to expect. The same stillness that Logen had felt at Carleon, before\nhe drew his sword and roared for the charge. Before he lost his finger. Before he\nwas the Bloody-Nine.

The Dogman had climbed the steps back to the tower,\nno doubt taken up his bow beside Grim and Tul, and was waiting. Crummock was\nbehind the wall with his Hillmen, lined up fierce and ready. Dow was with his lads on\nthe left. Red Hat was with his boys on the right. Shivers wasn't far from Logen, both\nof them stood above the gate, waiting.\nThe standards down in the valley flapped and rustled gently in the wind. A\nhammer clanged once, twice, three times in the fortress behind them. A bird called,\nhigh above. A man whispered, somewhere, then was still. Logen closed his eyes,\nand tipped his face back, and he felt the hot sun and the cool breeze of the High\nPlaces on his skin. All as quiet as if he'd been alone, and there were no ten thousand\nmen about him eager to set to killing one another. So still, and calm, he almost\nsmiled. Was this what life would have been, if he'd never held a blade?\nFor the length of three breaths or so, Logen Ninefingers was a man of peace.\nThen he heard the sound of men moving, and he opened his eyes. Bethod's Carls\nshuffled to the sides of the valley, rank after rank of them, with a crunching of feet\nand a rattling of gear. They left a rocky path, an open space through their midst. Out\nof that gap black shapes came, swarming over the ditch like angry ants from a\nbroken nest, boiling up the slope towards the wall in a formless mass of twisted\nlimbs, and snarling mouths and scraping claws.\nShanka, and even Logen had never seen half so many in one place. The valley\ncrawled with them—a gibbering, clattering, squawking infestation.\n'By the fucking dead,' someone whispered.\nLogen wondered if he should shout something to the men on the walls around\nhim. If he should cry, 'Steady!', or 'Hold!'. Something to help put some heart in his\nlads, the way a leader was meant to. But what would have been the point? Every one\nof them had fought before and knew his business. Every one of them knew that it\nwas fight or die, and there was no better spur to a man's courage than that.\nSo Logen gritted his teeth, and he curled his fingers tight round the cold grip of\nthe Maker's sword, and he slid the dull metal from its scarred sheath, and he\nwatched the Flatheads come. A hundred strides away now, maybe, the front runners,\nand coming on fast.\n'Ready your bows!' roared Logen.\n'Bows!' echoed Shivers.\n'Arrows!' came Dow's harsh scream from down the wall, and Red Hat's bellow\nfrom the other side. All around Logen the bows creaked as they were drawn, men\ntaking their aim, jaws clenched, faces grim and dirty. The Flatheads came on,\nheedless, teeth shining, tongues lolling, bitter eyes bright with hate. Soon, now, very\nsoon. Logen spun the grip of the sword round in his hand."

Logen spun the grip of the sword round in his hand.\n'Soon,' he whispered.\n'Start fucking shooting, then!' And the Dogman loosed his shaft into the crowd of\nShanka. Strings buzzed all round him and the first volley went hissing down. Arrows\nmissed their marks, bounced off rock and spun away, arrows found their marks and\nbrought Flatheads squealing down in a tangle of black limbs. Men reached for more,\ncalm and solid, the best archers in the whole crew and knowing it.\nBows clicked and shafts twittered and Shanka died down in the valley, and the\narchers took aim, nice and easy, loosing 'em off and on to the next. Dogman heard\nthe order from down below and he saw the twitch and flicker of shafts flying from\nthe walls. More Flatheads dropped, thrashing and struggling in the dirt.\n'Easy as squashing ants in a bowl!' someone shouted.\n'Aye!' growled the Dogman, 'except ants won't climb up out of that bowl and cut\nyour fucking head off! Less talk and more arrows!' He watched the first Shanka\ncome up to their fresh-dug ditch, start floundering in, trying to drag the stakes down,\nscrabbling about at the bottom of the wall.\nTul heaved a great stone up over his head, leaned out and flung it spinning down\nwith a roar. Dogman saw it crash into a Shanka's head below in the ditch and dash\nits brains out, red against the rocks, saw it bounce and tumble into others, send a\ncouple reeling. More fell, screeching as shafts flitted down into them, but there were\nplenty behind, sliding into the ditch, swarming over each other. They crushed up to\nthe wall, spreading out down its length, a few of them hurling spears up at the men\non top, or shooting clumsy arrows.\nNow they were starting to climb, claws digging into pitted stone, hauling\nthemselves up, and up. Slow across most of the wall, and getting torn off by rocks\nand arrows from above. Quicker on the far side, over on the left, furthest from the\nDogman and his boys, where Black Dow had the watch. Even quicker round the\ngate, where there was still some ivy stuck to the stone.\n'Damn it, but those bastards can climb!' hissed the Dogman, fumbling out his\nnext shaft.\n'Uh,' grunted Grim.\nThe Shanka's hand slapped down on the top of the parapet, a twisted claw,\nscratching at the stones. Logen watched the arm come after, bent and ugly, patched\nwith thick hair and squirming with thick sinew. Now came the flattened top of its\nbald head, a hulking lump of heavy brow, great jaw yawning wide, sharp teeth slick\nwith spit. The deep set eyes met his. Logen's sword split its skull down to its flat\nstub of nose and popped one eye from its socket.\nMen shot arrows and ducked down as arrows bounced from stone.

Down below he could hear the Shanka scratching\nand tearing at the gates, beating at them with clubs and hammers, could hear them\nshrieking with rage. Shanka hissed and squawked as they tried to pull themselves\nover the parapet and men hacked at them with sword and axe, poked them off the\nwall with spears.\nHe could hear Shivers roaring, 'Get 'em away from the gate! Away from the gate!'\nMen bellowed curses. One Carl who'd been leaning out over the parapet fell back,\ncoughing. He had a Shanka's spear through him, just under his shoulder, the point\nmaking the shirt stick right up off his back. He blinked down at the warped shaft,\nopened his mouth to say something. He groaned, took a couple of wobbling steps,\nand a big Flathead started dragging itself over the parapet behind him, its arm\nstretched out on the stone.\nThe Maker's sword chopped deep into it just below the elbow, spattering sticky\nspots across Logen's face. The blade caught stone and made his hand sing, sent him\nstumbling long enough for the Shanka to drag itself over, its flopping arm only just\nheld on by a flap of skin and sinew, dark blood drooling out in long spurts.\nIt came for Logen with its other claw but he caught its wrist, kicked its knee\nsideways and brought it down. Before it could get up he'd chopped a long gash out\nof its back, splinters of white bone showing in the great wound. It thrashed and\nstruggled, splattering blood around, and Logen caught it tight under the throat,\nheaved it back over the wall and flung it off. It fell, and crashed into another just\nstarting to climb. Both of them went sprawling in the ditch, one scrabbling around\nwith a broken stake in its throat.\nA young lad stood there, gawping, bow hanging limp from his hand.\n'Did I tell you to stop fucking shooting?' Logen roared at him, and he blinked and\nnocked a shaft with a trembling hand, hurried back to the parapet. There were men\neverywhere fighting, and shouting, shooting arrows and swinging blades. He saw\nthree Carls stabbing at a Flathead with their spears. He saw Shivers plant a blow in\nthe small of another's back, blood leaping in the air in dark streaks. He saw a man\nsmash a Flathead in the face with his shield, just as it got to the top of the wall, and\nknock it into the empty air. Logen slashed at a Shanka's hand, slipped in some blood\nand fell on his side, nearly stabbed himself. He crawled a stride or two and fumbled\nhis way up. He hacked a Shanka's arm off that was already spitted thrashing on a\nCarl's spear, chopped halfway through another's neck as it showed itself over the\nparapet. He lurched after it and stared over.\nOne Shanka was still on the wall, and Logen was just pointing to it when an arrow\nfrom off the tower took it in the back.

The ones round the gate were all done, crushed with rocks and bristling with\nbroken arrows. That was it for the centre, and Red Hat's side was already clear.\nOver on the left there were still a few up on the walls, but Dow's boys were getting\nwell on top of them now. Even as Logen watched he saw a couple flung down\nbloody into the ditch.\nIn the valley they started wavering, edging away, squeaking and shrieking, arrows\nstill falling among them from the Dogman's archers. Seemed that even Shanka could\nhave enough. They started to turn, to scuttle back towards Bethod's ditch.\n'We done 'em!' someone bellowed, and then everyone was cheering and\nscreaming. The boy with the bow was waving it over his head now, grinning like he'd\nbeaten Bethod all by himself.\nLogen didn't celebrate. He frowned out at the great crowd of Carls beyond the\nditch, the standards of Bethod's host flapping over them in the breeze. Brief and\nbloody, that one might have been, but the next time they came it was likely to be a lot\nless brief, and a lot more bloody. He made his aching fist uncurl from round the\nMaker's sword, leaned it up against the parapet, and he pressed one hand with the\nother to stop them shaking. He took a long breath.\n'Still alive,' he whispered.\nLogen sat sharpening his knives, the firelight flashing on the blades as he turned them\nthis way and that, stroking them with the whetstone, licking his fingertip and wiping a\nsmudge away, getting them nice and clean. You could never have too many, and that\nwas a fact. He grinned as he remembered what Ferro's answer to that had been.\nUnless you fall into a river and drown for all that weight of iron. He wondered for an\nidle moment if he'd ever see her again, but it didn't look likely. You have to be\nrealistic, after all, and getting through tomorrow seemed like quite the ambition.\nGrim sat opposite, trimming some straight sticks to use as arrow shafts. There'd\nstill been the slightest glimmer of dusk in the sky when they'd sat down together.\nNow it was dark as pitch but for the dusty stars, and neither one of them had said a\nword the whole time. That was Harding Grim for you, and it suited Logen well\nenough. A comfortable silence was much preferable to a worrisome conversation,\nbut nothing lasts forever.\nThe sound of angry footsteps came out of the darkness and Black Dow stalked\nup to the fire, Tul and Crummock just behind him. He had a frown on his face black\nenough to have earned his name, and a dirty bandage round his forearm, a long\nstreak of dark blood dried into it.\n'Pick up a cut, did you?' asked Logen.\n'Bah!' Dow dropped down beside the fire. 'Nothing but a scratch. Fucking\nFlatheads! I'll burn the lot of 'em!'\n'How about the rest of you?'"

'My palms are terrible chafed from hefting rocks, but I'm a tough\nbastard. I'll live through it.'\n'And I still find myself miserably idle,' said Crummock, 'with my children looking\nto my weapons, and cutting arrows from the dead. Good work for children, that,\ngets 'em comfortable round a corpse. The moon's keen to see me fight, though, so\nshe is, and so am I.'\nLogen sucked at his teeth. 'You'll get your chance, Crummock, I'd not worry\nabout that. Bethod's got plenty for everyone, I reckon.'\n'I never seen Flatheads come on like that,' Dow was musing. 'Right at a\nwell-manned wall with no ladders, no tools. It ain't too clever, your Flathead, but it\nain't stupid either. They like ambushes. They like cover, and hiding, and creeping\naround. They can be mad fearless, when they have to be, but to come on like that,\nby choice? Not natural.'\nCrummock chuckled, a great raspy rumbling. 'Shanka fighting for one set of men\nagainst another ain't natural either. These aren't natural times. Might be Bethod's\nwitch has worked some charm to get 'em all stirred up. Cooked herself a chant and a\nritual to fill those things with hate of us.'\n'Danced naked round a green fire and all the rest, I don't doubt,' said Tul.\n'The moon will see us right, my friends, don't worry yourself on that score!'\nCrummock rattled the bones around his neck. 'The moon loves us all, and we cannot\ndie while there's—'\n'Tell it to those as went back to the mud today.' Logen jerked his head over\ntowards the fresh dug graves at the back of the fortress. There was no seeing them\nin the darkness, but they were there. A score or so long humps of turned and\npressed-down earth.\nBut the big hillman only smiled. 'I'd call them the happy ones, though, wouldn't\nyou? Least they all get their own beds, don't they? We'll be lucky if we don't go in\npits for a dozen each once the work gets hot. There'll be nowhere for the living to\nsleep otherwise. Pits for a score! Don't tell me you ain't seen that before, or dug the\nholes your own sweet self.'\nLogen got up. 'Maybe I have, but I didn't like it any.'\n'Course you did!' Crummock roared after him. 'Don't give me that, Bloody-Nine!'\nLogen didn't look back. There were torches set on the wall, every ten paces or\nso, bright flames in the darkness, white specks of insects floating around them. Men\nstood in their light, leaning on their spears, bows clenched in their hands, swords\ndrawn, watching the night for surprises. Bethod had always loved surprises, and\nLogen reckoned they'd have some before they were through, one way or another.\nHe came up to the parapet and set his hands on the clammy stone, frowned down"

Bethod's fires, far away in the dark,\nand their own ones, bonfires built up and lit just below the wall to try and catch any\nclever bastards trying to sneak up. They cast flickering circles across the shadowy\nrocks, with here or there the twisted corpse of a Flathead, hacked and flung from the\nwall or stuck with arrows.\nLogen felt someone move behind him and his back prickled, eyes sliding to the\ncorners. Shivers, maybe, come to settle their score and shove him off the wall.\nShivers, or one of a hundred others with some grudge that Logen had forgotten but\nthey never would. He made sure his hand was close to a blade, and he bared his\nteeth, and he made ready to spin and strike.\n'We did good today, though, eh?' said the Dogman. 'Lost less than twenty.'\nLogen breathed easy again, and he let his hand drop. 'We did alright. But\nBethod's just getting started. He's prodding, to see where we're weakest, see if he\ncan wear us down. He knows that time's the thing. Most valuable thing there is, in\nwar. A day or two's worth more to him than a load of Flatheads. If he can crush us\nquick he'll take the losses, I reckon.'\n'Best thing might be to hold out, then, eh?'\nOff in the darkness, far away and echoing, Logen could just hear the clang and\nclatter of smithing and carpentry. 'They're building down there. All the stuff they'll\nneed to climb our wall, fill in our ditch. Lots of ladders, and all the rest. He'll take us\nquick if he can, Bethod, but he'll take us slow if he has to.'\nDogman nodded. 'Well, like I said. Best thing to do would be to hold out.

He had sat as\nthe sun went down, and hundreds of candles were lit and hoisted up, twinkling at\nhim from the mirrors, and the darkened windows, and the highly polished floor. He\nsat, smiling, and receiving praise from men whose countries he had scarcely even\nheard of before that endless day began.\n'… His Resplendence furthermore hopes and trusts that the hostilities between\nyour great nation and the Empire of Gurkhul may soon come to an end, and that\ntrade may once more flow freely around the Circle Sea.'\nBoth ambassador and translator paused politely for a rare instant and Jezal\nmanaged to stir himself into sluggish speech. 'We have a similar hope. Please convey\nto the Grand Duke our thanks for the wonderful gift.' Two lackeys, meanwhile,\nheaved the huge chest to one side and placed it with the rest of the gaudy rubbish\nJezal had accumulated that day.\nFurther Styrian chatter flowed out into the room. 'His Resplendence wishes to\nconvey his heartfelt congratulations on your August Majesty's forthcoming marriage\nto the Princess Terez, the Jewel of Talins, surely the greatest beauty alive in all the\nwide Circle of the World.' Jezal could only fight to maintain his stretched grin. He\nhad heard the match spoken of as a settled thing so often that day that he had lost\nthe will to correct the misconception, and had in fact almost started to think of\nhimself as engaged. All he cared about was that the audiences should finally be\nfinished with, so he might steal a moment to drown himself in peace.\n'His Resplendence has further instructed us to wish your August Majesty a long\nand happy reign,' explained the translator, 'and many heirs, that your line may\ncontinue undiminished in glory.' Jezal forced his smile a tooth wider, and inclined his\nhead. 'I bid you good evening!'\nThe Osprian ambassador bowed with a theatrical flourish, sweeping off his\nenormous hat, its multicoloured feathers thrashing with enthusiasm.

Nothing helped. He still felt dizzy,\nweak, oppressively hot.\nHoff was already ingratiating himself onto Jezal's left side. 'That was the last of\nthe ambassadors, your Majesty. Tomorrow will be occupied by the nobility of\nMidderland. They are eager to pay homage—'\n'Lots of homage and little help, I'll be bound!'\nHoff managed a chuckle of suffocating falseness. 'Ha, ha, ha, your Majesty. They\nhave sought audiences from dawn, and we would not wish to offend them by—'\n'Damn it!' hissed Jezal, jumping up and shaking his legs in a vain effort to unstick\nhis trousers from his sweaty backside. He jerked his crimson sash over his head and\nflung it away, tore his gilded frock coat open and tried to rip it off, but in the end he\ngot his hand caught in one cuff and had to turn the bloody thing inside out before he\ncould finally get free of it.\n'Damn it!' He hurled it down on the marble dais with half a mind to stamp it to\nrags. Then he remembered himself. Hoff had taken a cautious step back, and was\nfrowning as if he had discovered his fine new mansion was afflicted with a terrible\ncase of rot. The assorted servants, pages, and Knights, both Herald and of the\nBody, were all staring studiously ahead, doing their best to imitate statues. Over in\nthe dark corner of the room, Bayaz was standing. His eyes were sunk in shadow, but\nhis face was stony grim.\nJezal blushed like a naughty schoolboy called to account, and pressed one hand\nover his eyes, 'A terribly trying day…' He hurried down the steps of the dais and out\nof the audience chamber with his head down. The blaring of a belated and slightly\noff-key fanfare pursued him down the hallway. So, unfortunately, did the First of the\nMagi.\n'That was not gracious,' said Bayaz. 'Rare rages render a man frightening.\nCommon ones render him ridiculous.'\n'I apologise,' growled Jezal through gritted teeth. 'The crown is a mighty burden.'\n'A mighty burden and a mighty honour both. We had a discussion, as I recall,\nabout your striving to be worthy of it.' The Magus left a significant pause.

He shook himself, squeezed his eyes\nshut, let his head tip back and took a long, slow breath. A minute alone. He\nwondered if, aside from pissing or sleeping, it was the first he had been permitted\nsince that day of madness in the Lords' Round.\nHe was the victim, or perhaps the beneficiary, of the most almighty blunder.\nSomehow, everyone had mistaken him for a king, when he was very clearly a selfish,\nclueless idiot who had scarcely in his life thought more than a day ahead. Every time\nsomeone called him, 'your Majesty' he felt more of a fraud, and with each moment\nthat passed he was more guiltily surprised not to have been found out.\nHe wandered across the perfect lawn, giving vent to a long, self-pitying sigh. It\ncaught in his throat. There was a Knight of the Body beside a doorway opposite,\nstanding to attention so rigidly that Jezal had hardly noticed him. He cursed under his\nbreath. Could he not be left alone for five minutes together? He frowned as he\nwalked closer. The man seemed somehow familiar. A great big fellow with a shaved\nhead and a noticeable lack of neck…\n'Bremer dan Gorst!'\n'Your Majesty,' said Gorst, his armour rattling as he clashed his meaty fist against\nhis polished breastplate.\n'It is a pleasure to see you!' Jezal had disliked the man from the first moment he\nhad laid eyes on him, and being bludgeoned round a fencing circle by him, whether\nJezal had won in the end or no, had not improved his opinion of the neckless brute.\nNow, however, anything resembling a familiar face was like a glass of water in the\ndesert. Jezal actually found himself reaching out and squeezing the man's heavy hand\nas though they were old friends, and had to make himself let go of it.\n'Your Majesty does me too much honour.'\n'Please, you need not call me that! How did you come to be part of the\nhousehold? I thought that you served with Lord Brock's guard?'\n'That post did not suit me,' said Gorst in his strangely high, piping voice. 'I was\nlucky enough to find a place with the Knights of the Body some months ago, your\nMaj—' He cut himself off.\nAn idea slunk into Jezal's head. He looked over his shoulder, but there was no\none else nearby. The garden was still as a graveyard, its shadowy arcades as quiet as\ncrypts. 'Bremer… I may call you Bremer, may I?'\n'I suppose that my king may call me whatever he wishes.'\n'I wonder… could I ask you for a favour?'\nGorst blinked. 'Your Majesty has only to ask.'\nJezal spun around as he heard the door open. Gorst stepped out into the colonnade\nwith the soft jingle of armour. A cloaked and hooded figure followed him, silently.\nThe old excitement was still there as she pushed back her hood and a chink of light\nfrom a window above crept across the lower part of her face.

He could see the\nbright curve of her cheek, one side of her mouth, the outline of a nostril, the gleam of\nher eyes in the shadows, and that was all.\n'Thank you, Gorst,' said Jezal. 'You may leave us.' The big man thumped his\nchest and backed through the archway, pulling the door to behind him. Hardly the\nfirst time they had met in secret, of course, but things were different now. He\nwondered if it would end with kisses and soft words between them, or if it would\nsimply end. The start was far from promising.\n'Your August Majesty,' said Ardee with the very heaviest of irony. 'What a\ntowering honour. Should I grovel on my face? Or do I curtsey?'\nHowever hard her words, the sound of her voice still made the breath catch in his\nthroat. 'Curtsey?' he managed to say. 'Do you even know how?'\n'In truth, not really. I have not had the training for polite society, and now the lack\nof it quite crushes me.' She stepped forward, frowning into the darkened garden.\n'When I was a girl, in my wildest flights of fancy, I used to dream of being invited to\nthe palace, a guest of the king himself. We would eat fine cakes, and drink fine wine,\nand talk fine talk of important things, deep into the night.' Ardee pressed her hands\nto her chest and fluttered her eyelashes.

You promised me you would not let me\ndown.'\n'I know I did, and I meant to keep my promise… but the fact is…' King or not,\nhe fumbled with the words as much as he ever had, then blurted them out in an\nidiotic spurt. 'I cannot marry you! I surely would have done, had not…' He raised\nhis arms and hopelessly let them drop. 'Had not all this happened. But it has\nhappened, and there is nothing that I can do. I cannot marry you.'\n'Of course not.' Her mouth gave a bitter twist. 'Promises are for children. I never\nthought it very likely, even before. Even in my most unrealistic moments. Now the\nnotion seems ridiculous. The king and the peasant-girl. Absurd. The most hackneyed\nstory-book would never dare suggest it.'\n'It need not mean that we never see each other again.' He took a hesitant step\ntowards her. 'Things will be different, of course, but we can still find moments…' He\nreached out, slowly, awkwardly. 'Moments when we can be together.'

'A whore is still a whore, whatever word you use. Easily tired of, and even\nmore easily replaced. And when you tire of me, and you find other lovers? What will\nthey call me then?' She gave a bitter snort. 'I'm scum, and I know it, but you must\nthink even less of me than I do.'\n'It's not my fault.' He felt tears in his eyes. Pain, or relief, it was hard to tell. A\nbitter alloy of both, perhaps. 'It's not my fault.'\n'Of course it isn't. I don't blame you. I blame myself. I used to think I had bad\nluck, but my brother was right. I make bad choices.'

But then there had been the\nhope that they would meet again. Now there was none. She sighed, and let her arm\ndrop, and stared sulkily out into the garden.\nJezal blinked. Could that really be all? He yearned to say some last tender word,\nat least, some bitter-sweet farewell, but his mind was empty. What words could there\npossibly be that could make any difference? They were done, and more talk would\nonly have been salt in the cuts. Wasted breath. He set his jaw, and wiped the last\ndamp streaks from his face. She was right. The king and the peasant-girl. What\ncould have been more ridiculous?\n'Gorst!' he barked. The door squealed open and the muscle-bound guardsman\nemerged from the shadows, his head humbly bowed. 'You may escort the lady back\nto her home.'\nHe nodded, and stood away from the dark archway. Ardee turned and walked\ntowards it, pulling up her hood, and Jezal watched her go.

She watched the boats, and the people flowing off them.\nShe watched for Yulwei. That was why she came here every day.\nThere was war between the Union and Gurkhul, a meaningless war with a lot of\ntalk and no fighting, and so no ships went to Kanta. But Yulwei went where he\npleased. He could take her back to the South, so she could have her vengeance on\nthe Gurkish. Until he came, she was trapped with the pinks. She ground her teeth,\nand clenched her fists, and grimaced at her own uselessness. Her boredom. Her\nwasted time. She would have prayed to God for Yulwei to come.\nBut God never listened.\nJezal dan Luthar, fool that he was, for reasons she could not comprehend, had\nbeen given a crown and made king. Bayaz, who Ferro was sure had been behind the\nwhole business, now spent every hour with him. Still trying to make him a leader of\nmen, no doubt. Just as he had all the long way across the plain and back, with small\nresults.\nJezal dan Luthar, the King of the Union. Ninefingers would have laughed long and\nhard at that, if he could have heard it. Ferro smiled to think of him laughing. Then\nshe realised that she was smiling, and made herself stop. Bayaz had promised her\nvengeance, and given her nothing, and left her mired here, powerless. There was\nnothing to smile at.\nShe sat, and watched the boats for Yulwei.\nShe did not watch for Ninefingers. She did not hope to see him slouch onto the\ndocks. That would have been a foolish, childish hope, belonging to the foolish child\nshe had been when the Gurkish took her for a slave. He would not change his mind\nand come back. She had made sure of it. Strange, though, how she kept thinking that\nshe saw him, in amongst the crowds.\nThe dockers had come to recognise her. They had shouted at her, for a while.\n'Come down here, my lovely, and give me a kiss!' one of them had called, and his\nfriends had laughed. Then Ferro had thrown half a brick at his head and knocked\nhim in the sea. He had nothing to say to her once they fished him out. None of them\nhad, and that suited her well enough.\nShe sat, and watched the boats.\nShe sat until the sun was low, casting a bright glare across the bottoms of the\nclouds, making the shifting waves sparkle. Until the crowds thinned out, and the\ncarts stopped moving, and the shouting and bustle of the docks faded to a dusty\nquiet. Until the breeze grew cool against her skin.\nYulwei was not coming today.\nShe climbed down from the roof of the warehouse and worked her way through\nthe back streets towards the Middleway.

She was being\nfollowed.\nHe did it well, and carefully. Sometimes closer, sometimes further back. Staying\nout of plain sight, but never hiding. She took a few turns to make sure, and he\nalways followed. He was dressed all in black, with long, lank hair and a mask\ncovering part of his face. All in black, like a shadow. Like the men that had chased\nher and Ninefingers, before they left for the Old Empire. She watched him out of the\ncorners of her eyes, never looking straight at him, never letting him know that she\nknew.\nHe would find out soon enough.\nShe took a turn down a dingy alley, stopped and waited behind the corner.\nPressed up against the grimy stonework, holding her breath. Her bow and her sword\nmight be far away, but shock was the only weapon she needed. That and her hands,\nand her feet, and her teeth.\nShe heard the footsteps coming. Careful footsteps, padding down the alley, so\nsoft she could barely hear them. She found that she was smiling. It felt good to have\nan enemy, to have a purpose. Very good, after so long without one. It filled the\nempty space inside her, even if it was only for a moment. She gritted her teeth,\nfeeling the fury swelling up in her chest. Hot and exciting. Safe and familiar. Like the\nkiss of an old lover, much missed.\nWhen he rounded the corner her fist was already swinging. It crunched into his\nmask and sent him reeling. She pressed in close, cracking him in the face with each\nhand and knocking his head right and left. He fumbled for a knife, but he was slow\nand dizzy and the blade was barely out of its sheath before she had his wrist tight.\nHer elbow snapped his head back, jabbed into his throat and left him gurgling. She\ntore the knife out of his limp hand, spun around and kicked him in the gut so he bent\nover. Her knee thudded into his mask and sent him onto his back in the dirt. She\nfollowed him down, her legs wrapping tight around his waist, her arm across his\nchest, his own knife pressed up against his throat.\n'Look at this,' she whispered in his face. 'I have picked up a shadow.'\n'Glugh,' came from behind his mask, his eyes still rolling.\n'Hard to talk with that on, eh?' And she slashed the straps of his mask with a jerk\nof the knife, the blade leaving a long scratch down his cheek. He did not look so\ndangerous without it. Much younger than she had thought, with a rash of spots\naround his chin and a growth of downy hair on his top lip. He jerked his head and\nhis eyes came back into focus. He snarled, tried to twist free, but she had him fast,\nand a touch of the knife against his neck soon calmed him.\n'Why are you following me?'\n'I'm not fucking—'\nFerro had never been a patient woman.

He did his best to ward\nher off, but all her weight was on his hips and he was helpless. Her arm crashed\nthrough his hands and into his mouth, his nose, his cheek, cracking his head back\nagainst the greasy cobbles. Four of those and the fight was out of him. His head\nlolled back, and she crouched down over him again and tucked the knife up under\nhis neck. Blood bubbled out of his nose and his mouth and ran down the side of his\nface in dark streaks.\n'Following me now?'\n'I just watch.' His voice clicked in his bloody mouth. 'I just watch. I don't give the\norders.'\nThe Gurkish soldiers did not give the orders to kill Ferro's people and make her a\nslave. That did not make them innocent. That did not make them safe from her.\n'Who does?'\nHe coughed, and his face twitched, bubbles of blood blew out of his swollen\nnostrils. Nothing else. Ferro frowned.\n'What?' She moved the knife down and pricked at his thigh with the point, 'you\nthink I never cut a cock off before?'\n'Glokta,' he mumbled, closing his eyes. 'I work… for Glokta.'\n'Glokta.' The name meant nothing to her, but it was something to follow.\nShe slid the knife back up, up to his neck. The lump on his throat rose and fell,\nbrushing against the edge of the blade. She clenched her jaw, and worked her fingers\nround the grip, frowning down. Tears had started to glitter in the corners of his eyes.\nBest to get it done, and away. Safest. But her hand was hard to move.\n'Give me a reason not to do it.'\nThe tears welled up and ran down the sides of his bloody face. 'My birds,' he\nwhispered.\n'Birds?'\n'There'll be no one to feed them. I deserve it, sure enough, but my birds…\nthey've done nothing.' She narrowed her eyes at him.\nBirds. Strange, the things that people have to live for.\nHer father had kept a bird. She remembered it, in a cage, hanging from a pole. A\nuseless thing, that could not even fly, only cling to a twig. He had taught it words.\nShe remembered watching him feeding it, when she was a child. Long ago, before\nthe Gurkish came.\n'Ssssss,' she hissed in his face, pressing the knife up against his neck and making\nhim cower. Then she pulled the blade away, got up and stood over him. 'The\nmoment when I see you again will be your last. Back to your birds, shadow.'\nHe nodded, his wet eyes wide, and she turned and stalked off down the dark\nalleyway, into the dusk. When she crossed a bridge she tossed the knife away. It\nvanished with a splash, and ripples spread out in growing circles across the slimy\nwater. A mistake, most likely, to have left that man alive. Mercy was always a\nmistake, in her experience.\nBut it seemed she was in a merciful mood today.\nQuestions\n« ^ »"

Mercy was always a\nmistake, in her experience.\nBut it seemed she was in a merciful mood today.\nQuestions\n« ^ »\nColonel Glokta was a magnificent dancer, of course, but with his leg feeling as stiff\nas it did it was difficult for him to truly shine. The constant buzzing of flies was a\nfurther distraction, and his partner was not helping. Ardee West looked well enough,\nbut her constant giggling was becoming quite the irritation.\n'Stop that!' snapped the Colonel, whirling her around the laboratory of the\nAdeptus Physical, the specimens in the jars pulsing and wobbling in time to the\nmusic.\n'Partially eaten,' grinned Kandelau, one eye enormously magnified through his\neyeglass. He pointed downwards with his tongs. 'This is a foot.'\nGlokta pushed the bushes aside, one hand pressed over his face. The butchered\ncorpse lay there, glistening red, scarcely recognisable as human. Ardee laughed and\nlaughed at the sight of it. 'Partially eaten!' she tittered at him. Colonel Glokta did not\nfind the business in any way amusing. The sound of flies was growing louder and\nlouder, threatening to drown out the music entirely. Worse yet, it was getting terribly\ncold in the park.\n'Careless of me,' said a voice from behind.\n'How do you mean?'\n'Just to leave it there. But sometimes it is better to move quickly, than to move\ncarefully, eh, cripple?'\n'I remember this,' murmured Glokta. It had grown colder yet, and he was\nshivering like a leaf. 'I remember this!'\n'Of course,' whispered the voice. A woman's voice, but not Ardee. A low and\nhissing voice, that made his eye twitch.\n'What can I do?' The Colonel could feel his gorge rising. The wounds in the red\nmeat yawned. The flies were so loud he could hardly hear the reply.\n'Perhaps you should go to the University, and ask for advice.' Icy breath brushed\nhis neck and made his back shiver. 'Perhaps while you are there… you could ask\nthem about the Seed.'\nGlokta lurched to the bottom of the steps and staggered sideways, falling back\nagainst the wall, the breath hissing over his wet tongue. His left leg trembled, his left\neye twitched, as though the two were connected by a cord of pain that cut into his\narse, guts, back, shoulder, neck, face, and tightened with every movement, however\nsmall.\nHe forced himself to be still. To breathe long and slow. He made his mind move\noff the pain and on to other things. Like Bayaz, and his failed quest for this Seed.\nAfter all, his Eminence is waiting, and is not known for his patience. He stretched\nhis neck out to either side and felt the bones clicking between his twisted\nshoulder-blades. He pressed his tongue into his gums and shuffled away from the\nsteps, into the cool darkness of the stacks.\nThey had not changed much in the past year. Or probably in a few centuries\nbefore that. The vaulted spaces smelled of fust and age, lit only by a couple of\nnickering, grimy lamps, sagging shelves stretching away into the shifting shadows."

The vaulted spaces smelled of fust and age, lit only by a couple of\nnickering, grimy lamps, sagging shelves stretching away into the shifting shadows.\nTime to go digging once again through the dusty refuse of history. The Adeptus\nHistorical did not appear to have changed much either. He sat at his stained desk,\nporing over a mouldy-looking pile of papers in the light from a single squirming\ncandle flame. He squinted up as Glokta hobbled closer.\n'Who's there?'\n'Glokta.' He peered up suspiciously towards the shadowy ceiling. 'What\nhappened to your crow?'\n'Dead,' grunted the ancient librarian sadly.\n'History, you might say!' The old man did not laugh. 'Ah, well. It happens to us\nall.' And some sooner than others. 'I have questions for you.'\nThe Adeptus Historical craned forward over his desk, peering dewily up at\nGlokta as though he had never seen another human before. 'I remember you.'\nMiracles do happen, then? 'You asked me about Bayaz. First apprentice of great\nJuvens, first letter in the alphabet of the—'\n'Yes, yes, we've been over this.'\nThe old man gave a sulky frown. 'Did you bring that scroll back?'\n'The Maker fell burning, and so on? I'm afraid not. The Arch Lector has it.'\n'Gah. I hear far too much about that man these days. Them upstairs are always\ncarping on him. His Eminence this, and his Eminence that. I'm sick of hearing it!' I\nknow very much how you feel. 'Everyone's in a spin, these days. A spin and a\nruckus.'\n'Lots of changes upstairs. We have a new king.'\n'I know that! Guslav, is it?'\nGlokta gave a long sigh as he settled himself in the chair on the other side of the\ndesk. 'Yes, yes, he's the one.' Only thirty years out of date, or so. I'm surprised he\ndidn't think Harod the Great was still on the throne.\n'What do you want this time?'\nOh, to fumble in the darkness for answers that are always just out of reach. 'I\nwant to know about the Seed.'\nThe lined face did not move. 'The what?'\n'It was mentioned in your precious scroll. That thing that Bayaz and his magical\nfriends searched for in the House of the Maker, after the death of Kanedias. After the\ndeath of Juvens.'\n'Bah!' The Adeptus waved his hand, the saggy flesh under his wrist wobbling.\n'Secrets, power. It's all a metaphor.'\n'Bayaz does not seem to think so.' Glokta shuffled his chair closer, and spoke\nlower. Though there cannot be anyone to hear, or to care if they did. 'I heard it was\na piece of the Other Side, left over from the Old Time, when devils walked our earth.\nThe stuff of magic, made solid.'\nThe old man wheezed with papery laughter, displaying a rotten cavern of a mouth\nwith fewer teeth even than Glokta's own.

Nor was I one, when I last came here with questions. Before my visit to\nthe House of the Maker, before my meeting with Yulwei, before I saw Shickel smile\nwhile they burned her. What happy times they were, before I had heard of Bayaz,\nwhen things still made sense. The Adeptus wiped his runny eyes with his palsied\nmockery of a hand. 'Where did you hear that?'\nOh, from a Navigator with his foot on an anvil. 'Never you mind from where.'\n'Well, you know more about it than me. I read once that rocks sometimes fall out\nof the sky. Some say they are fragments of the stars. Some say they are splinters,\nflung out from the chaos of hell. Dangerous to touch. Terribly cold.'\nCold? Glokta could almost feel that icy breath upon his neck, and he wriggled his\nshoulders at it, forcing himself not to glance behind him. 'Tell me about hell.'\nThough I think I already know more than most on the subject.\n'Eh?'\n'Hell, old man. The Other Side.'\n'They say it is where magic comes from, if you believe in such things.'\n'I have learned to keep an open mind on the subject.'\n'An open mind is like to an open wound, apt to—'\n'So I have heard, but we are speaking of hell.'\nThe librarian licked at his sagging lips. 'Legend has it that there was a time when\nour world and the world below were one, and devils roamed the earth. Great Euz\ncast them out, and spoke the First Law—forbidding all to touch the Other Side, or\nto speak to devils, or to tamper with the gates between.'\n'The First Law, eh?'\n'His son Glustrod, hungry for power, ignored his father's warnings, and he\nsought out secrets, and summoned devils, and sent them against his enemies. It is\nsaid his folly led to the destruction of Aulcus and the fall of the Old Empire, and that\nwhen he destroyed himself, he left the gates ajar… but I am not the expert on all\nthat.'\n'Who is?'\nThe old man grimaced. 'There were books here. Very old. Beautiful books, from\nthe time of the Master Maker. Books on the subject of the Other Side. The divide\nbetween. The gates and the locks. Books on the subject of the Tellers of Secrets,\nand of their summoning and sending. A load of invention if you ask me. Myth and\nfantasy.'\n'There were books?'\n'They have been missing from my shelves for some years now.'\n'Missing? Where are they?'\nThe old man frowned. 'Strange, that you of all people should ask that—'\n'Enough!' Glokta turned as quickly as he could to look behind him. Silber, the\nUniversity Administrator, stood at the foot of the steps, with a look of the strangest\nhorror and surprise on his rigid face. Quite as if he had seen a ghost. Or even a\ndemon. 'That will be quite enough, Superior! We thank you for your visit.'"

Glokta gave a frown of his own. 'His Eminence will not be—'\n'I know what his Eminence will or will not be…' An unpleasantly familiar voice.\nSuperior Goyle worked his way slowly down the steps. He strolled around Silber,\nacross the shadowy floor between the shelves. 'And I say enough. We most heartily\nthank you for your visit.' He leaned forwards, eyes popping furiously from his head.\n'Make it your last!'\nThere had been some startling changes in the dining hall since Glokta went\ndownstairs. The evening had grown dark outside the dirty windows, the candles had\nbeen lit in their tarnished sconces. And, of course, there is the matter of two dozen\nwidely assorted Practical of the Inquisition.\nTwo narrow-eyed natives of Suljuk sat staring at Glokta over their masks, as like\nas if they had been twins, their black boots up on the ancient dining table, four\ncurved swords lying sheathed on the wood before them. Three dark-skinned men\nstood near one dark window, heads shaved, each with an axe at his belt and a shield\non his back. A great tall Practical loomed up by the fireplace, long and thin as a\nbirch tree with blond hair hanging over his masked face. Beside was a short one,\nalmost dwarfish, his belt bristling with knives.\nGlokta recognised the huge Northman called the Stone-Splitter from his previous\nvisit to the University. But it looks as if he has been attempting to split stones with\nhis face since we last met, and with great persistence. His cheeks were uneven, his\nbrows were wonky, the bridge of his nose pointed sharply to the left. His ruin of a\nface was almost as disturbing as the enormous mallet he had clenched in his massive\nfists. But not quite.\nSo it went on, as strange and worrying a collection of murderers as could ever\nhave been collected together in one place, and all heavily armed. And it seems that\nSuperior Goyle has restocked his freak show. In the midst of them, and seeming\nquite at home, stood Practical Vitari, pointing this way and that, giving orders. You\nwould never have thought she was the mothering type, seeing her now, but I\nsuppose we all have our hidden talents.\nGlokta threw his right arm up in the air. 'Who are we killing?'\nAll eyes turned towards him. Vitari stalked over, a frown across the freckled\nbridge of her nose. 'What the hell are you doing here?'\n'I could ask you the same question.'\n'If you know what's good for you, you'll ask no questions at all.'\nGlokta leered his empty smile at her. 'If I knew what was good for me I'd never\nhave lost my teeth, and questions are all I have left. What's in this old pile of dust\nthat's of interest to you?'\n'That's none of my business, and even less of yours. If you're looking for\ntraitors, maybe you should look in your own house first, eh?'\n'And what is that supposed to mean?'"

'You saved my life,\nso let me return the favour. Get away from here. Get away, and keep away.'\nGlokta shuffled down the passageway and up to his heavy door. As far as Bayaz\ngoes, we are no further on. Nothing that will bring a rare smile to the face of his\nEminence. Summonings and sendings. Gods and devils. Always more questions.\nHe turned his key impatiently in the lock, desperate to sit down and take the weight\nfrom his trembling leg. What was Goyle doing at the university? Goyle, and Vitari,\nand two dozen Practicals, all armed as if they were going to war? He took a\nwincing step over the threshold. There must be some—\n'Gah!' He felt his cane snatched away and he lurched sideways, clutching at the\nair. Something crunched into his face and filled his head with blinding pain. The next\nmoment the floor thumped him in the back and drove his wind out in a long sigh. He\nblinked and slobbered, mouth salty with blood, the dark room swaying madly\naround him. Oh dear, oh dear. A fist in the face, unless I am much mistaken. It\nnever loses its impact.\nA hand grabbed the collar of his coat and dragged him up, the cloth cutting into\nhis throat and making him squawk like a strangled chicken.\nAnother had him by the belt and he was hauled bodily along, his knees and the\ntoes of his boots scraping limp over the boards. He struggled weakly on a reflex, but\nonly managed to send a stab of pain through his own back.\nThe bathroom door cracked against his head and banged open on the wall, he\nwas dragged powerless across the darkened room towards the bath, still full of dirty\nwater from that morning. 'Wait!' he croaked as he was wrestled over the edge. 'Who\nare—blurghhhh!'\nThe cold water closed around his head, the bubbles rushed around his face. He\nwas held there, struggling, eyes bulging open with shock and panic, until it seemed\nhis lungs would burst. Then he was yanked up by the hair, water pouring from his\nface and splattering into the bath. A simple technique, but undeniably effective. I am\ngreatly discomfited. He took in a gasping breath. 'What do you—blarghhh!'\nBack into the darkness, such air as he had managed to drag in gurgling out into\nthe dirty water. But whoever it is let me breathe. I am not being murdered. I am\nbeing softened up. Softened up for questions. I would laugh at the irony… were\nthere any breath… left in my body… He shoved at the bath and thrashed at the\nwater.

He was just sucking in a great lungful of\ndirty water as he was snatched up from the bath and flung onto the boards,\ncoughing, gasping, vomiting all at once.\n'You are Glokta?' A woman's voice, short and hard, with a rough Kantic accent.\nShe squatted down in front of him, balanced on the balls of her feet, her wrists\nresting on her knees, her long brown hands hanging limp. She wore a man's shirt,\nloose around her scrawny shoulders, wet sleeves rolled up around her bony wrists.\nHer black hair was hacked off short and stuck from her head in greasy clumps. She\nhad a thin, pale scar down her hard face, a scowl on her thin lips, but it was her eyes\nthat were most off-putting, gleaming yellow in the half light from the corridor. Small\nwonder that Severard was reluctant to follow her. I should have listened to him.\n'You are Glokta?'\nThere was no point denying it. He wiped the bitter drool from his chin with a\nshaking hand. 'I am Glokta.'\n'Why are you watching me?'\nHe pushed himself painfully up to sitting. 'What makes you think I will have\nanything to say to—'\nHer fist struck him on the point of his chin and snapped his head back, tore a\ngasp out of him. His jaws banged together and one tooth punched a hole in the\nbottom of his tongue. He sagged back against the wall, the dark room lurching, his\neyes filling up with tears. When things came back into focus she was staring at him,\nyellow eyes narrowed. 'I will keep hitting you until you give me answers, or you die.'\n'My thanks.'\n'Thanks?'\n'I think you might have loosened my neck up just a fraction.' Glokta smiled,\nshowing her his few bloody teeth. 'For two years I was a captive of the Gurkish.\nTwo years in the darkness of the Emperor's prisons. Two years of cutting, and\nchiselling, and burning. Do you think the thought of a slap or two scares me?' He\nchuckled bloody laughter in her face. 'It hurts more when I piss! Do you think I'm\nscared to die?' He grimaced at the stabbing through his spine as he leaned towards\nher. 'Every morning… that I wake up alive… is a disappointment! If you want\nanswers you'll have to give me answers. Like for like.'\nShe stared at him for a long moment, not blinking. 'You were a prisoner of the\nGurkish?'\nGlokta swept a hand over his twisted body. 'They gave me all this.'\n'Huh. We have both lost something to the Gurkish, then.' She slid down onto\ncrossed legs. 'Questions. Like for like. But if you try to lie to me—'\n'Questions, then. I would be failing in my duties as a host if I did not allow you to\ngo first.'\nShe did not smile.

'Bayaz said it is a weapon. A\nweapon of very great power. Great enough to turn Shaffa to dust. He thought it was\nhidden, at the edge of the World, but he was wrong. He was not happy to be\nwrong.' She frowned at him for a silent moment. 'Why are you watching Bayaz?'\n'Because he stole the crown and put it on a spineless worm.'\nShe snorted.

The handle of his cane. 'If\nyou have more business with Bayaz, leave me out of it. I will not be so gentle next\ntime.' She backed slowly towards the doorway, a bright rectangle against the\nshadowy wall. She turned, and the sound of her boots receded down the corridor.\nAside from the soft tip-tap of water dripping from his wet coat, all fell silent.\nAnd so, it seems, I survive. Again. Glokta raised his eyebrows. Perhaps the trick\nis not wanting to.\nThe Fourth Day\n« ^ »\nHe was an ugly bastard, this Easterner. A huge big one, dressed all in stinking,\nhalf-tanned furs and a bit of rusted chain-mail, more ornament than protection.\nGreasy black hair, bound up here and there with rough-forged silver rings, dripped\nwith the thin rain. He had a great scar down one cheek and another across his\nforehead, and the countless nicks and pittings of lesser wounds and boils as a lad,\nnose flattened and bent sideways like a dented spoon. His eyes were screwed up\ntight with effort, his yellow teeth were bared, the front two missing, his grey tongue\npressed into the gap. A face that had seen war all its days. A face that had lived by\nsword, and axe, and spear, and counted every day alive a bonus."

A face that had lived by\nsword, and axe, and spear, and counted every day alive a bonus.\nFor Logen, it was almost like looking in a mirror.\nThey held each other as tight as a pair of bad lovers, blind to everything around\nthem. They lumbered back and forward, lurching like feuding drunkards. They\nplucked and tugged, bit and gouged, gripped and tore, strained in frozen fury,\nblasting sour breath in each other's faces. An ugly, and a wearying, and a fatal dance,\nand all the while the rain came down.\nLogen took a painful dig in the gut and had to twist and wriggle to smother a\nsecond. He gave a half-hearted head-butt and did nothing more then scuff Ugly's\nface with his forehead. He nearly got tripped, stumbled, felt the Easterner shift his\nweight, trying to find a set to throw him. Logen managed to dig him in the fruits with\nhis thigh before he could do it, enough to make his arms go weak for a moment,\nenough so he could slide his hand up onto Ugly's neck.\nLogen forced that hand up, inch by painful inch, his stretched-out forefinger\ncreeping over the Easterner's pitted face while he peered down at it, cross-eyed,\ntrying to tip his head out of the way. His hand gripped painful tight round Logen's\nwrist, trying to haul it back, but Logen had his shoulder dipped, his weight set right.\nThe finger edged past his grimacing mouth, over his top lip, into Ugly's bent nose,\nand Logen felt his broken nail digging at the flesh inside. He crooked his finger, and\nbared his teeth, and twisted it about as best he could.\nThe Easterner hissed and thrashed around, but he was hooked. He'd no choice\nbut to grab at Logen's wrist with his other hand and try to drag that tearing finger out\nof his face. But that left Logen one hand free.\nHe snatched a knife out and grunted as he stabbed, his arm jerking in and out.\nQuick punches, but with steel on the end of them. The blade squelched in the\nEasterner's gut, and his thigh, and his arm, and his chest, blood coming out in long\nstreaks, splattering them both and trickling into the puddles under their boots. Once\nhe was stabbed enough Logen caught him by his coat, hauled him into the air with a\njaw-clenched effort, and roared as he flung him over the battlements. He plummeted\naway, limp as a carcass and soon to be one, crashed to the ground in among his\nfellows.\nLogen bent over the parapet, gasping at the wet air, the rain drops flitting down\naway from him. There were hundreds of them, it seemed like, milling around in the\nsea of mud at the base of the wall. Wild men, from out past the Crinna, where they\nhardly spoke right and cared nothing for the dead.

Their standards stood flapping in the rain behind them, bones and\nragged hides, ghostly shadows in the downpour.\nSome were carrying rickety ladders forwards, or lifting those that had been\nthrown down, trying to foot them near the wall and haul them up while rocks and\nspears and sodden arrows flapped and splattered into the mud. Others were\nclimbing, shields held over their heads, two ladders up at Dow's side, one on Red\nHat's side, one just to Logen's left. A pair of big savages were swinging great axes\nagainst the scarred gates, chopping wet splinters out with every blow. Logen pointed\nat them, screamed uselessly into the wet. No one heard him, or could have over the\ngreat noise of drumming rain, of crashing, thudding, scraping, blades on shields,\nshafts in flesh, battle cries and shrieks of pain.\nHe fumbled his sword up from the puddles on the walkway, dull metal glistening\nwith beads of water. Just near him one of Shivers' Carls was facing off against an\nEasterner who'd scrambled from the top of a ladder. They traded a couple of blows,\naxe against shield then sword swishing at the empty air. The Easterner's axe-arm\nwent up again and Logen hacked it off at the elbow, stumbled into his back and\nknocked him screaming on his face. The Carl finished him with a chop to the back\nof the skull, pointed his bloody sword over Logen's shoulder.\n'There!'\nAnother Easterner with a big hook nose just getting to the top of the ladder,\nleaning forward over the battlements, right arm going back with a spear ready. Logen\nbellowed as he came for him.\nHis eyes went wide and the spear wobbled, too late to throw. He tried to swing\nout of the way, clinging to the wet wood with his free hand, but only managed to\ndrag the ladder grating across the battlements. Logen's sword stabbed him under the\narm and he flailed back with a grunt, dropping his spear behind him. Logen stabbed\nat him again, slipped and lunged too far, near falling into his arms. Big-Nose clawed\nat him, trying to bundle him over the parapet. Logen smashed him in the face with\nthe pommel of his sword and knocked his head back, took some teeth out with a\nsecond blow. The third one knocked him senseless and he fell back off the ladder,\nplummeting down and taking one of his friends into the mud with him.\n'Bring that pole!' Logen roared at the Carl with the sword.\n'What?'\n'Pole, you fucker!'\nThe Carl snatched the wet length of wood up and threw it through the rain. Logen\ndropped his sword and wedged the branched end against one upright of the ladder,\nstarted pushing for all he was worth. The Carl came and added his weight to it, and\nthe ladder creaked, wobbled, and started tipping back. An Easterner's face came up\nover the battlements, surprised-looking. He saw the pole. He saw Logen and the Carl\ngrowling at it. He tumbled off as the ladder dropped away, down on the heads of the\nbastards below."

He tumbled off as the ladder dropped away, down on the heads of the\nbastards below.\nFurther along the wall another ladder had just been pushed back up and the\nEasterners were starting to climb it, shields up over their heads while Red Hat and\nhis boys chucked rocks at them. Some had got to the top over on Dow's bit of the\nwall, and he could hear the shouting from there, the sounds of murder. Logen\ngnawed at his bloody lip, wondering whether to push on down there and give them\nsome help, but he decided against. He'd be needed here before long.\nSo he took up the Maker's sword, and he nodded to the Carl who'd helped him,\nand he stood and caught his breath. He waited for the Easterners to come again, and\nall around him men fought, and killed, and died.\nDevils, in a cold, wet, bloody hell. Four days of it, now, and it felt as if he'd been\nthere forever. As if he'd never left. Perhaps he never had.\nLike the Dogman's life weren't difficult enough already, there had to be rain.\nWet was an archer's worst fear, alright. Apart from being ridden down by\nhorsemen, maybe, but that weren't so likely up a tower. The bows were slippery, the\nstrings were stretchy, the feathers were sodden, which all made for some ineffective\nshooting. Rain was costing them their advantage, and that was a worry, but it could\ncost them more than that before the day was out. There were three big wild bastards\nworking at the gates, two swinging heavy axes at the softened wood, the third trying\nto get a pry-bar in the gaps they'd made and tear the timbers apart.\n'If we don't deal with them, they'll have those gates in!' Dogman shouted hoarse\ninto the wet air.\n'Uh,' said Grim, nodding his head, water flicking off his shaggy thatch of hair.\nTook a good bit of bellowing and pointing from him and Tul, but Dogman got a\ncrowd of his lads lined up by the slick parapet. Three score wet bows, all lowered at\nonce, all drawn back creaking, all pointing down towards that gate. Three score men,\nfrowning and taking aim, all dripping with water and getting wetter every minute.\n'Alright then, loose!'\nThe bows went more or less together, the sounds muffled. The shafts spun\ndown, bouncing off the wet wall, sticking in the rough wood of the gate, prickling\nthe ground all round where the ditch used to be, before it became just another load\nof mud. Not what you'd call accurate, but there were a lot of shafts, and if you can't\nget quality, then numbers will have to do the job for you. The Easterner on the right\ndropped his axe, three arrows sticking out his chest, one through his leg. The one on\nthe left slipped and fell on his side, went floundering for cover, an arrow in his\nshoulder. The one with the bar went down on his knees, thrashing around and\ngrabbing behind him, trying to get at a shaft in the small of his back."

Good!' the Dogman shouted. None of the rest of 'em seemed keen to try\nthe gate for the moment, which was something to be grateful for. There were still\nplenty trying the ladders, but that was a harder task to deal with from up here. They\nmight just as easily shoot their own boys on the walls as the enemy in this weather.\nDogman gritted his teeth, and loosed a harmless, looping wet arrow down into the\nmilling crowd. Nothing they could do. The walls was Shivers job, and Dow's, and\nRed Hat's. The walls was Logen's job.\nThere was a crack, loud as the sky falling. The world went reeling bright, and soupy\nslow, sounds all echoing. Logen stumbled through this dream-place, the sword\nclattering out of his stupid fingers, lurched against the wall and grappled with it as it\nswayed around, trying to understand what had happened and not getting there.\nTwo men were struggling with each other over a spear, wrestling and jerking\nround and round, and Logen couldn't remember why. A man with long hair took a\ngreat slow blow with a club on his shield, a couple of splinters spinning, then he\nswept an axe round, teeth bared and shining, caught a wild-looking man in the legs\nand tore him off his feet. There were men everywhere, wet and furious, dirt and\nblood stained. A battle, maybe? Which side was he on?\nLogen felt something warm tickling his eye, and he touched his hand to it.\nFrowned down at his red finger tips, turning pink as the rain pattered on them.\nBlood. Had someone hit him on the head, then? Or was he dreaming it? A memory,\nfrom long ago.\nHe spun round just before the club came down and crushed his skull like an egg,\ncaught some hairy bastard's wrists with both hands. The world was suddenly fast,\nnoisy, pain pulsing in his head. He lurched against the parapet, staring into a dirty,\nbearded, angry face, pressed up tight against his.\nLogen let go the club with one hand, started snatching at his belt for a knife. He\ncouldn't feel one. All that time spent sharpening all those blades, and now he needed\none there was nothing to hand. Then he realised. The blade he was looking for was\nstuck in that ugly bastard, down in the mud somewhere at the base of the wall. He\nscrabbled round the other side of his belt, still wrestling at the club, but losing that\nbattle now, given that he only had the one hand to work with. Logen got bent back,\nslowly, over the battlements. His fingers found the grip of a knife. The hairy\nEasterner tore his club free and lifted it up, opening his mouth wide and giving a\nstinking yell.\nLogen stabbed him right through the face, and the blade went through one cheek\nand out the other and took a couple of teeth with it. Hairy's bellow turned to a\nhigh-pitched howl and he dropped his club and stumbled away, eyes bulging. Logen\nslid down and snatched his sword from under the trampling feet of the two fighting"

Logen\nslid down and snatched his sword from under the trampling feet of the two fighting\nover the spear, waited a moment for the Easterner to come round close to him, then\nchopped through the back of one thigh and brought him down with a scream where\nthe Carl could see to him.\nHairy was still drooling blood, one hand on the grip of the knife through his face,\ntrying to work it free. Logen's sword made a red gash through the wet furs on his\nside, brought him to his knees. The next swing split his head in half.\nNot ten strides away Shivers was in bad trouble, backed up with three Easterners\nat him, another just getting to the top of a ladder, and all his boys kept busy behind.\nHe winced as he took a hard blow from a hammer across his shield, stumbled back,\nhis axe dropping from his hand and clattering on the stone. The thought did pass\nthrough Logen's mind that he'd be a deal better off if Shivers got his head flattened.\nBut the odds were good that he'd be next.\nSo he took a great breath, and bellowed as he charged.\nThe first one turned just in time to get his face hacked open rather than the back\nof his skull. The second got his shield up, but Logen went low and chopped clean\nthrough his shin instead, sent him shrieking down on to his back, blood pumping out\ninto the pools of water across the walkway. The third one was a big bastard, wild\nred hair sticking all ways off his head. He had Shivers stunned and on his knees by\nthe parapet, his shield hanging down, blood running from a cut on his forehead. Red\nHair raised a big hammer up to finish the job. Logen stabbed him through the back\nbefore he got the chance, the long blade sliding through him right to the hilt. Never\ntake a man face to face if you can kill him from behind, Logen's father used to say,\nand that was one good piece of advice he'd always tried to follow. Red Hair\nthrashed and squealed, twisting madly with his last breaths, dragging Logen around\nafter him by the hilt of his sword, but it wasn't long before he dropped.\nLogen grabbed Shivers under the arm and hauled him up. He frowned hard as his\neyes came back into focus, saw who was helping him. He leaned down and snatched\nhis fallen axe up from the stones. Logen wondered for a moment if he was about to\nget it buried in his skull, but Shivers only stood there, blood running down his wet\nface from the cut across his head.\n'Behind you,' said Logen, nodding past his shoulder. Shivers turned, Logen did\nthe same, and they stood with their backs to each other. There were three or four\nladders up now, around the gate, and the battle on the walls had broken up into a\nfew separate, bloody little fights. There were Easterners clambering over the parapet,\nscreaming their meaningless jabber, hard faces and hard weapons glistening wet,\ncoming at Logen along the wall while more dragged themselves up.

He could only\ndeal with what was in front of him. You have to be realistic about these things.\nHe shuffled back, showing weariness that was only half-feigned, then as the first\nof them came on he gritted his teeth and leaped forward, cut him across the face and\nsent him screaming, hand clasped to his eyes. Logen stumbled into another and got\nbarged in the chest with a shield, its rim catching him under the chin and making him\nbite his tongue.\nLogen nearly tripped over the sprawled-out corpse of a dead Carl, righted himself\njust in time, flailed with his sword and hit nothing, reeled after it and felt something\ncut into his leg as he went. He gasped, and hopped, waving the sword around, all\noff-balance. He lunged at some moving fur, his leg gave under him and he piled into\nsomeone. They fell together and Logen's head cracked against the stone. They rolled\nand Logen struggled up on top, shouting and drooling, tangled his fingers in an\nEasterner's greasy hair and smashed his face into the stone, again and again until his\nskull went soft. He dragged himself away, heard a blade clang against the walkway\nwhere he'd been, hauled himself up to his knees, sword loose in one sticky hand.\nHe knelt there, water running down his face, dragging in air. More of them\ncoming at him, and nowhere to go. His leg was hurting, no strength in his arms. His\nhead felt light, like it might float away. No strength left to fight with, hardly. More of\nthem coming at him, one at the front with thick leather gloves, a big maul in his\nhands, its heavy spiked head red with blood. Looked like he'd already broken one\nskull with it, and Logen's would be next. Then Bethod would've won, at last.\nLogen felt a cold feeling stab at his gut. A hard, empty feeling. His knuckles\nclicked as the muscles in his hand went rigid, gripping the sword painful tight. 'No!'\nhe hissed. 'No, no, no.' But he might as well have said no to the rain. That cold\nfeeling spread out, up through Logen's face, tugging his mouth into a bloody smile.\nGloves came closer, his maul scraping against the wet stone. He glanced over his\nshoulder.\nHis head came apart, spraying out blood. Crummock-i-Phail roared like an angry\nbear, fingerbones flying round his neck, his great hammer whirling round and round\nhis head in huge circles. The next Easterner tried to back away, holding up his shield.\nCrummock's hammer swung two-handed, ripped his legs out from under him, sent\nhim tumbling over and over and onto his face on the stone. The big hillman sprang\nup onto the walkway, nimble as a dancer for all his great bulk, caught the next man a\nblow in the stomach that hurled him through the air and left him crumpled against the\nbattlements.\nLogen watched one set of savages murdering another, breathing hard as\nCrummock's boys whooped and screamed, paint on their faces smeared in the rain."

He bent over and breathed hard, his cold gut sucking in\nand out, his raw mouth salty, his nose full of the stink of blood. He hardly dared to\nlook up. He clenched his teeth, and closed his eyes, and hawked sour spit up onto\nthe stones. He forced that cold feeling in his stomach down and it slunk away, for\nnow, at least, and left him with only pain and weariness to worry about.\n'Looks like those bastards had enough,' came Crummock's laughing voice from\nout of the drizzle. The hillman tipped his head back, mouth open, stuck his tongue\nout into the rain, then licked his lips. 'That was some good work you put in today,\nBloody-Nine. Not that it ain't my special pleasure to watch you at it, but I'm glad to\nget my share.' He hefted his great long hammer up in one hand and spun it round as\nif it was a willow switch, peering at a great bloody stain on the head with a clump of\nhair stuck to it, then grinning wide.\nLogen looked up at him, hardly enough strength left to lift his head. 'Oh aye.\nGood work. We'll go at the back tomorrow though, eh, since you're that keen? You\ncan take the fucking wall.'\nThe rain was slacking, down to a thin spit and drizzle. A glimmer of fading sunlight\nbroke through the sagging clouds, bringing Bethod's camp back into view, his\nmuddy ditch and his standards, tents scattered across the valley. Dogman squinted,\nthought he could see a few men stood around the front watching the Easterners run\nback, a glint of sunlight on something. An eye-glass maybe, like the Union used,\nusually to look the wrong way. Dogman wondered if it was Bethod down there,\nwatching it all happen. It would be just like Bethod to have got himself an eye-glass.\nHe felt a big hand clap him on the shoulder. 'We gave 'em a slap, chief,' rumbled\nTul, 'and a good 'un!'\nThere was small doubt o' that. There were a lot of dead Easterners scattered in\nthe mud round the base of that wall, a lot of wounded carried by their mates, or\ndragging themselves slow and painful back towards their lines. But there were a fair\nfew killed on their side of the wall as well. Dogman could see a stack of muddy\ncorpses over near the back of the fortress where they were doing the burying. He\ncould hear someone screaming. Hard and nasty screams, the kind a man makes\nwhen he needs a limb taken off, or he's had one off already.\n'We gave 'em a slap, aye,' Dogman muttered, 'but they gave us one as well. I'm"

'Get what we can while we can!'\n'Can't have too many arrows at a time like this,' said Tul. 'Number o' those Crinna\nbastards we killed today, I reckon we'll have more spears tonight than we had this\nmorning.'\nDogman managed to put a grin on his face. 'Nice of 'em to bring us something to\nfight with.'\n'Aye. Reckon they'd get bored right quick if we ran out of arrows.' Tul laughed,\nand he clapped the Dogman on the back harder than ever, hard enough to make his\nteeth rattle. 'We did well! You did well! We're still alive, ain't we?'\n'Some of us are.' Dogman looked down at the corpse of the one man who'd died\nup on the tower. An old boy, hair mostly grey, a rough-made arrow in his neck. Bad\nluck, that had been, to catch a shaft on a day as wet as today, but you're sure to get\na measure of luck in a fight, both good and bad. He frowned down into the\ndarkening valley. 'Where the hell are the Union at?'\nAt least the rain had stopped. You have to be grateful for the small things in life, like\nsome smoky kind of a fire after the wet. You have to be grateful for the small things,\nwhen any minute might be your last.\nLogen sat alone beside his scrub of a flame, and rubbed gently at his right palm.\nIt was sore, pink, stiff from gripping the rough hilt of the Maker's sword all the long\nday, blistered round the joints of his fingers. His head was bruised all over. The cut\non his leg was burning some, but he could still walk well enough. He could've ended\nup a lot worse. There were more than three score buried now, and they were putting\nthem in pits for a dozen each, just as Crummock had said they would. Three score\nand more gone back to the mud, and twice that many hurt, a lot of them bad.\nOver by the big fire, he could hear Dow growling about how he'd stabbed some\nEasterner in the fruits. He could hear Tul's rumbling laughter. Logen hardly felt like a\npart of it, any more. Maybe he never had been. A set of men he'd fought and beaten.\nLives he'd spared, for no reason that made sense. Men who'd hated him worse than\ndeath, but been bound to follow. Hardly more his friends than Shivers was. Perhaps\nthe Dogman was his only true friend in all the wide Circle of the World, and even in\nhis eyes, from time to time, Logen thought he could see that old trace of doubt, that\nold trace of fear. He wondered if he could see it now, as the Dogman came up out\nof the darkness.\n'You think they'll come tonight?' he asked."

Logen grimaced as he stretched out his aching legs. 'It\nreally seems like this shit used to be easier.'\nDogman gave a snort. Not a laugh, really. More just letting Logen know he'd\nheard. 'Memory can work some magic. You remember Carleon?'\n'Course I do.' Logen looked down at his missing finger, and he bunched his fist,\nso it looked the same as it always had. 'Strange, how it all seemed so simple back in\nthem days. Who you fought for, and why. Can't say it ever bothered me.'\n'It bothered me,' said Dogman.\n'It did? You should've said something.'\n'Would you have listened?'\n'No. I guess not.'\nThey sat there for a minute, in silence.\n'You reckon we'll live through this?' asked the Dogman.\n'Maybe. If the Union turns up tomorrow, or the day after.'\n'You think they will?'\n'Maybe. We can hope.'\n'Hoping for a thing don't make it happen.'\n'The opposite, usually. But every day we're still alive is a chance. Maybe this time\nit'll work.'\nDogman frowned at the shifting flames. 'That's a lot of maybes.'\n'That's war.'\n'Who'd have thought we'd be relying on a bunch of Southerners to solve our\nproblems for us, eh?'\n'I reckon you solve 'em any way you can. You have to be realistic'\n'Being realistic, then. You reckon we'll live through this?'\nLogen thought about it for a while. 'Maybe.'\nBoots squelched in the soft earth, and Shivers walked up quiet towards the fire.\nThere was a grey bandage wrapped round his head, where he'd taken that cut, and\nhis hair hung down damp and greasy from under it.\n'Chief,' he said.\nDogman smiled as he got up, and clapped him on the shoulder. 'Alright, Shivers.\nThat was good work, today. I'm glad you came over, lad. We all are.' He gave\nLogen a long look. 'All of us. Think I might try and get a rest for a minute. I'll see\nyou boys when they come again. Most likely it'll be soon enough.' He walked off\ninto the night, and left Shivers and Logen staring one at the other.\nProbably Logen should have got his hand near to a knife, watched for sudden\nmoves and all the rest. But he was too tired and too sore for it. So he just sat there,\nand watched. Shivers pressed his lips together, squatting down beside the fire\nopposite, slow and reluctant, as if he was about to eat something he knew was\nrotten, but had no choice.\n'If I'd have been in your place,' he said, after a while, 'I would've let those\nbastards kill me today.'\n'Few years ago I'm sure I would've.'"

Then he shrugged his aching shoulders.\n'I'm trying to be better than I was.'\n'You think that's enough?'\n'What else can I do?'\nShivers frowned at the fire. 'I wanted to say…' He worked the words around in\nhis mouth and spat them out. 'That I'm grateful, I guess. You saved my life today. I\nknow it.' He wasn't happy about saying it, and Logen knew why. It's hard to be done\na favour by a man you hate. It's hard to hate him so much afterwards. Losing an\nenemy can be worse than losing a friend, if you've had him for long enough.\nSo Logen shrugged again. 'It's nothing. What a man should do for his crew,\nthat's all. I owe you a lot more. I know that. I can never pay what I owe you.'\n'No. But it's some kind o' start at it, far as I'm concerned.' Shivers got up and\ntook a step away. Then he stopped, and turned back, firelight shifting over one side\nof his hard, angry face. 'It ain't ever as simple, is it, as a man is just good or bad?\nNot even you. Not even Bethod. Not anybody.'\n'No.' Logen sat and watched the flames moving. 'No, it ain't ever that simple. We\nall got our reasons. Good men and bad men. It's all a matter of where you stand.'\nThe Perfect Couple\n« ^ »\nOne of Jezal's countless footmen perched on the stepladder, and lowered the crown\nwith frowning precision onto his head, its single enormous diamond flashing\npricelessly bright. He gave it the very slightest twist back and forth, the fur-trimmed\nrim gripping Jezal's skull. He climbed back down, whisked the stepladder away, and\nsurveyed the result. So did half a dozen of his fellows. One of them stepped forward\nto tweak the precise positioning of Jezal's gold-embroidered sleeve. Another\ngrimaced as he flicked an infinitesimal speck of dust from his pure white collar.\n'Very good,' said Bayaz, nodding thoughtfully to himself. 'I believe that you are\nready for your wedding.'\nThe peculiar thing, now that Jezal had a rare moment to think about it, was that he\nhad not, in any way of which he was aware, agreed to get married. He had neither\nproposed nor accepted a proposal. He had never actually said 'yes' to anything. And\nyet here he was, preparing to be joined in matrimony in a few short hours, and to a\nwoman he scarcely knew at all. It had not escaped his notice that in order to have\nbeen managed so quickly the arrangements must have been well underway before\nBayaz had even suggested the notion. Perhaps before Jezal had even been\ncrowned… but he supposed it was not so very surprising. Since his enthronement\nhe had drifted helplessly through one incomprehensible event after another, like a\nman shipwrecked and struggling to keep his head above water, out of sight of land,"

But considerably better\ndressed.\nHe was gradually starting to realise that the more powerful a man became, the\nfewer choices he really had. Captain Jezal dan Luthar had been able to eat what he\nliked, to sleep when he liked, to see who he liked. His August Majesty King Jezal the\nFirst, on the other hand, was bound by invisible chains of tradition, expectation, and\nresponsibility, that prescribed every aspect of his existence, however small.\nBayaz took a discerning step forward. 'Perhaps the top button undone here—'\nJezal jerked away with some annoyance. The attention of the Magus to every tiny\ndetail of his life was becoming more than tiresome. It seemed that he could scarcely\nuse the latrine without the old bastard poking through the results. 'I know how to\nbutton a coat!' he snapped. 'Should I expect to find you here tonight when I bring\nmy new wife to our bed-chamber, ready to instruct me on how best to use my\nprick?'\nThe footmen coughed, and averted their eyes, and scraped away towards the\ncorners of the room. Bayaz himself neither smiled nor frowned. 'I stand always\nready to advise your Majesty, but I had hoped that might be one item of business\nyou could manage alone.'\n'I hope you're well prepared for our little outing. I've been getting ready all morn—'\nArdee froze when she looked up and saw Glokta's face. 'What happened to you?'\n'What, this?' He waved his hand at the mottled mass of bruises. 'A Kantic woman\nbroke into my apartments in the night, punched me repeatedly and near drowned me\nin the bath.' An experience I would not recommend.\nEvidently she did not believe him. 'What really happened?'\n'I fell down the stairs.'\n'Ah. Stairs. They can be brutal bastards when you're not that firm on your feet.'\nShe stared at her half-full glass, her eyes slightly misty.\n'Are you drunk?'\n'It's the afternoon, isn't it? I try always to be drunk by now. Once you start a job\nyou should give it your best. Or so my father liked to tell me.'\nGlokta narrowed his eyes at her, and she stared back evenly over the rim of her\nglass. No trembling lip, no tragic face, no streaks of bitter tears down the cheek.\nShe seemed no less happy than usual. Or no more unhappy, perhaps. But Jezal\ndan Luthar's wedding day can be no joyous occasion for her. No one appreciates\nbeing jilted, whatever the circumstances. No one enjoys being abandoned.\n'We need not go, you know.' Glokta winced as he tried unsuccessfully to stretch\nsome movement into his wasted leg, and the wince itself caused a ripple of pain\nthrough his split lips and across his battered face. 'I certainly won't complain if I do\nnot have to walk another step today. We can sit here, and talk of rubbish and\npolitics.'\n'And miss the king's marriage?' gasped Ardee, one hand pressed to her chest in"

We can sit here, and talk of rubbish and\npolitics.'\n'And miss the king's marriage?' gasped Ardee, one hand pressed to her chest in\nfake horror. 'But I really must see what the Princess Terez is wearing! They say she\nis the most beautiful woman in the world, and even scum like me must have someone\nto look up to.' She tipped back her head and swilled down the last of her wine.\n'Having fucked the groom is really no excuse for missing a wedding, you know.'\nThe flagship of Grand Duke Orso of Talins ploughed slowly, deliberately,\nmajestically forwards, under no more than quarter sail, a host of seabirds flapping\nand calling in the rich blue sky above. It was by far the largest ship that Jezal, or\nanyone among the vast crowds that lined the quay and crammed the roofs and\nwindows of the buildings along the waterfront, had ever laid eyes upon.\nIt was decked out in its finest: coloured bunting fluttered from the rigging and its\nthree towering masts were hung with bright flags, the sable cross of Talins and the\ngolden sun of the Union, side by side in honour of the happy occasion. But it looked\nno less menacing for that. It looked as Logen Ninefingers might have in a dandy's\njacket. Unmistakably still a man of war, and appearing more savage rather than less\nfor the gaudy finery in which it was plainly uncomfortable. As the means of bringing\na single woman to Adua, and that woman Jezal's bride-to-be, this mighty vessel was\nanything but reassuring. It implied that Grand Duke Orso might be an intimidating\npresence as a father-in-law.\nJezal saw sailors now, crawling among the myriad ropes like ants through a bush,\nbringing the acres of sailcloth in with well-practised speed. They let the mighty ship\nplough forward under its own momentum, its vast shadow falling over the quay and\nplunging half the welcoming party into darkness. It slowed, the air full of the creaking\nof timbers and hawsers. It came to a deliberate stop, dwarfing the now tiny-seeming\nboats meekly tethered to either side as a tiger might dwarf kittens. The golden\nfigurehead, a woman twice life-size thrusting a spear towards the heavens, glittered\nmenacingly far over Jezal's head.\nA huge wharf had been specially constructed in the middle of the quay where the\ndraught was at its deepest. Down this gently sloping ramp the royal party of Talins\ndescended into Adua, like visitors from a distant star where everyone was rich,\nbeautiful, and obliviously happy.\nTo either side marched a row of bearded guardsmen, all dressed in identical\nblack uniforms, their helmets polished to a painful pitch of mirror brightness.\nBetween them, in two rows of six, came a dozen ladies-in-waiting, each one arrayed\nin red, or blue, or vivid purple silks, each one as splendid as a queen herself.\nBut not one of the awestruck multitude on the waterfront could have been in any\ndoubt who was the centre of attention.

        "text": "doubt who was the centre of attention. The Princess Terez glided along at the fore:\ntall, slender, impossibly regal, as graceful as a circus dancer and as stately as an\nEmpress of legend. Her pure white gown was stitched with glittering gold, her\nshimmering hair was the colour of polished bronze, a chain of daunting diamonds\nflashed and sparkled on her pale chest in the bright sunlight. The Jewel of Talins\nseemed at that moment an apt name indeed. Terez looked as pure and dazzling, as\nproud and brilliant, as hard and beautiful as a flawless gemstone.\nAs her feet touched the stones the crowds burst out into a tumultuous cheer, and\nflower petals began to fall in well-orchestrated cascades from the windows of the\nbuildings high above. So it was that she advanced on Jezal with magnificent dignity,\nher head held imperiously high, her hands clasped proudly before her, over a soft\ncarpet and through a sweet-smelling haze of fluttering pink and red.\nTo call it a breathtaking entrance would have been understatement of an epic\norder.\n'Your August Majesty,' she murmured, somehow managing to make him feel like\nthe humble one as she curtsied, and behind her the ladies followed suit, and the\nguardsmen bowed low, all with impeccable coordination. 'My father, the Grand\nDuke Orso of Talins, sends his profound apologies,' and she rose up perfectly erect\nagain as though hoisted by invisible strings, 'but urgent business in Styria prevents\nhim from attending our wedding.'\n'You are all we need,' croaked Jezal, cursing silently a moment later as he realised\nhe had completely ignored the proper form of address. It was somewhat difficult to\nthink clearly, under the circumstances. Terez was even more breathtaking now than\nwhen he had last seen her, a year or more ago, arguing savagely with Prince Ladisla\nat the feast held in his honour. The memory of her vicious shrieking did little to\nencourage him, but then Jezal would hardly have been delighted by the prospect of\nmarrying Ladisla himself. After all, the man had been a complete ass. Jezal was an\nentirely different sort of person and could no doubt expect a different response. So\nhe hoped.\n'Please, your Highness,' and he held out his hand to her. She rested hers on it,\nseeming to weigh less than a feather.\n'Your Majesty does me too much honour.'\nThe hooves of the grey horses crackled on the paving, the carriage-wheels\nwhirred smoothly. They set off up the Kingsway, a company of Knights of the Body\nriding in tight formation around them, arms and armour glinting, each stride of the\ngreat thoroughfare lined with appreciative commoners, each door and window filled\nwith smiling subjects. All there to cheer for their new king, and for the woman soon\nto be their queen.\nJezal knew he must look an utter idiot next to her. A clumsy, lowborn,\nill-mannered oaf, who had not the slightest right to share her carriage, unless,\nperhaps, she was using him as a footrest. He had never in his life felt truly inferior\nbefore. He could scarcely believe that he was marrying this woman. Today. His\nhands were shaking. Positively shaking. Perhaps some heartfelt words might help"

Perhaps some heartfelt words might help\nthem both relax.\n'Terez…' She continued to wave imperiously to the crowds. 'I realise… that we\ndo not know each other in the least, but… I would like to know you.' The slightest\ntwitch of her mouth was the only sign that she had heard him. 'I know that this must\nhave come as a terrible shock to you, just as it has to me. I hope, if there is anything\nI can do… to make it easier, that—'\n'My father feels the interests of my country are best served by this marriage, and\nit is a daughter's place to obey. Those of us born to high station are long prepared to\nmake sacrifices.'\nHer perfect head turned smoothly on her perfect neck, and she smiled. A smile\nslightly forced, perhaps, but no less radiant for that. It was hard to believe that a face\nso smooth and flawless could be made of meat, like everybody else's. It seemed like\nporcelain, or polished stone. It was a constant, magical delight to see it move. He\nwondered if her lips were cool or warm. He would have liked very much to find out.\nShe leaned close to him, and placed her hand gently on the back of his. Warm,\nundoubtedly warm, and soft, and very much made of flesh. 'You really should\nwave,' she murmured, her voice full of Styrian song.\n'Er, yes,' he croaked, his mouth very dry, 'yes, of course.'\nGlokta stood, Ardee beside him, and frowned at the doors of the Lords' Round.\nBeyond those towering gates, in the great circular hall, the ceremony was taking\nplace. Oh, joyous, joyous day! High Justice Marovia's wise exhortations would be\nechoing from the gilded dome, the happy couple would be speaking their solemn\nvows with light hearts. Only the lucky few had been allowed within to bear witness.\nThe rest of us must worship from afar. And quite a crowd had gathered to do just\nthat. The wide Square of Marshals was choked with them. Glokta's ears were stuffed\nwith their excited babbling. A sycophantic throng, all eager for their divine\nMajesties to emerge.\nHe rocked impatiently back and forth, from side to side, grimacing and hissing,\ntrying to get the blood to flow in his aching legs, the cramps to be still. But standing\nin one place for this length of time is, to put it simply, torture.\n'How long can a wedding take?'\nArdee raised one dark eyebrow. 'Perhaps they couldn't keep their hands off each\nother, and are busy consummating the marriage right there on the floor of the Lords'\nRound.'\n'How bloody long can a consummation take?'\n'Lean on me if you need to,' she said, holding out her elbow to him.\n'The cripple using the drunk for support?' Glokta frowned. 'We make quite the\ncouple.'\n'Fall over if you prefer, and knock out the rest of your teeth. I'll lose no sleep\nover it.'\nPerhaps I should take her up on the offer, if only for a moment. After all,"

After all,\nwhere's the harm? But then the first shrill cheers began to float up, soon joined by\nmore and more until a jubilant roar was making the air throb. The doors of the\nLords' Round were finally being heaved open, and the High King and Queen of the\nUnion emerged into the bright sunlight, hand in hand.\nEven Glokta was forced to admit that they made a dazzling pair. Like monarchs\nof myth they stood arrayed in brilliant white, trimmed with twinkling embroidery,\nmatching golden suns across the back of her long gown and his long coat, glittering\nas they turned to the crowds. Each tall, and slender, and graceful, each crowned with\nshining gold and a single flashing diamond. Both so very young, and so very\nbeautiful, and with all their happy, rich, and powerful lives ahead of them.\nHurrah! Hurrah for them! My shrivelled turd of a heart bursts open with joy!\nGlokta rested his hand on Ardee's elbow, and he leaned towards her, and he\nsmiled his most twisted, toothless, grotesque grin. 'Is it really true that our King is\nmore handsome than I?'\n'Offensive nonsense!' She thrust out her chest and tossed her head, giving Glokta\na withering sneer down her nose. 'And I sparkle more brightly than the Jewel of\nTalins!'\n'Oh, you do, my dear, you absolutely do. We make them look like beggars!'\n'Like scum.'\n'Like cripples.'\nThey chuckled together as the royal pair swept majestically across the square,\naccompanied by a score of watchful Knights of the Body. The Closed Council\nfollowed behind at a respectful distance, eleven stately old men with Bayaz among\nthem in his arcane vestments, smiling almost as wide as the glorious couple\nthemselves.\n'I didn't even like him,' muttered Ardee under her breath, 'to begin with. Not\nreally.' That certainly makes two of us.\n'No need to weep. You're far too sharp to have been satisfied with a dullard like\nhim.'\nShe breathed in sharply. 'I'm sure you're right. But I was so bored, and lonely,\nand tired.' And drunk, no doubt. She shrugged her shoulders hopelessly. 'He made\nme feel like I was something more than a burden. He made me feel… wanted.'\nAnd what makes you suppose that I want to know about it? 'Wanted, you say?\nHow wonderful. And now?'\nShe looked miserably down at the ground, and Glokta felt just the smallest trace\nof guilt. But guilt only really hurts when there's nothing else to worry about.\n'It was hardly as if it was true love.' He saw the thin sinews in her neck moving as\nshe swallowed. 'But somehow I always thought it would be me making a fool of\nhim.'\n'Huh.' How rarely any of us get what we expect.\nThe royal party processed gradually out of view, the last splendid courtiers and\nshining bodyguards tramping after them, the sound of rapturous applause creeping\noff towards the palace.

Towards their glorious futures, and we guilty secrets are by\nno means invited.\n'Here we stand,' murmured Ardee. 'The off-cuts.'\n'The wretched leavings.'\n'The rotten stalks.'\n'I wouldn't worry over much.' Glokta gave a sigh. 'You are still young, clever,\nand passably pretty.'\n'Epic praise indeed.'\n'You have all your teeth and both your legs. A marked advantage over some of\nus. I do not doubt that you will soon find some other highborn idiot to entrap, and\nno harm done.'\nShe turned away from him, and hunched her shoulders, and he guessed that she\nwas biting her lip. He winced, and lifted his hand to lay it on her shoulder… The\nsame hand that cut Sepp dan Teufels fingers into slices, that pinched the nipples\nfrom Inquisitor Harker's chest, that carved one Gurkish emissary into pieces and\nburned another, that sent innocent men to rot in Angland, and so on, and so on…\nHe jerked it back, and let it fall. Better to cry all the tears in the world than be\ntouched by that hand. Comfort comes from other sources, and flows to other\ndestinations. He frowned out across the square, and left Ardee to her misery.\nThe crowd cheered on.\nIt was a magnificent event, of course. No effort or expense had been spared. Jezal\nwould not have been at all surprised if he had five hundred guests, and no more than\na dozen of them known to himself in any significant degree. The Lords and Ladies\nof the Union. The great men of Closed and Open Councils. The richest and the most\npowerful, dressed in their best and on their best behaviour.\nThe Chamber of Mirrors was a fitting venue. The most spectacular room in the\nentire palace, as big as a battlefield and made to seem larger yet by the great mirrors\nwhich covered every wall, creating the disconcerting impression of dozens of other\nmagnificent weddings, in dozens of other adjoining ballrooms. A multitude of\ncandles flickered and waved on the tables, and in the sconces, and among the crystal\nchandeliers high above. Their soft light shone on the silverware, glittered on the\njewels of the guests, and was reflected back from the dark walls, gleaming into the\nfar, dim distance: a million points of light, like the stars in a dark night sky. A dozen\nof the Union's finest musicians played subtle and entrancing music, and it mingled\nwith the swell of satisfied chatter, the clink and rattle of old money and new cutlery.\nIt was a joyous celebration. The evening of a lifetime. For the guests.\nFor Jezal it was something else, and he was not sure what. He sat at a gilded table\nwith his queen beside him, the two of them outnumbered ten to one by fawning\nservants, displayed to the full view of the whole assembly as though they were a pair\nof prize exhibits in a zoo.

Jezal sat in a haze of awkwardness, in a dreamlike silence,\nstartling from time to time like a sick rabbit as a powdered footman blindsided him\nwith vegetables. Terez sat on his right, occasionally spearing the slightest morsel with\na discerning fork, lifting it, chewing it, swallowing it with elegant precision. Jezal had\nnever thought that it was possible to eat beautifully. He now realised his mistake.\nHe could scarcely remember the ringing words of the High Justice that had, he\nsupposed, bound the two of them irrevocably together. Something about love and\nthe security of the nation, he vaguely recalled. But he could see the ring that he had\nhanded numbly to Terez in the Lords' Round, its enormous blood-red stone\nglittering on her long middle finger. He chewed at a slice of the finest meat, and it\ntasted like mud in his mouth. They were man and wife.\nHe saw now that Bayaz had been right, as always. The people longed for\nsomething effortlessly higher than themselves. They might not all have had the king\nthey would have asked for, but no one could possibly deny that Terez was all a\nqueen should be and more. The mere idea of Ardee West sitting in that gilded chair\nwas absurd. And yet Jezal felt a pang of guilt when the idea occurred, closely\nfollowed by a greater one of sadness. It would have been a comfort to have\nsomeone to talk to, then. He gave a painful sigh. If he was to spend his life with this\nwoman, they would have to speak. The sooner they began, he supposed, the better.\n'I hear that Talins… is a most beautiful city.'\n'Indeed,' she said with careful formality, 'but Adua has its sights also.' She\npaused, and looked down unhopefully at her plate.\nJezal cleared his throat. 'This is somewhat… difficult to adjust to.' He ventured a\nfraction of a smile.\nShe blinked, and looked out at the room. 'It is.'\n'Do you dance?'\nShe turned her head smoothly to look at him without the slightest apparent\nmovement of her shoulders. 'A little.'\nHe pushed back his chair and stood up. 'Then shall we, your Majesty?'\n'As you wish, your Majesty.'\nAs they made their way towards the middle of the wide floor, the chatter\ngradually diminished. The Chamber of Mirrors grew deathly quiet aside from the\nclicking of his polished boots, and her polished shoes, on the glistening stone. Jezal\nswallowed as they took their places, surrounded on three sides by the long tables,\nand the legions of magnificent guests, all watching. He had rather that same feeling of\nbreathless anticipation, of fear and excitement, that he had used to have when he\nstepped into the fencing circle against an unknown opponent, before the roaring\ncrowd.\nThey stood still as statues, looking into each other's eyes. He held out his hand,\npalm up. She reached out, but instead of taking it she pressed the back of her hand\nfirmly against the back of his and pushed it up so that their fingers were level.

A silent challenge, that no one else in the\nhall could possibly have seen.\nThe first long drawn-out note sobbed from the strings and echoed around the\nchamber. They set off, circling each other with exaggerated slowness, the golden\nhem of Terez' dress swishing across the floor, her feet out of sight so that she\nappeared to glide rather than take steps, her chin held painfully high. They moved\nfirst one way and then the other, and in the mirrors around them a thousand other\ncouples moved in time, stretching away into the shadowy distance, crowned and\ndressed in flawless white and gold.\nAs the second phrase began, and other instruments joined in, Jezal began to\nrealise that he was utterly outclassed, worse than ever he had been by Bremer dan\nGorst. Terez moved with such immaculate poise that he was sure she could have\nbalanced a glass of wine on her head without spilling a drop. The music grew louder,\nfaster, bolder, and Terez' movements came faster and bolder with it. It seemed as if\nshe somehow controlled the musicians with her outstretched hands, the two were\nlinked so perfectly. He tried to steer her and she stepped effortlessly around him.\nShe feinted one way and whirled the other and Jezal almost went over on his arse.\nShe dodged and spun with masterful disguise and left him lunging at nothing.\nThe music grew faster yet, the musicians sawed and plucked with furious\nconcentration. Jezal made a vain attempt to catch her but Terez twisted away,\ndazzling him with a flurry of skirts that he could barely follow. She almost tripped\nhim with a foot which was gone before he knew it, tossed her head and almost\nstabbed him in the eye with her crown. The great and good of the Union looked on\nin enchanted silence. Even Jezal found himself a dumbstruck spectator. It was the\nmost he could do to remain in roughly the right positions to be made an utter fool of.\nHe was not sure whether he was relieved or disappointed when the music slowed\nagain and she offered out her hand as though it were a rare treasure. He pressed the\nback of his against it and they circled each other, drawing closer and closer. As the\nlast refrain wept from the instruments she pressed herself against him, her back to his\nchest.\nSlowly they turned, and slower still, his nose full of the smell of her hair. At the\nlast long note she sank back and he lowered her gently, her neck stretching out, her\nhead dropping, her delicate crown almost brushing the floor. And there was silence.\nThe room broke into rapturous applause, but Jezal hardly heard them. He was\ntoo busy staring at his wife. There was a faint colour to her cheek now, her lips\nslightly parted exposing flawless front teeth, and the lines of her jaw, and\nstretched-out neck, and slender collar-bones were etched with shadow and ringed\nwith sparkling diamonds. Lower down her chest rose and fell imperiously in her\nbodice with her rapid breathing, the slightest, fascinating sheen of sweat nestling in\nher cleavage. Jezal would have very much liked to nestle there himself. He blinked,\nhis own breath sharp in his throat.\n'If it please your Majesty,' she murmured."

He whisked her back to her feet as the applause continued.\n'You dance… magnificently.'\n'Your Majesty is too kind,' she replied, with the barest fragment of a smile, but a\nsmile nonetheless. He beamed gormlessly back at her. His fear and confusion had, in\nthe space of a single dance, smoothly transformed into a most pleasurable\nexcitement. He had been gifted a glimpse beneath the icy shell, and plainly his new\nQueen was a woman of rare and fiery passion. A hidden side to her that he was now\ngreatly looking forward to investigating further. Looking forward so sharply, in fact,\nthat he was forced to avert his eyes and stare off into the corner, frowning and trying\ndesperately to think of other things, lest the tightness of his trousers caused him to\nembarrass himself in front of the assembled guests.\nThe sight of Bayaz grinning in the corner was for once just what he needed to\nsee, the old man's cold smile cooling his ardour as surely as a bucket of iced water.\nGlokta had left Ardee in her over-furnished living room making every effort to get\neven more drunk, and ever since he had found himself in a black mood. Even for\nme. There's nothing like the company of someone even more wretched than\nyourself to make you feel better. Trouble is, take their misery away and your own\npresses in twice as cold and dreary behind it.\nHe slurped another half mouthful of gritty soup from his spoon, grimaced as he\nforced the over-salty slop down his throat. I wonder how wonderful a time King\nJezal is enjoying now? Lauded and admired by all, gorging himself on the best\nfood and the best company. He dropped the spoon into the bowl, his left eye\ntwitching, and winced at a ripple of pain through his back and down into his leg.\nEight years since the Gurkish released me, yet I am still their prisoner, and always\nwill be. Trapped in a cell no bigger than my own crippled body.\nThe door creaked open and Barnam shuffled in to collect the bowl. Glokta\nlooked from the half-dead soup to the half-dead old man. The best food, and the\nbest company. He would have laughed if his split lips had allowed it.\n'Finished, sir?' asked the servant.\n'More than likely.' I have been unable to pull the means of destroying Bayaz out\nof my arse, and so, of course, his Eminence will not be pleased. How displeased\ncan he get, do we suppose, before he loses patience entirely? But what can be\ndone?\nBarnam carried the bowl from the room, pulled the door shut behind him, and left\nGlokta alone with his pain. What is it that I did to deserve this? And what is it that\nLuthar did? Is he not just as I was? Arrogant, vain, and selfish as hell? Is he a\nbetter man? Then why has life punished me so harshly, and rewarded him so\nrichly?"

The same reason that innocent Sepp dan\nTeufel languishes in Angland with his fingers shortened. The same reason that\nloyal General Vissbruck died in Dagoska, while treacherous Magister Eider was\nlet live. The same reason that Tulkis, the Gurkish Ambassador, was butchered in\nfront of a howling crowd for a crime he did not commit.\nHe pressed his sore tongue into one of his few remaining teeth. Life is not fair.\nJezal pranced down the hallway in a dream, but no longer the panicked nightmare of\nthe morning. His head was spinning from praise, and applause, and approval. His\nbody was glowing with dancing, and wine, and, increasingly, lust. With Terez beside\nhim, for the first time in his brief reign, he truly felt like a king. Gems and metal, silk\nand embroidery, and pale, smooth skin all shone excitingly in the soft candlelight.\nThe evening had turned out to be a delight, and the night promised only to be better\nyet. Terez might have seemed as hard as a jewel from a distance, but Jezal had held\nher in his arms, and he knew better.\nThe great panelled doors of the royal bedchamber were held open by a pair of\ncringing footmen, then shut silently as the King and Queen of the Union swept past.\nThe mighty bed dominated the far side of the room, sprays of tall feathers at the\ncorners of its canopy casting long shadows up onto the gilded ceiling. Its rich green\ncurtains hung invitingly wide, the silken space beyond filled with soft and tantalising\nshadows.\nTerez took a few slow steps into the chamber ahead of him, her head bowed,\nwhile Jezal turned the key in the lock with a long, smooth rattling of wards. His\nbreath came fast as he stepped up behind his wife, lifted his hand and placed it\ngently on her bare shoulder. He felt the muscles stiffen under her smooth skin,\nsmiled at her nervousness, matching his own so closely. He wondered if he should\nsay something to try and calm her, but what would have been the purpose? They\nboth knew what had to happen now, and Jezal for one was impatient to begin.\nHe came closer, slipping his free hand around her waist, feeling his palm hiss\nover rough silk. He brushed the nape of her neck with his lips, once, twice, three\ntimes. He nuzzled against her hair, dragging in her fragrance and breathing it out\nsoftly against the side of her face. He felt her tremble at his breath upon her skin, but\nthat only encouraged him. He slid his ringers over her shoulder and across her chest,\nher diamonds trailing over the back of his hand as he slipped it down into her\nbodice. He moved up closer yet, pressing himself against her, making a satisfied\ngrowl in his throat, his prick nudging pleasantly into her backside through their\nclothes—\nIn a moment she had torn away from him with a gasp, spun around and slapped"

'You filthy bastard!' she\nshrieked in his face, spit flying from her twisted mouth. 'You son of a fucking\nwhore! How dare you touch me? Ladisla was a cretin, but at least his blood was\nclean!'\nJezal gaped, one hand pressed against his burning face, his whole body rigid with\nshock. He reached out feebly with his other hand. 'But I—ooof!'\nHer knee caught him between the legs with pitiless accuracy, driving the wind\nfrom his chest, making him teeter for a breathless moment, then bringing him down\nlike a sledgehammer to a house of cards. As he slid groaning to the carpet in that\nspecial, shooting agony that only a blow to the fruits can produce, it was little\nconsolation that he had been right.\nHis Queen was quite evidently a woman of rare and fiery passion.\nThe tears flowing so liberally from his eyes were not just of pain, and awful\nsurprise, and temporary disappointment, they were, increasingly, of deepening\nhorror. It seemed that he had misjudged Terez' feelings most seriously. She had\nsmiled for the crowds, but now, in private, she gave every indication of despising\nhim and all he stood for. The fact that he had been born a bastard was hardly\nsomething he could ever change. For all he knew his wedding night was about to be\nspent on the royal floor. The queen had already hurried across the room, and the\ncurtains of the bed were tightly drawn against him.\nThe Seventh Day\n« ^ »\nThe Easterners had come again last night. Crept up by darkness, found a spot to\nclimb in and killed a sentry. Then they'd set a ladder and a crowd of 'em had\nsneaked inside by the time they were found out. The cries had woken the Dogman,\nhardly sleeping anyway, and he'd scrabbled awake in the black, all tangled with his\nblanket. Enemies inside the fortress, men running and shouting, shadows in the dark,\neverything reeking of panic and chaos. Men fighting by starlight, and by torchlight,\nand by no light at all, blades swung with hardly a notion of where they were headed,\nboots stumbling and kicking showers of bright sparks out of the guttering campfires.\nThey'd driven 'em back in the end. They'd herded them to the wall, and cut them\ndown in numbers, and only three had lived to drop their weapons and give up. A\nbad mistake for them, as it turned out. There were a lot of men dead, these seven\ndays. Every time the sun went down there were more graves. No one was in much of\na merciful mood, providing they'd been suited that way in the first place, and not\nmany had. So when they'd caught these three, Black Dow had trussed 'em up on the\nwall where Bethod and all the rest could see. Trussed 'em up in the hard blue dawn,\nfirst streaks of light just stabbing across the black sky, and he'd doused them all with"

Trussed 'em up in the hard blue dawn,\nfirst streaks of light just stabbing across the black sky, and he'd doused them all with\noil and set a spark to them. One by one he'd done it. So the others could see what\nwas coming and set to screaming before their turn.\nDogman didn't much take to seeing men on fire. He didn't like hearing their\nshrieks and their fat crackling. He didn't smile at a nose-full of the sick-sweet stink of\ntheir burning meat. But he didn't think of trying to stop it neither. There was a time\nfor soft opinions, and this weren't it. Mercy and weakness are the same thing in war,\nand there's no prizes for nice behaviour. He'd learned that from Bethod, a long time\nago. Maybe now those Easterners would give it a second thought before they came\nagain at night and fucked up everyone's breakfast.\nMight help to put some steel in the rest of the Dogman's crew besides, because\nmore than a few were getting itchy. Some lads had tried to get away two nights\nbefore. Given up their places and crept over the wall in the darkness, tried to get\ndown into the valley. Bethod had their heads on spears out in front of his ditch now.\nA dozen battered lumps, hair blowing about in the breeze. You could hardly see their\nfaces from the wall, but it seemed somehow they had an angry, upset sort of a look.\nLike they blamed the Dogman for leading them to this. As though he hadn't enough\nto worry about with the reproaches of the living.\nHe frowned down at Bethod's camp, the shapes of his tents and his signs just\nstarting to come up black out of the mist and the darkness, and he wondered what\nhe could do, except for stand there, and wait. All his boys were looking to him,\nhoping he'd pull some trick of magic to get them out of this alive. But Dogman didn't\nknow any magic. A valley, and a wall, and no ways out. No ways out had been the\nwhole point of the plan. He wondered if they could stand another day. But then he'd\nwondered that yesterday morning.\n'What's Bethod planning for today, do we reckon?' he murmured to himself.\n'What's he got planned?'\n'A massacre?' grunted Grim.\nDogman gave him a hard look. 'Attack is the word I might've picked, but I\nwouldn't be surprised if we get it your way, before the day's out.' He narrowed his\neyes and stared down into the shadowy valley, hoping to see what he'd been hoping\nfor all the last seven long days. Some sign that the Union were coming. But there\nwas nothing. Below Bethod's wide camp, his tents, and his standards, and his\nmasses of men, there was nothing but the bare and empty land, mist clinging in the\nshady hollows.\nTul nudged him in the ribs with a great big elbow, and managed to make a grin. 'I\ndon't know about this plan. Waiting for the Union, and all that. Sounds a bit risky, if\nyou ask me. Any chance I can change my mind now?'\nThe Dogman didn't laugh. He hadn't any laughter left. 'Not much.'"

'I don't suppose there is.'\nSeven days, since the Shanka first came at the walls. Seven days, and it felt like\nseven months. Logen hardly had a muscle that didn't ache from hard use. He was\ncovered in a legion of bruises, a host of scratches, an army of grazes, and knocks,\nand burns. He had the long cut down his leg bandaged, his ribs all bound up tight\nfrom getting kicked in them, a pair of good-sized scabs under his hair, his shoulder\nstiff as wood from where he'd got battered with a shield, his knuckles scraped and\nswollen from punching at an Easterner and catching stone instead. He was one\nenormous sore spot.\nThe rest of the crowd were little better off. There was hardly a man in the whole\nfortress without some kind of an injury. Even Crummock's daughter had picked up a\nscratch from somewhere. One of Shivers' boys had lost himself a finger the day\nbefore yesterday. Little one, on his left hand. He was looking at it now, wrapped up\ntight in dirty, bloody cloth, wincing.\n'Burns, don't it?' he said, looking up at Logen, bunching up the rest of his fingers\nand opening them again.\nLogen should've felt sorry for him, probably. He remembered the pain, and the\ndisappointment even worse. Hardly able to believe that you wouldn't have that finger\nany more, for the whole rest of your life. But he'd got no pity left for anyone beyond\nhimself. 'It surely does,' he grunted.\n'Feels like it's still there.'\n'Aye.'\n'Does that feeling go away?'\n'In time.'\n'How much time?'\n'More than we've got, most likely.'\nThe man nodded, slow and grim. 'Aye.'\nSeven days, and even the cold stone and wet wood of the fortress itself seemed\nto have had enough. The new parapets were crumbled and sagging, shored up as\nbest they could be, and crumbled again. The gates were chopped to rotten firewood,\ndaylight showing through the hacked-out gaps, boulders piled in behind. A firm\nknock might have brought them down. A firm knock might have brought Logen\ndown, for that matter, the way he was feeling.\nHe took a mouthful of sour water from his flask. They were getting to the rank\nstuff at the bottom of the barrels. Low on food too, and on everything else. Hope, in\nparticular, was in short and dwindling supply. 'Still alive,' he whispered to himself,\nbut there wasn't much triumph in it. Even less than usual. Civilisation might not have\nbeen all to his taste, but a soft bed, a strange place to piss, and a bit of scorn from\nsome skinny idiots didn't seem like such a bad option right then. He was busy asking\nhimself for the thousandth time why he came back at all when he heard\nCrummock-i-Phail's voice behind him.\n'Well, well, Bloody-Nine. You look tired, man.'"

The hillman's mad blather was starting to grate on him. 'It's\nbeen hard work these past days, in case you hadn't noticed.'\n'I have, and I've had my part in it, haven't I, my beauties?' His three children\nlooked at each other.\n'Aye?' said the girl in a tiny voice.\nCrummock frowned down at them. 'Don't like the way the game's played no\nmore, eh? How about you, Bloody-Nine? The moon stopped smiling, has it? You\nscared, are you?'\nLogen gave the fat bastard a long, hard look. 'Tired is what I am, Crummock.\nTired o' your fortress, your food, and most of all I'm tired of your fucking talk. Not\neveryone loves the sound o' your fat lips flapping as much as you. Why don't you\npiss off and see if you can fit the moon up your arse.'\nCrummock split a grin, a curve of yellow teeth standing out from his brown\nbeard. 'That's the man I love, right there.' One of his sons, the one that carried the\nspear with him, was tugging at his shirt. 'What the hell is it, boy?'\n'What happens if we lose, Da?'\n'If we what?' growled Crummock, and he cuffed his son round the head with a\ngreat hand and knocked him on his face in the dirt. 'On your feet! There'll be no\nlosing here, boy!'\n'Not while the moon loves us,' muttered his sister, but not that loud.\nLogen watched the lad struggling up, holding a hand to his bloody mouth and\nlooking like he wanted to cry. He knew that feeling. Probably he should've said\nsomething about treating a child that way. Maybe he would've, on the first day, or\nthe second even. Not now. He was too tired, and too sore, and too scared to care\nmuch about it.\nBlack Dow ambled up, something not too far from a smile across his face. The\none man in the whole camp who might've been said to be in a better mood than\nusual, and you know you're in some sorry shit when Black Dow starts smiling.\n'Ninefingers,' he grunted.\n'Dow. Run out of men to burn, have you?'\n'Reckon Bethod'll be sending me some more presently.' He nodded towards the\nwall. 'What d'you think he'll send today?'\n'After what we gave 'em last night, I reckon those Crinna bastards are just about\ndone.'\n'Bloody savages. I reckon they are at that.'\n'And there've been no Shanka for a few days now.'\n'Four days, since he sent the Flatheads at us.'\nLogen squinted up at the sky, slowly getting lighter. 'Looks like good weather\ntoday. Good weather for armour, and swords, and men walking shoulder to\nshoulder. Good weather to try and finish us. Wouldn't be surprised if he sends the\nCarls today.'\n'Nor me.'"

Wouldn't be surprised to see Whitesides,\nand Goring, and Pale-as-Snow, and fucking Littlebone and all the rest come strolling\nup to the gate after breakfast.'\nDow snorted. 'His best? Right crowd o' cunts, those.' And he turned his head\nand spat onto the mud.\n'You'll get no argument from me.'\n'That so? Didn't you fight alongside 'em, all those hard and bloody years?'\n'I did. But I can't say I ever much liked 'em.'\n'Well, if it's any consolation, I doubt they think too much o' you these days.'\nDow gave him a long look. 'When did Bethod stop suiting you, eh, Ninefingers?'\nLogen stared back at him. 'Hard to say. Bit by bit, I reckon. Maybe he got to be\nmore of a bastard as time went on. Or maybe I got to be less of one.'\n'Or maybe there ain't room on one side for two bastards as big as the pair o'\nyou.'\n'Oh, I don't know.' Logen got up. 'You and me work real sweet together.' He\nstalked away from Dow, thinking about what easy work Malacus Quai, and Ferro\nMaljinn, and even Jezal dan Luthar had been.\nSeven days, and they were all at each other's throats. All angry, all tired. Seven\ndays. The one consolation was that there couldn't be many more.\n'They're coming.'\nDogman's eyes flicked sideways. Like most of the few things Grim said, it hardly\nneeded saying. They could all see it as clearly as the sun rising. Bethod's Carls were\non the move.\nThey were in no hurry. They came on stiff and steady, painted shields held up in\nfront, eyes to the gateway. Standards flapped over their heads. Signs the Dogman\nrecognised from way back. He wondered how many of those men down there he'd\nfought alongside. How many of their faces he could put a name to. How many he'd\ndrunk with, eaten with, laughed with, that he'd have to do his best to put back in the\nmud. He took a long breath. The battlefield's no place for sentiment, Threetrees had\ntold him once, and he'd taken it right to heart.\n'Alright!' He lifted up his hand as the men around him on the tower readied their\nbows, 'Hold on to 'em for a minute yet!'\nThe Carls stomped on through the churned-up mud and the broken rocks where\nthe valley narrowed, past the bodies of Easterners, and Shanka, left twisted where\nthey lay, hacked, or crushed, or stuck with broken arrows. They didn't falter, or lose\na step, the wall of shields shifted as they came, but didn't break. Not the slightest\ngap.\n'They march tight,' muttered Tul.\n'Aye. Too tight, the bastards.'\nThey were getting close, now. Close enough that Dogman had to try some"

Aim high and let 'em drop!' The first flight went hissing from\nthe tower, arced up high and started to fall on that tight column. They shifted their\nshields to meet them and arrows thudded into painted wood, spun off helmets and\nglanced off mail. A couple found marks, a shriek went up. Holes showed, here or\nthere, but the rest just stepped on over, trudging up towards the wall.\nDogman frowned at the barrels where the shafts were kept. Less than quarter full,\nnow, and most of those dug out from dead men. 'Careful now! Pick your marks,\nlads!'\n'Uh,' said Grim, pointing down below. A good-sized pack o' men were scurrying\nout from the ditch, dressed in stiff leather and steel capped. They formed up in a few\nneat rows, kneeling down, tending to their weapons. Flatbows, like the Union used.\n'Get down!' shouted Dogman.\nThose nasty little bows rattled and spat. Most of the boys on the tower were well\nbehind their parapet by then, but one optimist who'd been leaning out got a bolt\nthrough his mouth, swayed and toppled, silent, off the tower. Another took one in\nhis chest, breathing with a wheeze like wind through a split pine.\n'Alright! Give 'em something back!' They all came up at once and sent down a\nvolley, strings humming, peppering those bastards with plunging shafts. Their bows\nmight not have had the same spit to 'em, but with the height the arrows still came\nhard, and Bethod's archers had nothing to hide behind. More than a few fell back or\nstarted crawling away, screaming and squealing, but the rank behind pushed through,\nslow and steady, knelt down and aimed their flatbows.\nAnother flight of bolts came hissing up. Men ducked and threw themselves\ndown. One zipped right past the Dogman's head and clicked off the rock face\nbehind. Pure luck he didn't get pinned with it. A couple of the others were less lucky.\nOne lad was lying on his back, a pair of bolts stuck in his chest, peering down at 'em\nand whispering, 'shit', to himself, over and over.\n'Bastards!'\n'Let'em have it back!'\nShafts and bolts started flapping up both ways, men shouting and taking aim, all\nanger and gritted teeth. 'Steady!' shouted Dogman, 'steady!' but no one hardly heard\nhim. With the extra poke from the height and the cover they had from the walls,\ndidn't take long for Dogman's boys to get the upper hand. Bethod's archers started\nscrambling back, then a couple dropped their flatbows and made a run for it, one\ngetting a shaft right through his back. The rest started to break for the ditch, leaving\ntheir wounded crawling in the mud.\n'Uh,' said Grim again.

While they'd been busy trading shafts the Carls had made it\nright to the gate, shields up over their heads against the rocks and arrows the hillmen\nwere chucking down. They'd got the ditch filled in a day or two before, and now the\ncolumn opened up in the middle and those mailed men moved like they were passing\nsomething to the front. Dogman caught a glimpse of it. A long, thin tree trunk, cut\ndown to use as a ram, branches left on short so men could give it a firm swing.\nDogman heard the first tearing crash of it working at their sorry excuse for a gate.\n'Shit,' he muttered.\nKnots of Thralls were charging forward now, light-armed and light-armoured,\ncarrying ladders between 'em, counting on speed to make it to the walls. Plenty fell,\npricked with spear or arrow, knocked with rocks. Some of their ladders were\npushed back, but they were quick and full of bones, and stuck to their task. Soon\nthere were a couple of groups on the walls while more pressed up the ladders\nbehind, fighting with Crummock's people and getting the better by pure freshness\nand weight of numbers.\nNow there was a big crack and the gate went down. Dogman saw that tree-trunk\nswing one last time and cave one door right in. The Carls struggled with the other\nand heaved it open, a couple of stones bouncing from the shields and spinning\naway. The front few started pressing forwards through the gate.\n'Shit,' said Grim.\n'They're through,' breathed the Dogman, and he watched Bethod's Carls push on\ninto that narrow gap in a mailed tide, trampling the shattered gates under their heavy\nboots, dragging the rocks behind out of the way, their bright-painted shields up, their\nbright-polished weapons ready. To either side the Thralls swarmed up their ladders\nand onto the wall, pressing Crummock's hillmen back down the walkways. Like a\nhigh river bursting a dam, Bethod's host flowed into the broken fortress, first in a\ntrickle, and soon in a flood.\n'I'm going down!' snarled Tul, dragging his great long sword out of its sheath.\nDogman thought about trying to stop him, but then he just nodded, tired, and\nwatched the Thunderhead charge off down the steps, a few others following. There\nwas no point getting in their way. Seemed like it was fast reaching that time.\nTime for each man to choose where he'd die.\nLogen saw them come through the gates, up the ramp and into the fortress. Time\nseemed to move slow. He saw each design on each shield picked out sharp in the\nmorning sun—black tree, red bridge, two wolves on green, three horses on yellow.\nMetal glinted and flashed—shield's rim, mail's ring, spear's point, sword's edge. On\nthey came, yelling their battle cries, high and thin, the way they'd done for years. The\nbreath crawled in and out of Logen's nose. The Thralls and the hillmen fought on the\nwalls as if they were underwater, their sounds dull and muffled. His palms sweated,\nand tickled, and itched as he watched the Carls break in.

Hardly seemed as if it could\nbe true that he had to charge into those bastards and kill as many as he could. What\na damn fool notion.\nHe felt that powerful need, as he always had at times like that, to turn and run. All\naround he felt the fear of the others, their uncertain shuffling, their edging backwards.\nA sensible enough instinct, except there was nowhere now to run to. Nowhere\nexcept forwards, into the teeth of the enemy, and hope to drive them out before they\ncould get a foothold. There was nothing to think about. It was their only chance.\nSo Logen lifted the Maker's sword high, and he gave a meaningless scream, and\nhe started running. He heard the shouts around him, felt the men moving with him,\nthe jostling and rattling of weapons. The ground, and the wall, and the Carls he ran at\njolted and wobbled. His boots pounded on the earth, his own quick breath hissed\nand rushed with the wind.\nHe saw the Carls hurrying to set their shields, to form a wall, to make ready their\nspears and their weapons, but they were in a mess after coming through that narrow\ngate, flustered by the screaming mass of men charging down on them. The war-cries\ndied in their throats and their faces sagged from triumph to shock. A couple at the\nedges started to have doubts, and they faltered, and shuffled back, and then Logen\nand the rest were on them.\nHe managed to twist around a wobbling spear and land a good hard chop on a\nshield with all the force of his charge, knock his man sprawling in the mud. Logen\nhacked at his leg as he tried to get up and the blade cut through mail and left a long\ngash in flesh, brought him shrieking down again. Logen swung at another Carl, felt\nthe Maker's sword squeal against the metal rim of a shield and slide into flesh. A man\ngurgled, vomited blood down the front of his mail coat.\nLogen saw an axe thud into a helmet and leave a dent the size of a fist in it. He\nreeled out of the way of a spear thrust and it stuck in the ribs of a man beside him. A\nsword hacked into a shield and sent splinters flying into Logen's eyes. He blinked,\nand dodged, slid in the muck, chopped at an arm as it tore at his coat and felt it\nbreak, flapping in its mail sleeve. Eyes rolled in a bloody face. Something shoved\nhim in the back and nearly pushed him onto a sword.\nThere was hardly space to swing, then there was no space at all. Men crushed in\nfrom behind, crushed in through the gate, adding their straining, mindless weight to\nthe press in the centre. Logen was squashed in tight, shoulder to shoulder. Men\ngasped and grunted, dug and elbowed at each other, stabbed with knives and\ngouged at faces with their fingers.

Logen tried to press\ntowards him but the blind currents of battle snatched him away and carried them far\napart.\nHe stabbed at someone under a shield rim, winced as he felt something dig into\nhis hip. A long, slow, burning, getting worse and worse. He growled as the blade\ncut, not swung, or thrust, just held there while he was squashed up against it. He\nthrashed with his elbows, with his head, managed to twist away from the pain, felt\nthe wetness of blood down his leg. He found himself with room, got his sword-hand\nfree, hacked at a shield, chopped a head open on the backswing then found himself\nshoved up against it, his face pressed into warm brains.\nHe saw a shield jerk up out of the corner of his eye. The edge caught him in the\nthroat, under the chin, snapped his head back and filled his skull with blinding light.\nBefore he knew it he was rolling, coughing, slithering in the filth down among the\nboots.\nHe dragged himself nowhere, clutching at dirt, spitting blood, boots squelching\nand straining in the mud all around him. Crawling through a dark, terrifying, shifting\nforest of legs, the screams of pain and rage filtering down from above with the\nflickering light. Feet kicked at him, stomped on him, battered at every part of him.\nHe tried to struggle up and a boot in the mouth sent him limp again. He rolled over,\ngasping, saw a bearded Carl in the same state, impossible to say which side he was\non, trying to push himself up out of the mud. Their eyes met, for a moment, then a\nglinting spear blade shot down from above and stabbed the Carl in the back, once,\ntwice, three times. He went limp, blood gurgling down through his beard. There were\nbodies all around, on their faces and their sides, lying in amongst the dropped and\nbroken gear, kicked and knocked around like children's dolls, some of them still\ntwitching, clutching, grunting.\nLogen squawked as a boot squelched down hard on his hand, crushing his\nfingers into the muck. He fumbled a knife from his belt and started slashing weakly at\nthe leg above it, bloody teeth gritted. Something cracked him in the top of the head\nand sent him sprawling on his face again.\nThe world was a noisy blur, a painful smear, a mass of feet and anger. He didn't\nknow which way he was facing, which way was up or down. His mouth tasted of\nmetal, thirsty. There was blood in his eyes, mud in his eyes, his head was pounding,\nhe wanted to be sick.\nBack to the North, and get some vengeance.

They were charging up it now, or as close as they\ncould get to a charge on those narrow steps. Dogman dropped his bow and fumbled\nhis sword out from its sheath, got a knife ready in the other hand. A few of the\nothers took up spears, gathered round the head of the stairway as the Thralls came\nup. Dogman swallowed. He'd never been much for fights like this, toe to toe, no\nmore'n the length of an axe from your enemies. He'd rather have kept things to a\npolite distance, but that didn't seem to be what these bastards had in mind.\nAn awkward kind of a fight started up at the top of the steps, defenders poking\nwith spears, trying to shove the Thralls off, them poking back, shoving with shields,\ntrying to get a foothold on the platform at the top, everyone taking care in case they\ntook the long drop right back to the mud.\nOne charged through with a spear, screaming at the top of his lungs, and Grim\nshot him in the face, cool as you like, no more'n a stride or two distant. He staggered\na step or two, bent right over with the flights of the arrows sticking out his mouth\nand the point out the back of his neck, then Dogman took the top of his head off\nwith his sword and sent his corpse sprawling.\nA big Thrall with wild red hair leaped up the steps, swinging a big axe, roaring\nlike a madman. He got round a spear and felled an archer with a blow that spattered\nblood across the rock face, charged on through, folk scattering out o' the way.\nDogman dithered, trying to look like he was an idiot, then when the axe came\ndown he dodged left and the blade missed him by a whisker. The red-haired Thrall\nstumbled, tired from getting over the wall and up all them steps, most likely. A long\nway to climb, especially with nothing but your death at the end of it. Dogman kicked\nhard at the side of his knee and his leg buckled, he yelled as he lurched towards the\nedge of the stairs. Dogman chopped at him with his sword, caught him a slash\nacross the back, hard enough to send him over the edge. He dropped his axe,\nscreamed as he tumbled through the empty air.\nDogman felt something move, turned just in time to see another Thrall coming at\nhim from the side. He twisted round and knocked the first sword-cut clear, gasped\nas he felt the second thud cold into his arm, heard his sword clatter out of his limp\nhand. He jerked away from another swing, tripped and went down on his back. The\nThrall came at him, lifting up his sword to finish the job, but before he got more'n a\nstride Grim loomed up quick from the side, caught hold of his sword-arm and held it\npinned. Dogman scrambled up, taking a hard grip on his knife with his good hand,\nand stabbed the Thrall right in his chest.

They stayed there, the three of 'em, tangled\nup tight together, still in the midst of all that madness, for as long as it took for the\nman to die. Then Dogman pulled his knife free and Grim let him fall.\nThey'd got the best of it up on the tower, at least for now. There was just one\nThrall left on his feet, and while the Dogman watched a couple of his lads herded\nhim up to the parapet and poked him off with spears. There were corpses scattered\nall about the place. A couple of dozen Thralls, maybe half that many of the\nDogman's boys. One of 'em was propped against the cliff face, chest heaving as he\nbreathed, face pasty pale, bloody hands clutched to his slashed guts.\nDogman's hand wouldn't work right, the fingers dangled useless. He tugged his\nshirtsleeve up, saw a long gash oozing from his elbow almost all the way to his wrist.\nHis guts gave a heave and he coughed a bit of burning puke up and spat it out.\nWounds on other people you can get used to. Cuts out of your own flesh always\nhave a horror to 'em.\nDown below, inside the wall, the fight was joined and nothing but a boiling,\ntight-pressed mass. Dogman could hardly tell which men were on which side. He\nstood frozen, bloody knife clutched in one bloody hand. There were no answers\nnow, no plans. It was every man for himself. If they lived out the day it would be by\nluck alone, and he was starting to doubt he had that much luck left. He felt someone\ntugging at his sleeve. Grim. He followed his pointed finger with his eyes.\nBeyond Bethod's camp, down in the valley, a great cloud of dust was coming up,\na brown haze. Underneath, glittering in the morning sun, the armour of horsemen.\nHis hand clamped tight round Grim's wrist, hope suddenly flickering alive again.\n'Fucking Union!' he breathed, hardly daring to believe it.\nWest squinted through his eye-glass, lowered it and peered up the valley, squinted\nthrough it again. 'You're sure?'\n'Yes, sir.' Jalenhorm's big, honest face was streaked with the dirt of eight days'\nhard riding. 'And it looks as if they're still holding out, just barely.'\n'General Poulder!' snapped West.\n'My Lord Marshal?' murmured Poulder with his newly acquired veneer of\nsycophancy.\n'Are the cavalry ready to charge?'\nThe General blinked. 'They are not properly deployed, have been riding hard\nthese past days, and would be charging uphill over broken ground and at a strong\nand determined enemy. They will do as you order, of course, Lord Marshal, but it\nmight be prudent to wait for our infantry to—'\n'Prudence is a luxury.' West frowned up towards that innocuous space between\nthe two fells.

Or wait for the infantry to arrive, still some hours behind, and mount\na well-planned assault? But by then would the Dogman and his friends have been\nslaughtered to a man, their fortress taken and Bethod well prepared to meet an attack\nfrom one side only?\nWest chewed at his lip, trying to ignore the fact that thousands of lives hung upon\nhis decision. To attack now was the greater risk, but might offer the greater rewards.\nA chance to finish this war within a bloody hour. They might never again catch the\nKing of the Northmen off guard. What was it that Burr had said to him, the night\nbefore he died? One cannot be a great leader without a certain… ruthlessness.\n'Prepare the charge, and deploy our infantry across the mouth of the valley as\nsoon as they arrive. We must prevent Bethod and any of his forces from escaping. If\nsacrifices are to be made, I intend that they be meaningful.' Poulder looked anything\nbut convinced. 'Will you force me to agree with General Kroy's assessment of your\nfighting qualities, General Poulder? Or do you intend to prove the two of us wrong?'\nThe General snapped to attention, his moustaches vibrating with new eagerness.\n'Respectfully, sir, to prove you wrong! I will order the charge immediately!'\nHe gave his black charger the spurs and flew off up the valley, towards the place\nwhere the dusty cavalry were massing, pursued by several members of his staff.\nWest shifted in his saddle, chewing worriedly at his lip. His head was beginning to\nhurt again. A charge, uphill, against a determined enemy.\nColonel Glokta would no doubt have grinned at the prospect of such a deadly\ngamble. Prince Ladisla would have approved of such cavalier carelessness with\nother men's lives. Lord Smund would have slapped backs, and talked of vim and\nvigour, and called for wine.\nAnd only look what became of those three heroes.\nLogen heard a great roar, faint, and far away. Light came at his half-closed eyes, as\nthough the fight was opened up wide. Shadows flickered. A great boot squelched in\nthe filth in front of his face. Voices bellowed, far above. He felt himself grabbed by\nthe shirt, dragged through the mud, feet and legs thrashing all around him. He saw\nthe sky, painful bright, blinked and dribbled at it. He lay still, limp as a rag.\n'Logen! You alright? Where you hurt?'\n'I—' he croaked, then started coughing.\n'D'you know me?' Something slapped at Logen's face, slapped some sluggish\nthought into his head. A shaggy shape loomed over him, dark against the bright sky.\nLogen squinted at it. Tul Duru Thunderhead, unless he was much mistaken. What\nthe hell was he doing here? Thinking was painful. The more Logen thought, the more\npain he was in. His jaw was on fire, feeling twice the size it usually did. His every\nbreath was a shuddering, slavering gasp.\nAbove him the big man's mouth moved, and the words boomed and rang against"

His leg prickled unpleasantly, far\naway, his own heartbeat leaped and jerked and pounded at his head. He heard\nsounds, clashing and rattling, coming at him from all sides, and the sounds\nthemselves hurt him, made his jaw burn all the worse, unbearable.\n'Get…' The air rasped and clicked, but no sound would come. It wasn't his voice\nany longer. He reached out, with his last strength, and he put his palm against Tul's\nchest, and he tried to push him away, but the big man only caught his hand and\npressed it with his own.\n'It's alright,' he growled. 'I've got you.'\n'Aye,' whispered Logen, and the smile spread out across his bloody mouth. He\ngripped that great hand with a sudden, terrible strength, and with his other fist he\nfound the handle of a knife, tucked down warm against his skin. The good blade\ndarted out, swift as the snake and just as deadly, and sank into the big man's thick\nneck to the hilt. He looked surprised, as the hot blood poured from his open throat,\ndrooled from his open mouth, soaked his heavy beard, dribbled from his nose and\ndown his chest, but he shouldn't have.\nTo touch the Bloody-Nine was to touch death, and death has no favourites, and\nmakes no exceptions.\nThe Bloody-Nine rose up, shoving the great corpse away from him, and his red\nfist closed tight around the giant's sword, a heavy length of star-bright metal, dark\nand beautiful, a righteous tool for the work that awaited him. So much work.\nBut good work is the best of blessings. The Bloody-Nine opened his mouth, and\nshrieked out all his bottomless love and his endless hate in one long wail. The\nground rushed underneath him, and the heaving, writhing, beautiful battle reached out\nand took him in its soft embrace, and he was home.\nThe faces of the dead shifted, blurred around him, roaring their curses and\nbellowing their anger. But their hate of him only made him stronger. The long sword\nflung men out of his path and left them twisted and broken, hacked and drooling,\nhowling with happiness. Who fought who was none of his concern. The living were\non one side, and he was on the other, and he carved a red and righteous way through\ntheir ranks.\nAn axe flashed in the sun, a bright curve like the waning moon, and the\nBloody-Nine slid below it, kicked a man away with a heavy boot. He lifted up a\nshield, but the great sword split the painted tree, and the wood beneath it, and the\narm beneath that, and tore open the mail behind as though it was nothing but a\ncobweb, and split his belly like a sack of angry snakes.\nA boy-child cowered, and slithered away on his back, clutching at a great shield\nand an axe too big for him to lift.

A tiny voice seemed to whisper for restraint, but the Bloody-Nine\nhardly heard it. His sword hard-swung split big shield and small body together and\nsprayed blood across the dirt and the stone and the stricken faces of the men\nwatching.\n'Good,' he said, and he showed his bloody smile. He was the Great Leveller. Man\nor woman, young or old, all were dealt with exactly alike. That was the brutal beauty\nof it, the awful symmetry of it, the perfect justice of it. There could be no escape and\nno excuses. He came forward, taller than the mountains, and the men shuffled, and\nmuttered, and spread out from him. A circle of shields, of painted designs, of\nflowering trees, and rippling water, and snarling faces.\nTheir words tickled at his ears.\n'It's him.'\n'Ninefingers.'\n'The Bloody-Nine!'\nA circle of fear, with him at the centre, and they were wise to fear.\nTheir deaths were written in the shapes of sweet blood on the bitter ground. Their\ndeaths were whispered in the buzzing of the flies on the corpses beyond the wall.\nTheir deaths were stamped on their faces, carried on the wind, held in the crooked\nline between the mountains and the sky. Dead men, all.\n'Who's next to the mud?' he whispered.\nA bold Carl stepped forward, a shield on his arm with a coiled serpent upon it.\nBefore he could even lift his spear the Bloody-Nine's sword had made a great circle,\nabove the top of his shield and below the bottom of his helmet. The point of the\nblade stole the jawbone from his head, cleaved into the shoulder of the next man, ate\ndeep into his chest and drove him into the earth, blood flying from his silent mouth.\nAnother man loomed up and the sword fell on him like a falling star, crushed his\nhelmet and the skull beneath it down to his mouth. The body dropped on its back\nand danced a merry jig in the dirt.\n'Dance!' laughed the Bloody-Nine, and the sword reeled around him. He filled the\nair with blood, and broken weapons, and the parts of men, and these good things\nwrote secret letters, and described sacred patterns that only he could see and\nunderstand. Blades pricked and nicked and dug at him but they were nothing. He\nrepaid each mark upon his burning skin one-hundred fold, and the Bloody-Nine\nlaughed, and the wind, and the fire, and the faces on the shields laughed with him,\nand could not stop.\nHe was the storm in the High Places, his voice as terrible as the thunder, his arm\nas quick, as deadly, as pitiless as the lightning. He rammed the sword through a\nman's guts, ripped it back and smashed a man's mouth apart with the pommel,\nsnatched his spear away with his free hand and flung it through the neck of a third,\nsplit a Carl's side yawning open as he passed. He reeled, spun, rolled, drunken\ndizzy, spitting fire and laughter. He forged a new circle about him. A circle as wide\nas the giant's sword. A circle in which the world belonged to him."

Then he darted forward and seized the man by his throat, lifting him up into\nthe air with both his hands. He thrashed and kicked and wrestled, but the\nBloody-Nine's red grip was the swelling ice that bursts the very bones of the earth\napart.\n'You are forgiven!' His hands were made of iron, and his thumbs sunk deeper\nand deeper into the man's neck until blood welled up from under them, and he lifted\nthe kicking corpse out to arm's length and held it above him until it was still.

There was no smell to speak of. Except the stench of\ndishonesty, which even I find almost overpowering.

He watched the clerks working at their neat\nstacks of documents, at their neat desks arranged in neat rows. There the acolytes,\ninducted into the lowest mysteries of the church. His eyes flickered to those waiting.\nMerchants and moneylenders, shopkeepers and shysters, traders and tricksters in\nlong queues, or waiting nervously on hard chairs around the hard walls. Fine clothes,\nperhaps, but anxious manners. The fearful congregation, ready to cower should the\ndeity of commerce show her vengeful streak.\nBut I am not her creature. Glokta shouldered his way past the longest queue, the\ntip of his cane squealing loud against the tiles, snarling, 'I am crippled!' if one of the\nmerchants dared to look his way.\nThe clerk blinked at him when he reached the front of the line. 'How may I—'\n'Mauthis,' barked Glokta.\n'And who shall I say is—'\n'The cripple.' Convey me to the high priest, that I might cleanse my crimes in\nbanking notes.\n'I cannot simply—'\n'You are expected!' Another clerk, a few rows back, had stood up from his desk.\n'Please come with me.'\nGlokta gave the unhappy queue a toothless leer as he limped out between the\ndesks toward a door in the far, panelled wall, but his smile did not last. Beyond it, a\nset of high steps rose up, light filtering down from a narrow window at the top.\nWhat is it about power, that it has to be higher up than everyone else? Can a\nman not be powerful on the ground floor? He cursed and struggled up after his\nimpatient guide, then dragged his useless leg down a long hallway with many high\ndoors on either side. The clerk leaned forward and humbly knocked at one, waited\nfor a muffled 'Yes?' and opened it.\nMauthis sat behind a monumental desk watching Glokta hobble over the\nthreshold. His face could have been carved from wood for all the warmth or\nwelcome it displayed. On the expanse of blood-coloured leather before him pens,\nand ink, and neat piles of papers were arranged with all the merciless precision of\nrecruits on a parade ground.\n'The visitor you were expecting, sir.'

He took a lurching step and sagged into the nearest chair, stiff\nleather creaking uncomfortably under his aching arse. But it will serve.\nThe papers crackled as Mauthis leafed through them, his pen scratching his name\nat the bottom of each one. He paused at the last. 'And no. This must be called in at\nonce.'

It thumped down against the\npaper with a disturbing finality. And is some merchant's life squashed out under\nthat stamp, do we suppose? Is that ruin and despair, so carelessly administered?\nIs that wives and children, out upon the street? There is no blood here, there are\nno screams, and yet men are destroyed as completely as they are in the House of\nQuestions, and with a fraction of the effort.\nGlokta's eyes followed the clerk as he hurried out with the documents. Or is it\nmerely a receipt for ten bits, refused? Who can say? The door was pulled softly and\nprecisely shut with the gentlest of smooth clicks.\nMauthis paused only to align his pen precisely with the edge of his desk, then he\nlooked up at Glokta. 'I am truly grateful that you have answered promptly.'\nGlokta snorted. 'The tone of your note did not seem to allow for delay.' He\nwinced as he lifted his aching leg with both hands and heaved his dirty boot up onto\nthe chair beside him. 'I hope you will return the favour and come promptly to the\npoint. I am extremely busy.' I have Magi to destroy, and Kings to bring down, and,\nif I cannot do one or the other, I have a pressing appointment to have my throat\ncut and be tossed in the sea.\nMauthis' face did not so much as flicker. 'Once again, I find that my superiors are\nnot best pleased with the direction of your investigations.'\nIs that so? 'Your superiors are people of deep pockets and shallow patience.\nWhat now offends their delicate sensibilities?'\n'Your investigation into the lineage of our new King, his August Majesty Jezal the\nFirst.' Glokta felt his eye twitch, and he pressed his hand against it with a sour\nsucking of his gums. 'In particular your enquiries into the person of Carmee dan\nRoth, the circumstances of her untimely demise, and the closeness of her friendship\nwith our previous King, Guslav the Fifth. Do I come close enough to the point for\nyour taste?'\nA little closer than I would like, in fact. 'Those enquiries have scarcely even\nbegun. I find it surprising that your superiors are so very well informed. Do they\nacquire their information from a crystal ball, or a magic mirror?' Or from someone at\nthe House of Questions who likes to talk? Or from someone closer to me even than\nthat, perhaps?\nMauthis sighed, or at least, he allowed some air to issue from his face. 'I told you\nto assume that they know everything. You will discover it is no exaggeration,\nparticularly if you choose to try and deceive them. I would advise you very strongly\nagainst that course of action.'\n'Believe me when I say,' muttered Glokta through tight lips, 'that I have no interest\nwhatsoever in the King's parentage, but his Eminence has demanded it, and keenly\nawaits a report of my progress.

I suppose you could go to\nthe Arch Lector, and lay before him the whole history of our involvement. The gift\nyou took from my employers, the conditions under which it was given, the\nconsideration you have already extended to us. Perhaps his Eminence is more\nforgiving of divided loyalties than he appears to be.'\n'Huh,' snorted Glokta. If I did not know better, I might have almost taken that\nfor a joke. His Eminence is only slightly less forgiving than a scorpion, and we\nboth know it.\n'Or you could honour your commitment to my employers, and do as they\ndemand.'\n'They asked for favours, when I signed the damn receipt.

'But if my own\nexperience is anything to go by… it will not end. My employers have paid. And they\nalways get what they have paid for. Always.'\nGlokta swallowed. It would seem that, in this case, they have paid for my abject\nobedience. It would not normally be a difficulty, of course, I am every bit as abject\nas the next man, if not more so. But the Arch Lector demands the same. Two\nwell-informed and merciless masters in direct opposition begins too late to seem\nlike one too many. Two too many, some might say. But as Mauthis so kindly\nexplains, I have no choice. He slid his boot off the chair, leaving a long streak of dirt\nacross the leather, and shifted his weight painfully as he began the long process of\ngetting up.

'They wish me to what?'\n'There has been a great deal of change of late, Superior. Change means new\nopportunities, but too much change is bad for business. My employers feel a period\nof stability is in everyone's best interests. They are satisfied with the situation.'\nMauthis clenched his pale hands together on the red leather. 'They are concerned\nthat some figures within the government may not be satisfied. That they may seek\nfurther change. That their rash actions might lead to chaos. His Eminence concerns\nthem especially. They wish to know what he does. What he plans. They wish, in\nparticular, to know what he is doing in the University.'\nGlokta gave a splutter of disbelieving laughter. 'Is that all?'\nThe irony was wasted on Mauthis. 'For now. It might be best if you were to leave\nby the back entrance.

How could they know? First that I was looking into Prince\nRaynault's death, against the Arch Lectors orders, and now that I am looking into\nour Majesty's mother, on the Arch Lector's behalf Assume they know everything, of\ncourse, but no one knows anything without being told.\nWho… told?\nWho asked the questions, about the Prince and about the King? Whose first\nloyalty is to money? Who has already given me up once to save his skin? Glokta\npaused for a moment, in the middle of the steps, and frowned. Oh, dear, dear. Is it\nevery man for himself, now? Has it always been?\nThe pain shooting up his wasted leg was the only reply.\nSweet Victory\n« ^ »\nWest sat, arms crossed upon his saddle-bow, staring numbly up the dusty valley.\n'We won,' said Pike, in a voice without emotion. Just the same voice in which he\nmight have said, 'We lost.'\nA couple of tattered standards still stood, hanging lifeless. Bethod's own great\nbanner had been torn down and trampled beneath horses' hooves, and now its\nthreadbare frame stuck up at a twisted angle, above the settling fog of dust, like\nclean-picked bones. A fitting symbol for the sudden fall of the King of the\nNorthmen.\nPoulder reined in his horse beside West, smiling primly at the carnage like a\nschoolmaster at an orderly classroom.\n'How did we fare, General?'\n'Casualties appear to have been heavy, sir, especially in our front ranks, but the\nenemy were largely taken by surprise. Most of their best troops were already\ncommitted to the attack on the fortress. Once our cavalry got them on the run, we\ndrove them all the way to the walls! Picked their camp clean.' Poulder wrinkled his\nnose, moustaches trembling with distaste. 'Several hundred of those devilish Shanka\nwe put to the sword, and a much greater number we drove off into the hills to the\nnorth, from whence, I do not doubt, they will be greatly reluctant to return. We\nwrought a slaughter among the Northmen to satisfy King Casamir himself, and the\nrest have laid down their arms. We guess at five thousand prisoners, sir. Bethod's\narmy has been quite crushed. Crushed!' He gave a girlish chuckle. 'No one could\ndeny that you have well and truly avenged the death of Crown Prince Ladisla today,\nLord Marshal!'\nWest swallowed. 'Of course. Well and truly avenged.'\n'A master-stroke, to use our Northmen as a decoy. A bold and a decisive\nmanoeuvre. I am, and will always be, honoured to have played my small part! A\nfamous day for Union arms! Marshal Burr would have been proud to see it!'\nWest had never in his life expected to receive praise from General Poulder, but\nnow the great moment had come he found that he could take no pleasure in it. He\nhad performed no acts of bravery. He had taken no risks with his own life. He had\ndone nothing but say charge. He felt saddle-sore and bone-weary, his jaw ached"

He felt saddle-sore and bone-weary, his jaw ached\nfrom being constantly clenched with worry. Even speaking seemed an effort. 'Is\nBethod among the dead, or the captured?'\n'As to specific prisoners, sir, I could not say. It may be that our Northern allies\nhave him.' Poulder gave vent to a jagged chuckle. 'In which case I doubt he'll be with\nus much longer, eh, Marshal? Eh, Sergeant Pike?' He grinned as he drew his finger\nsharply across his belly and clicked his tongue. 'The bloody cross for him, I\nshouldn't wonder! Isn't that what they do, these savages? The bloody cross, isn't it?'\nWest did not see the funny side. 'Ensure that our prisoners are given food and\nwater, and such assistance with their wounded as we are able to provide. We should\nbe gracious in victory.' It seemed like the sort of thing that a leader should say, after\na battle.\n'Quite so, my Lord Marshal.' And Poulder gave a smart salute, the very model of\nan obedient underling, then reined his mount sideways and spurred away.\nWest slid down from his own horse, gathered himself for a moment, and began\nto trudge on foot up the valley. Pike came after him, sword drawn.\n'Can't be too careful, sir,' he said.\n'No,' murmured West. 'I suppose not.'\nThe long slope was scattered with men, alive and dead. The corpses of Union\nhorsemen lay where they had fallen. Surgeons tended to the wounded with bloody\nhands and grim faces. Some men sat and wept, perhaps by fallen comrades. Some\nstared numbly at their own wounds. Others howled and gurgled, screamed for help,\nor water. Still others rushed to bring it to them. Final kindnesses, for the dying. A\nlong procession of sullen prisoners was winding down the valley alongside the rock\nwall, watched carefully by mounted Union soldiers. Nearby were tangled heaps of\nsurrendered weapons, piles of mail coats, stacks of painted shields.\nWest picked his way slowly through what had been Bethod's camp, rendered in\none furious half-hour into a great expanse of rubbish, scattered across the bare rock\nand the hard earth. The twisted bodies of men and horses were mixed in with the\ntrampled frames of tents, ripped and dragged-out canvas, burst barrels, broken\nboxes, gear for cooking, and mending, and fighting. All trodden into the churned\nmud, stamped with the smeared prints of hooves and boots.\nIn the midst of all this chaos there were strange islands of calm, where all seemed\nundisturbed, just as it must have been before West ordered the charge. A pot still\nhung over a smouldering fire, stew bubbling inside. A set of spears were neatly\nstacked against each other, with stool and whetstone beside, ready to be sharpened.\nThree bedrolls formed a perfect triangle, blankets well folded at the head of each\none, all neat and orderly, except that a man lay sprawled across them, the contents\nof his gaping skull splattered across the pale wool.\nNot far beyond a Union officer knelt in the mud, cradling another in his arms."

The one on his knees was his old friend\nLieutenant Brint. The one lying limp was his old friend Lieutenant Kaspa. For some\nreason, West felt an almost overpowering urge to walk away, off up the slope\nwithout stopping, and pretend not to have seen them. He had to force himself to\nstride over, his mouth filling with sour spit.\nBrint looked up, pale face streaked with tears. 'An arrow,' he whispered. 'Just a\nstray. He never even drew his sword.'\n'Bad luck,' grunted Pike. 'Bad luck.'\nWest stared down. Bad luck indeed. He could just see, snapped off at the edge\nof Kaspa's beard, under his jaw, the broken shaft of an arrow, but there was\nsurprisingly little blood. Few marks of any kind. A splatter of mud down one sleeve\nof his uniform, and that was all. Despite the fact they were, in essence, staring\ncross-eyed at nothing, West could not help the feeling that Kaspa's eyes were\nlooking directly into his. There was a peevish twist to his lip, an accusatory wrinkling\nof his brows. West almost wanted to take him up on it, demand to know what he\nmeant by it, then had to remind himself that the man was dead.\n'A letter, then,' muttered West, his fingers fussing with each other, 'to his family.'\nBrint gave a miserable sniff which West found, for some reason, utterly\ninfuriating. 'Yes, a letter.'\n'Yes. Sergeant Pike, with me.' West could not stand there a moment longer. He\nturned away from his friends, one living and one dead, and strode off up the valley.\nHe did his very best not to dwell on the fact that, had he not ordered the charge, one\nof the most pleasant and inoffensive men of his acquaintance would still be alive.\nOne cannot be a leader without a certain ruthlessness, perhaps. But ruthlessness is\nnot always easy.\nHe and Pike floundered over a crushed earth rampart and a trampled ditch, the\nvalley growing steadily narrower, the high cliffs of stone pressing in on either side.\nMore corpses here. Northmen, and wild men such as they found in Dunbrec, and\nShanka too, all peppered liberally across the broken ground. West could see the wall\nof the fortress now, little more than a mossy hump in the landscape with more death\nscattered round its foot.\n'They held out in there, for seven days?' muttered Pike.\n'So it would seem.'\nThe one entrance was a rough archway in the centre of the wall, its gates torn off\nand lying ruined. There seemed to be three strange shapes within it. As he got closer,\nWest realised with some discomfort what they were. Three men, hanging dead by\ntheir necks from ropes over the top of the wall, their limp boots swinging gently at\nabout chest height. There were a lot of grim Northmen gathered around that gate,\nlooking up at those dangling corpses with some satisfaction. One in particular turned\na cruel grin on West and Pike as they came close."

You always was a slow mover, lad.'\n'There were some difficulties. Marshal Burr is dead.'\n'Back to the mud, eh? Well, he's in good company, at least. Plenty of good men\ndone that these past days. Who's your chief, now?'\nWest took a long breath. 'I am.'\nDow laughed, and West watched him laugh, feeling the slightest bit sick. 'Big\nchief Furious, what do you know?' and he stood up straight and made a mockery of\na Union salute while the bodies turned slowly this way and that behind him. 'You\nshould meet my friends. They're all big men too. This here is Crendel Goring, fought\nfor Bethod from way back.' And he reached up and gave one of the bodies a shove,\nwatched it sway back and forth.\n'This here is Whitesides, and you couldn't have found a better man anywhere for\nkilling folk and stealing their land.' And he gave the next a push and set it spinning\nround and round one way, then back the other, limbs all limp and floppy.\n'And this one here is Littlebone. As hard a bastard as I've ever hung.' This last\nman was hacked near to meat, his gold-chased armour battered and dented, a great\nwound across his chest and his hanging grey hair thick with blood. One leg was off\nbelow his knee, and a pool of dry blood stained the ground underneath him.\n'What happened to him?' asked West.\n'To Littlebone?' The great fat hillman, Crummock-i-Phail, was one of the crowd.\n'He got cut down in the battle, fighting to the last man, over yonder.'\n'That he did,' said Dow, and he gave West a grin even bigger than usual. 'But\nthat's no kind of a reason not to hang him now, I reckon.'\nCrummock laughed. 'No kind of a reason!' And he smiled at the three bodies\nturning round and round, the ropes creaking. 'They make a pretty picture, don't they,\nhanging there? They say you can see all the beauty in the world in the way a hanged\nman swings.'\n'Who does?' asked West.\nCrummock shrugged his great shoulders. 'Them.'\n'Them, eh?' West swallowed his nausea and pushed his way between the hanging\nbodies into the fortress. 'They surely are a bloodthirsty crowd.'\nDogman took another pull at the flask. He was getting good and drunk now. 'Alright.\nLet's get it done then.'\nHe winced as Grim stuck the needle in, curled his lips back and hissed through\nhis teeth. A nice pricking and niggling to add to the dull throb. The needle went\nthrough the skin and dragged the thread after, and Dogman's arm started burning\nworse and worse. He took another swig, rocking back and forward, but it didn't\nhelp.\n'Shit,' he hissed. 'Shit, shit!'"

'Furious!' shouted the Dogman, feeling\na grin on his face even through the pain. 'Glad you could make it! Real glad!'\n'Better to come late than not to come at all.'\n'You'll get no trace of an argument from me. That is a fact.'\nWest frowned down at Grim sewing his arm up. 'You alright?'\n'Well, you know. Tul's dead.'\n'Dead?' West stared at him. 'How?'\n'It's a battle, ain't it? Dead men are the point o' the fucking exercise.' He waved\nthe flask around. 'I've been sat here, thinking about what I could've done differently.\nStopped him going down them steps, or gone down with him to watch his back, or\nmade the sky fall in, or all kind o' stupid notions, none of 'em any help to the dead\nnor the living.

Shit on it all, I say.'\nGrim pulled his knife out and cut the thread. 'Move your fingers.' It burned all the\nway up Dogman's arm to make a fist, but he forced the fingers closed, growling at\nthe pain as they bunched up tight.\n'Looks alright,' said Grim. 'You're lucky.'\nThe Dogman stared round miserably at the carnage. 'So this is what luck looks\nlike, is it? I've often wondered.' Grim shrugged his shoulders, ripped a piece of cloth\nfor a bandage.\n'Do you have Bethod?'\nDogman looked up at West, his mouth open. 'Don't you?'\n'A lot of prisoners, but he wasn't among them.'\nDogman turned his head and spat his disgust out into the mud. 'Nor his witch,\nnor his Feared, nor neither one of his swollen up sons, I'll be bound.'\n'I imagine they'll be riding for Carleon as swiftly as possible.'\n'More'n likely.'\n'I imagine he'll try to raise new forces, to find new allies, to prepare for a siege.'\n'I shouldn't wonder.'\n'We should follow him as soon as the prisoners are secure.'\nDogman felt a sudden wave of hopelessness, enough almost to knock him over.\n'By the dead. Bethod got away.' He laughed, and felt tears prickling his eyes the next\nmoment. 'Will there ever be an end to it?'\nGrim finished wrapping the bandage and tied it up tight. 'You're done.'\nDogman stared back at him. 'Done? I'm starting to think I won't ever be done.'\nHe held his hand out. 'Help me up, eh, Furious? I got a friend to bury.'"

Good weather, to\nbury a good man. They stood round the grave, all packed in tight. There were plenty\nof others being buried, the sad words for them wept and whispered all around, but\nTul had been well-loved, no man more, so there was quite the crowd. Even so, all\nround Logen there was a gap. An empty space a man wide. That space he used to\nhave around him in the old days, where no one would dare to stand. Logen hardly\nblamed them. He'd have run away himself, if he could.\n'Who wants to speak?' asked the Dogman, looking at them, one by one. Logen\nstared down at his feet, not even able to meet his eye, let alone say a word. He\nwasn't sure what had happened, in the battle, but he could guess. He could guess\nwell enough, from the bits he did remember. He glanced around, licking at his split\nlips, but if anyone else guessed, they kept it to themselves.\n'No one going to say a word?' asked Dogman again, his voice cracking.\n'Guess it best be fucking me, then, eh?' And Black Dow stepped forward. He\ntook a long look round at the gathering. Took a long look at Logen in particular, it\nseemed to him, but that was most likely just his own worries playing tricks.\n'Tul Duru Thunderhead,' said Dow. 'Back to the mud. The dead know, we didn't\nalways see things the same way, me and him. Didn't often agree on nothing, but\nmaybe that was my fault, as I'm a contrary bastard at the best o' times. I regret it\nnow, I reckon. Now it's too late.' He took a ragged breath.\n'Tul Duru. Every man in the North knew his name, and every man said it with\nrespect, even his enemies. He was the sort o' man… that gave you hope, I reckon.\nThat gave you hope. You want strength, do you? You want courage? You want\nthings done right and proper, the old way?' He nodded down at the new-turned\nearth. 'There you go. Tul Duru Thunderhead. Look no fucking further. I'm less, now\nthat he's gone, and so are all o' you.' And Dow turned and stalked off away from the\ngrave and into the dusk, his head down.\n'We're all less,' muttered Dogman, staring down at the earth with the glimmer of a\ntear in his eye. 'Good words.' They all looked broken up, every one of them stood\naround the grave. West, and his man Pike, and Shivers, and even Grim. All broken\nup.\nLogen wanted to feel as they did.

They were done with this madcap\nmission, and soon he would be back in Adua. Back in Ardee's arms. Warm and\nsafe. He snuggled down into his blankets at the thought. Then he frowned. There\nwas a knocking sound coming from somewhere. He opened his eyes a crack.\nSomeone hissed at him from across the room, and he turned his head.\nHe saw Terez' face, pale in the darkness, glaring from between the bed curtains,\nand the last few weeks came back in a horrible rush. She looked just as she had the\nday he married her, surely, and yet the perfect face of his queen seemed now ugly\nand hateful to him.\nThe royal bedchamber had become a battlefield. The border, watched with iron\ndetermination, was an invisible line between door and fireplace which Jezal crossed\nat his peril. The far side of the room was Styrian territory, and the mighty bed itself\nwas Terez' strongest citadel, its defences apparently impregnable. On the second\nnight of their marriage, hoping perhaps that there had been some misunderstanding\non the first, he had mounted a half-hearted assault which had left him with a bloody\nnose. Since then he had settled in hopelessly for a long and fruitless siege.\nTerez was the very mistress of deception. He would sleep on the floor, or on\nsome item of furniture never quite long enough, or wherever he pleased as long as it\nwas not with her. Then at breakfast she would smile at him, and speak of nothing,\nsometimes even place her hand fondly on his when she knew they were being\nwatched. Occasionally she would even have him believing that all was now well, but\nas soon as they were alone she would turn her back on him, and bludgeon him with\nsilence, and stab him with looks of such epic scorn and disgust that he wanted to be\nsick.\nHer ladies-in-waiting behaved towards him with scarcely less contempt whenever\nhe had the misfortune to find himself in their whispering presence.

He had felt like a peasant boy stumbling upon a coven of extremely\nwell-presented witches, chanting some dark curse. Probably one directed towards\nhimself. He was made to feel like the lowest, most repulsive animal alive. And he was\na king, in his own palace.\nFor some reason he lived in inexplicable horror that somebody would realise the\ntruth, but if any of the servants noticed they kept it to themselves.

Jezal frowned, suddenly wide awake. He\ndid not like the feel of this.\n'Your Majesty,' said Gorst.\n'What the hell is going on?'\n'The Gurkish have invaded Midderland.'\nFerro's eyes snapped open. She sprang up from the settle, her feet planted wide in a\nfighting stance, the torn-off table leg gripped tight in her fist. She cursed under her\nbreath. She had fallen asleep, and nothing good ever happened when she did that.\nBut there was no one in the room.\nAll dark and silent.\nNo sign of the cripple, or his black-masked servants. No sign of the armoured\nguards who watched her through narrowed eyes whenever she took a step down the\ntiled halls of this cursed place. Only the slightest chink of light under the panelled\ndoor that led through to Bayaz' room. That and a quiet murmuring of voices. She\nfrowned, and padded over, kneeling silently beside the keyhole.\n'Where have they landed?' Bayaz' voice, muffled through the wood.\n'Their first boats came ashore in the grey dusk, on the empty beaches at the\nsouthwestern tip of Midderland, near to Keln.' Yulwei.

'I am not sorry. To tinker with those forces… to bend the First\nLaw, if not to break it.

She had swallowed a bellyful of their lies, and their\nsecrets, and their promises. She had done nothing but talk, and wait, and talk again\nfor far too long.

When are they coming?'\n'Soon. Their scouts are already moving through the countryside of Midderland,\ntaking the villages and laying the fortresses under siege, making the country safe for\nthe rest who will come behind.'\n'Someone should stop them,' muttered Ferro, her nails digging into her palms.\nBayaz sat back in his chair, the shadows collecting in his craggy face. 'You speak\nmy very thoughts. Your luck has changed, eh, Ferro? I promised you vengeance,\nand now it drops ripe and bloody into your lap. Uthman's army has landed.\nThousands of Gurkish, and ready for war. They might be at the city gates within two\nweeks.'\n'Two weeks,' whispered Ferro.\n'But I have no doubt some Union soldiers will be going out to greet them sooner.\nI could find you a place with them, if you cannot wait.'\nShe had waited long enough. Thousands of Gurkish, and ready for war. The\nsmile tugged at one corner of Ferro's mouth, then grew, and grew, until her cheeks\nwere aching.\nPART II\n'Last Argument of Kings'\nInscribed on his cannons by Louis XIV\nThe Number of the Dead\n« ^ »\nIt was quiet in the village. The few houses, built from old stone with roofs of mossy\nslate, seemed deserted. The only life in the fields beyond, mostly fresh-harvested\nand ploughed over, were a handful of miserable crows. Next to Ferro the bell in the\ntower creaked softly. Some loose shutters on a window swung and tapped. A few\ncurled-up leaves fell on a gust of wind and fluttered gently to the empty square. On\nthe horizon three columns of dark smoke rose up just as gently into the heavy sky.\nThe Gurkish were coming, and they always had loved to burn.\n'Maljinn!' Major Vallimir was below, framed by the trapdoor, and Ferro scowled\ndown. He reminded her of Jezal dan Luthar when she had first met him. A plump,\npale face stuffed with that infuriating mixture of panic and arrogance. It was plain\nenough that he had never set an ambush for a goat before, let alone for Gurkish\nscouts. But still he pretended he knew best. 'Do you see anything?' he hissed at her,\nfor the fifth time in an hour.\n'I see them coming,' Ferro growled back.\n'How many?'\n'Still a dozen.'\n'How far off?'\n'Perhaps quarter of an hour's ride, now, and your asking will not make them\ncome quicker.'\n'When they are in the square, I will give the signal with two claps.'\n'Make sure you do not miss one hand with the other, pink.'\n'I told you not to call me that!'

Her taste did not lean towards taking Gurkish alive. 'We\nwill see.'\nShe turned back to the horizon, and soon enough she heard the sound of Vallimir\nwhispering orders to some of his men. The rest were scattered around the other\nbuildings, hiding. An odd crowd of left-over soldiers. A few were veterans, but most\nof them were even younger and more twitchy than Vallimir himself. Ferro wished,\nand not for the first time, that they had Ninefingers with them. Like him or not, no\none could have denied that the man knew his business. With him, Ferro had known\nwhat she would get. Solid experience or, on occasion, murderous fury. Either one\nwould have been useful.\nBut Ninefingers was not there.\nSo Ferro stood in the wide window of the bell tower, alone, frowning out across\nthe rolling fields of Midderland, and watched the riders come closer. A dozen\nGurkish scouts, trotting in a loose group down a track. Wriggling specks on a pale\nstreak between patchworks of dark earth.\nThey slowed as they passed the first wood-built barn, spreading out. A great\nGurkish host would number soldiers from all across the Empire, fighters from a\nscore of different conquered provinces. These twelve scouts were Kadiris, by their\nlong faces and narrow eyes, their saddlebags of patterned cloth, lightly armed with\nbows and spears. Killing them would not be much vengeance, but it would be some.\nIt would fill the space for now. A space that had been empty far too long.\nOne of them startled as a crow flapped up from a scraggy tree. Ferro held her\nbreath, sure that Vallimir or one of his blundering pinks would choose that moment\nto trip over one another. But there was only silence as the horsemen eased carefully\ninto the village square, their leader with one hand raised for caution. He looked right\nup at her, but saw nothing. Arrogant fools. They saw only what they wanted to see.\nA village from which everyone had fled, crushed with fear of the Emperor's\nmatchless army. Her fist clenched tight around her bow. They would learn.\nShe would teach them.\nThe leader had a square of floppy paper out in his hands, peering at it as though\nit was a message in a language he did not understand. A map, maybe. One of his\nmen reined his horse in and slid from the saddle, took its bridle and led it towards a\nmossy trough. Two more sat loose on their mounts, talking and grinning, moving\ntheir hands, telling jokes. A fourth cleaned his fingernails with a knife. Another rode\nslowly round the edge of the square, leaning from his saddle and peering in through\nthe windows of the houses. Looking for something to steal. One of the joke-tellers\nburst into a deep peal of laughter.\nThen two sharp claps echoed from the buildings.\nThe scout by the trough was just filling his flask when Ferro's shaft sank into his\nchest. The canteen tumbled from his hand, shining drops spilling from the neck."

The canteen tumbled from his hand, shining drops spilling from the neck.\nFlatbows rattled in the windows. Scouts yelled and stared. One horse stumbled\nsideways and fell, puffs of dust rising from its flailing hooves, crushing its rider\nscreaming underneath it.\nUnion soldiers charged from the buildings, shouting, spears ready. One of the\nriders had his sword half-drawn when he was nailed with a flatbow bolt, fell lolling\nfrom the saddle. Ferro's second arrow took another in the back. The one who had\nbeen picking his fingernails was dumped from his horse, stumbled up in time to see a\nUnion soldier coming at him with a spear. He threw down his knife and held his arms\nup too late, was run through anyway, the spear point sticking bloody out of his back\nas he fell.\nTwo of them made a dash the way they had come. Ferro took aim at one, but as\nthey reached the narrow lane a rope was pulled tight across the gap. The pair of\nthem were snatched from their saddles, dragging a Union soldier yelping from a\nbuilding, bouncing along a few strides on his face, rope stuck tight round his arm.\nOne of Ferro's arrows caught a scout between his shoulder-blades as he tried to\npush himself up from the dust. The other dragged himself a groggy few strides\nbefore a Union soldier hit him in the head with a sword and left the back of his skull\nhanging off.\nOf the dozen, only the leader got away from the village. He spurred his horse for\na narrow fence between two buildings, jumping it with hooves clattering against the\ntop rail. He galloped off across the coarse stubble of a harvested field, pressed low\ninto his saddle, jerking his heels into his horse's flanks.\nFerro took a long, slow aim, feeling the smile tugging at the corners of her face.\nAll in a moment she judged the way he was sitting the saddle, the speed of the horse,\nthe height of the tower, felt the wind on her face, the weight of the shaft, the tension\nin the wood, the string biting into her lip. She watched the arrow fly, a spinning black\nsplinter against the grey sky, and the horse rushed forwards to meet it.\nSometimes, God is generous.\nThe leader arched his back and tumbled from the saddle, rolling over and over on\nthe dusty earth, specks of mud and cut stalks flying up around him. His cry of agony\ncame to Ferro's ear a moment later. Her lips curled back further from her teeth.\n'Hah!' She threw the bow over her shoulder, slid down the ladder, vaulted\nthrough the back window and dashed out across the field. Her boots thudded in the\nsoft soil between the clumps of stubble, her hand tightened around the grip of her\nsword.\nThe man mewled in the dirt as he tried to drag himself towards his horse. He got\none desperate finger hooked over the stirrup as he heard Ferro's quick footsteps\nbehind, but fell back with a squeal when he tried to lift himself. He lay on his side as\nshe ran up, the blade hissing angry from its wooden sheath. His eyes rolled towards\nher, wild with pain and fear."

She stood over him, and sunlight glinted on the edge of the curved sword.\n'Give me a reason not to do it,' she found she had said. Strange, that she had said\nit, and to a soldier in the Emperor's army, of all people. In the heat and dust of the\nBadlands of Kanta she had not been in the habit of offering chances. Perhaps\nsomething had changed in her, out there in the wet and ruined west of the world.\nHe stared up for a moment, his lip trembling. 'I…' he croaked, 'my daughters! I\nhave two daughters. I pray to see them married…'\nFerro frowned. She should not have let him start talking. A father, with daughters.\nJust as she had once had a father, been a daughter. This man had done her no harm.\nHe was no more Gurkish than she was. He had not chosen to fight, most likely, or\nhad any choice but to do as the mighty Uthman-ul-Dosht commanded.\n'I will go… I swear to God… I will go back to my wife and my daughters…'\nThe arrow had taken him just under the shoulder and gone clean through,\nsnapped off when he hit the ground. She could see the splintered shaft under his\narm. It had missed his lung, by the way he was talking. It would not kill him. Not\nright away, at least. Ferro could help him onto his horse and he would be gone, with\na chance to live.\nThe scout held up a trembling hand, a spatter of blood on his long thumb.\n'Please… this is not my war I—'\nThe sword carved a deep wound out of his face, through his mouth, splitting his\nlower jaw apart. He made a hissing moan. The next blow cut his head half off. He\nrolled over, dark blood pouring out into the dark earth, clutching at the stubble of the\nshorn crop. The sword broke the back of his skull open and he was still.\nIt seemed that Ferro was not in a merciful mood that day.\nThe butchered scout's horse stared dumbly at her. 'What?' she snapped. Perhaps\nshe had changed, out there in the west, but no one changes that much. One less\nsoldier in Uthman's army was a good thing, wherever he came from. She had no\nneed to make excuses for herself. Especially not to a horse. She grabbed at its bridle\nand gave it a yank.\nVallimir might have been a pink fool, but Ferro had to admit that he had managed\nthe ambush well. Ten scouts lay dead in the village square, their torn clothes flapping\nin the breeze, their blood smeared across the dusty ground.

Not so fearsome now.'\n'These are not Gurkish,' said Ferro. 'Kadiri scouts, pressed into service. They did\nnot want to be here any more than you wanted them here.' The man stared back at\nher, puzzled and annoyed. 'Kanta is full of people. Not everyone with a brown face\nis Gurkish, or prays to their God, or bows to their Emperor.'\n'Most do.'\n'Most have no choice.'\n'They're still the enemy,' he sneered.\n'I did not say we should spare them.' She shouldered past, back through the door\ninto the building with the bell tower. It seemed Vallimir had managed to take a\nprisoner after all. He and some others were clustered nervously around one of the\nscouts, on his knees with his arms bound tightly behind him. He had a bloody graze\ndown one side of his face, staring up with that look that prisoners tend to have.\nScared.\n'Where… is… your… main… body?' Vallimir was demanding.\n'He does not speak your tongue, pink,' snapped Ferro, 'and shouting it will not\nhelp.'\nVallimir looked angrily round at her. 'Perhaps we should have brought someone\nwith us who speaks Kantic,' he said with heavy irony.\n'Perhaps.'\nThere was a long pause, while Vallimir waited for her to say more, but she said\nnothing. Eventually, he gave a long sigh. 'Do you speak Kantic?'\n'Of course.'\n'Then would you be so kind as to ask him some questions for us?'\nFerro sucked her teeth. A waste of her time, but if it had to be done, it was best\ndone quickly. 'What shall I ask him?'\n'Well… how far away the Gurkish army is, how many are in it, what route they\nare taking, you know—'\n'Huh.' Ferro squatted down in front of the prisoner and looked him squarely in\nthe eyes. He stared back, helpless and frightened, no doubt wondering what she was\ndoing with these pinks. She wondered herself.\n'Who are you?' he whispered.\nShe drew her knife and held it up. 'You will answer my questions, or I will kill\nyou with this knife. That is who I am. Where is the Gurkish army?'\nHe licked his lips. 'Perhaps… two days march away, to the south.'\n'How many?'\n'More than I could count. Many thousands. People of the deserts, and the plains,\nand the—'\n'What route are they taking?'\n'I do not know. We were only told to ride to this village, and see whether it was\nempty.' He swallowed, the lump on the front of his sweaty throat bobbing up and\ndown. 'Perhaps my Captain knows more—'\n'Ssss,' hissed Ferro. His Captain would be telling nobody anything now she had\ncarved up his head. 'A lot of them,' she snapped at Vallimir, in common, 'and many\nmore to come, two days' march behind. He does not know their route. What now?'\nVallimir rubbed at the light stubble on his jaw. 'I suppose… we should take him"

Deliver him to the Inquisition.'\n'He knows nothing. He will only slow us down. We should kill him.'\n'He surrendered! To kill him would be no better than murder, war or no war.'\nVallimir beckoned to one of the soldiers. 'I won't have that on my conscience.'\n'I will.' Ferro's knife slid smoothly into the scout's heart, and out. His mouth and\nhis eyes opened up very wide. Blood bubbled through the split cloth on his chest,\nspread out quickly in a dark ring. He gawped at it, making a long sucking sound.\n'Glugh…' His head dropped back, his body sagged. She turned to see the\nsoldiers staring at her, pale faces puffed up with shock. A busy day for them,\nmaybe. A lot to learn, but they would soon get used to it.\nThat, or the Gurkish would kill them.\n'They want to burn your farms, and your towns, and your cities. They want to\nmake slaves of your children. They want everyone in the world to pray to God in the\nsame way they do, with the same words they use, and for your land to be a province\nof their Empire. I know this.' Ferro wiped the blade of her knife on the sleeve of the\ndead man's tunic. 'The only difference between war and murder is the number of the\ndead.'\nVallimir stared down at the corpse of his prisoner for a moment, his lips\nthoughtfully pursed. Ferro wondered if he had more backbone than she had given\nhim credit for. Finally, he turned towards her. 'What do you suggest?'\n'We could wait for more here. Perhaps even get some real Gurkish this time. But\nthat might mean too many for we few.'\n'So?'\n'East, or north, and set another trap like this one.'\n'And defeat the Emperor's army a dozen men at a time? Small steps.'\nFerro shrugged. 'Small steps in the right direction. Unless you've seen enough,\nand want to go back to your walls.'\nVallimir gave her a long frown, then he turned to one of his men, a heavy-built\nveteran with a scar on his cheek. 'There is a village just east of here, is there not,\nSergeant Forest?'\n'Yes, sir. Marlhof is no more than ten miles distant.'\n'Will that suit you?' asked Vallimir, raising one eyebrow at Ferro.\n'Dead Gurkish suit me. That is all.'\nLeaves on the Water\n« ^ »\n'Carleon,' said Logen. 'Aye,' said Dogman. It squatted there, in the fork of the river,\nunder the brooding clouds. Hard shapes of tall walls and towers on the sheer bluff\nabove the fast-flowing water, up where Skarling's hall used to stand. Slate roofs and\nstone buildings squashed in tight on the long downward slope, clustered in round the\nfoot of the hill and with another wall outside, everything leant a cold, sharp shine\nfrom the rain just finished falling.

Every visit yet had turned out badly.\n'It's changed some, since the battle, all them years ago.' Logen was looking down\nat his spread-out hand, waggling the stump of his missing finger.\n'There weren't no walls like that round it then.'\n'No. But there weren't no Union army round it neither.'\nDogman couldn't deny it was a comforting fact. The Union pickets worked their\nway through the empty fields about the city, a wobbly line of earthworks, and stakes,\nand fences, with men moving behind 'em, dull sunlight catching metal now and then.\nThousands of men, well-armed and vengeful, keeping Bethod penned up.\n'You sure he's in there?'\n'Don't see where else he's got to go. He lost most of his best boys up in the\nmountains. No friends left, I reckon.'\n'We've all got less than we used to,' Dogman muttered. 'I guess we just sit here.\nWe got time, after all. Lots of it. We sit here and watch the grass grow, and we wait\nfor Bethod to give up.'\n'Aye.' But Logen didn't look like he believed it.\n'Aye,' said Dogman. But just giving up didn't sound much like the Bethod he\nknew.\nHe turned his head at the sound of hooves fast on the road, saw one of those\nmessengers with a helmet like an angry chicken race from the trees and towards\nWest's tent, horse well-lathered from hard riding. He reined up in a fumbling hurry,\nnear fell out of his saddle in his rush to get down, wobbled past a few staring\nofficers and in through the flap. Dogman felt that familiar weight of worry in his gut.\n'That's got the taste o' bad news.'\n'What other kind is there?'\nThere was some flutter down there now, soldiers shouting, throwing their arms\naround. 'Best go and see what's happened,' muttered Dogman, though he'd much\nrather have walked the other way. Crummock was stood near the tent, frowning at\nthe commotion.\n'Something's up,' said the hillman. 'But I don't understand a thing these\nSoutherners say or do. I swear, they're all mad.'\nMad chatter came surging out of that tent alright, when Dogman pushed back the\nflap. There were Union officers all around the place and in a bastard of a muddle.\nWest was in the midst of it, face pale as fresh milk, his fists clenched tight around\nnothing.\n'Furious!' Dogman grabbed him by the arm. 'What the hell's happening?'\n'The Gurkish have invaded Midderland.' West pulled his arm free and took to\nshouting.\n'The who have done what now?' muttered Crummock.\n'The Gurkish.' Logen was frowning deep. 'Brown folk, from way down south.\nHard folk, by all accounts.'\nPike had come up now, his burned face grim. 'They landed an army by sea. They\nmight have reached Adua already.'"

Dogman didn't know a thing about Gurkish, or Adua, or\nMidderland, but his bad feeling was getting worse every moment. 'What're you\ntelling us, exactly?'\n'We've been ordered home. Now.'\nDogman stared. He should've known all along it couldn't be this simple. He\ngrabbed West by the arm again, stabbing down towards Carleon with his dirty\nfinger. 'We've nothing like the men we need to carry on a siege o' this place without\nyou!'\n'I know,' said West, 'and I'm sorry. But there's nothing I can do. Get over to\nGeneral Poulder!' he snapped at a young lad with a squint. 'Tell him to get his\ndivision ready to march for the coast at once!'\nDogman blinked, feeling sick to his stomach. 'So we fought seven days in the\nHigh Places for nothing? Tul died, and the dead know how many more, for nothing?'\nIt always took him by surprise, how fast something could fall apart once you were\nleaning on it. 'That's it, then. Back to woods, and cold, and running, and killing. No\nend to it.'\n'Might be another way,' said Crummock.\n'What way?'\nThe chief of the hillmen had a sly grin. 'You know, don't you Bloody-Nine?'\n'Aye. I know.' Logen had a look like a man who knows he's about to hang, and\nhe's staring at the tree they're going to do it from. 'When have you got to leave,\nFurious?'\nWest frowned. 'We have a lot of men and not a lot of road. Poulder's division\ntomorrow, I imagine, and Kroy's the day after.'\nCrummock's grin got a shade wider. 'So all day tomorrow, there'll be piles o' men\nsat here, dug in round Bethod, looking like they're never going nowhere, eh?'\n'I suppose there could be.'\n'Give me tomorrow,' said Logen. 'Give me just that and maybe I can settle things.\nThen I'll come south with you if I'm still alive, and bring who I can. That's my word.\nWe'll help you with the Gurkish.'\n'What difference can one day make?' asked West.\n'Aye,' muttered Dogman, 'what's one day?' Trouble was, he could already guess\nthe answer.\nWater trickled under the old bridge, past the trees and off down the green hillside.\nDown towards Carleon. Logen watched a few yellow leaves carried on it, turning\nround and round, dragged past the mossy stones. He wished that he could just float\naway, but it didn't seem likely.\n'We fought here,' said the Dogman. 'Threetrees and Tul, Dow and Grim, and me.\nForley's buried in them woods somewhere.'\n'You want to go up there?' asked Logen. 'Give him a visit, see if—'\n'What for? I doubt a visit'll do me any good, and I'm damn sure it won't do him\nany. Nothing will. That's what it is to be dead. You sure about this, Logen?'"

'Can't think of too many people who place much value\non that. You coming down?'\nDogman shook his head. 'Reckon I'll stay up here. I had a belly full o' Bethod.'\n'Alright then. Alright.' It was as if all the moments of Logen's life, things said and\nthings done, choices he hardly remembered making, had led him to this. Now there\nwas no choice at all. Maybe there never had been. He was like the leaves on the\nwater—carried along, down towards Carleon, and nothing he could do about it. He\ngave his heels to his horse and off down the slope alone, down the dirt track, beside\nthe gurgling stream.\nEverything seemed picked out clearer than usual, as the day wore down. He rode\npast trees, damp leaves getting ready to fall— golden yellow, burning orange, vivid\npurple, all the colours of fire. Down towards the valley bottom through the heavy air,\njust a trace of autumn mist to it, sharp in his throat. The sounds of saddle creaking,\nharness rattling, hoofbeats in the soft ground all came muffled. He trotted through\nthe empty fields, turned mud pocked with weeds, past the Union pickets, a ditch and\na line of sharpened stakes, three times bowshot from the walls. Soldiers there, in\nstudded jackets and steel caps, watched him pass with frowns on their faces.\nHe pulled on the reins and slowed his horse to a walk. He clattered over a\nwooden bridge, one of Bethod's new ones, the river underneath surging with the\nautumn rain. Up the gentle rise, the wall looming over him. High, sheer, dark and\nsolid looking. A threatening piece of wall if ever there'd been one. He couldn't see\nmen at the slots in the battlements, but he guessed they had to be there. He\nswallowed, spit moving awkward in his throat, then made himself sit up tall,\npretending he wasn't cut and aching all over from seven days of battle in the\nmountains. He wondered if he was about to hear a flatbow click, feel the stab of pain\nthen drop into the mud, dead. Some kind of an embarrassing song that would make.\n'Well, well, well!' came a deep voice, and Logen knew it right away. Who else\nwould it be but Bethod?\nThe strange thing was that he was glad to hear it, for the quickest moment. Until\nhe remembered all the blood between them. Until he remembered they hated each\nother. You can have enemies you never really meet, Logen had plenty. You can kill\nmen you don't know, he'd done it often. But you can't truly hate a man without\nloving him first, and there's always a trace of that love left over.\n'I'm taking a look down from my gates and who should ride up out of the past?'"

The challenges he'd made, and their outcomes, and there were no\nhappy memories among that lot. Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say he's\nreluctant. But there was no other way. 'I'm here to make a challenge!' he bellowed,\nand the sound of it echoed back from the damp, dark walls and died a slow death in\nthe misty air.\nBethod tipped back his head and laughed. A laugh without much joy in it, Logen\nreckoned. 'By the dead, Ninefingers, but you never change. You're like some old\ndog no one can stop from barking. Challenge? What have we got left to fight over?'\n'I win, you open the gates and belong to me. My prisoner. I lose, the Union pack\nup and sail for home, and you're free.'\nBethod's smile slowly faded and his eyes narrowed, suspicious. Logen knew that\nlook from way back. Turning over the chances, sorting through the reasons why.\n'That sounds like a golden offer, considering the fix I'm in. Hard to believe it. What's\nin it for your Southern friends up there?'\nLogen snorted. 'They'll wait, if they have to, but they don't much care about you,\nBethod. You're nothing to them, for all your bluster. They kicked your arse across\nthe North already and they reckon you'll not be bothering them again either way. If I"

Are you happy, Ninefingers? To see all I've\nfought for put in the dust?'\n'Why shouldn't I be? You've no one but yourself to blame for it. It was you\nbrought us to this. Take my challenge, Bethod, then maybe one of us can have\npeace!'\nThe King of the Northmen gaped down, eyes wide. 'No one else to blame? Me?\nHow soon we all forget!' He grabbed the chain round his shoulders and rattled it.\n'You think I wanted this? You think I asked for any of it? All I wanted was a strip\nmore land to feed my people, to stop the big clans squeezing me. All I wanted was\nto win a few victories to be proud of, to pass on something better to my sons than I\ngot from my father.' He leaned forward, his hands clutching at the battlements. 'Who\nwas it always had to push a step further? Who was it would never let me stop? Who\nwas it had to taste blood, and once he'd tasted it got drunk on it, went mad with it,\ncould never get enough?' His finger stabbed down. 'Who else but the Bloody-Nine?'\n'That's not how it was,' growled Logen.\nBethod's laughter echoed harsh on the wind. 'Is it not? I wanted to talk with\nShama Heartless, but you had to kill him! I tried to strike a deal at Heonan, but you\nhad to climb up and settle your score, and start a dozen more! Peace, you say? I\nbegged you to let me make peace at Uffrith, but you had to fight Threetrees! On my\nknees I begged you, but you had to have the biggest name in all the North! Then\nonce you'd beaten him, you broke your word to me and let him live, as though there\nwas nothing bigger to think about than your damn pride!'\n'That's not how it was,' said Logen.\n'There's not a man in the North that doesn't know the truth of it! Peace? Hah!\nWhat about Rattleneck, eh? I would have ransomed his son back to him, and we\ncould all have gone home happy, but no! What did you say to me? Easier to stop the\nWhiteflow than to stop the Bloody-Nine! Then you had to nail his head to my\nstandard for the whole world to see, so the vengeance would never find an end!\nEvery time I tried to stop, you dragged me on, deeper and deeper into the mire! Until\nthere could be no stopping any longer! Until it was kill or be killed! Until I had to put\ndown the whole North! You made me King, Ninefingers. What other choices did\nyou leave me?'\n'That's not how it was,' whispered Logen. But he knew it had been.\n'Tell yourself that I'm the cause of all your woes if it makes you happy! Tell"

Tell\nyourself I'm the merciless one, the murderous one, the bloodthirsty one, but ask\nyourself who I learned it from. I had the best master! Play at being the good man if\nyou please, the man with no choices, but we both know what you really are. Peace?\nYou'll never have peace, Bloody-Nine. You're made of death!'\nLogen would've liked to deny it, but it would just have been more lies. Bethod\ntruly knew him. Bethod truly understood him. Better than anyone. His worst enemy,\nand still his best friend. 'Then why not kill me, when you had the chance?'\nThe King of the Northmen frowned, as though he couldn't understand something.\nThen he started to laugh again. He shrieked with it. 'You don't know why? You\nstood right beside him and you don't know? You learned nothing from me,\nNinefingers! After all these years, you still let the rain wash you any way it pleases!'\n'What're you saying?' snarled Logen.\n'Bayaz!'\n'Bayaz? What of him?'\n'I was ready to put the bloody cross in you, sink your carcass in a bog with all\nthe rest of your misfit idiots and was happy to do it, until that old liar came calling!'\n'And?'\n'I owed him, and he wanted you let go. It was that meddling old fuck that saved\nyour worthless hide, and nothing else!'\n'Why?' growled Logen, not knowing what to make of it, but not liking that he was\nlearning about it so long after everyone else.\nBut Bethod only chuckled. 'Maybe I didn't grovel low enough for his taste.\nYou're the one he saved, you ask him the whys, if you live long enough. But I don't\nthink you will. I take your challenge! Here. Tomorrow. At sunrise.' He rubbed his\npalms together. 'Man against man, with the future of the North hanging bloody on the\noutcome! Just as it used to be, eh, Logen? In the old days? In the sunny valleys of\nthe past? Roll the dice together one more time, shall we?' The King of the Northmen\nstepped slowly back, away from the battlements. 'Some things have changed,\nthough. I've a new champion now! If I was you, I'd say your goodbyes tonight, and\nget ready for the mud! After all… what was it you used to tell me… ?' His laughter\nfaded slowly into the dusk. 'You have to be realistic!'\n'Good piece o' meat,' said Grim.\nA warm fire and a good piece of meat were two things to be thankful for, and\nthere'd been times enough when Dogman had a lot less, but watching the blood drip\nfrom that chunk of mutton was making him feel sick. Reminded him of the blood\nthat came out of Shama Heartless when Logen split him open. Years ago, maybe,\nbut the Dogman could see it fresh as yesterday. He could hear the roars from the\nmen, the shields crashing together. He could smell the sour sweat and the fresh\nblood on the snow."

He could smell the sour sweat and the fresh\nblood on the snow.\n'By the dead,' grunted Dogman, mouth watering like he was about to puke. 'How\ncan you think about eating now?'\nDow gave a toothy grin. 'Us going hungry ain't going to help Ninefingers any.\nNothing is. That's the point of a duel, ain't it? All about one man.' He poked at the\nmeat with his knife and made the blood run sizzling into the fire. Then he sat back,\nthoughtful. 'You reckon he can do it? Really? You remember that thing?' Dogman\nfelt a ghost of the sick fear he'd had in the mist, and he shuddered to his boots. He\nweren't likely ever to forget the sight of that giant coming through the murk, the sight\nof his painted fist rising, the sound of it crunching into Threetrees' ribs and crushing\nthe life out of him.\n'If anyone can do it,' he growled through his gritted teeth, 'I reckon Logen can.'\n'Uh,' grunted Grim.\n'Aye, but do you think he will? That's my question. That, and what happens if he\ndon't?' It was a question that Dogman could hardly bear to think up an answer to.\nLogen would be dead, for a first thing. Then there'd be no siege of Carleon\nanymore. Dogman had too few men left after the mountains to keep a piss-pot\nsurrounded, let alone the best walled city in the North. Bethod could do as he\npleased—seek out help, and find new friends, and set to fighting again. There was\nno one tougher in a tight corner.\n'Logen can do it,' he whispered, bunching his fists and feeling the long cut down\nhis arm burning. 'He has to.'\nHe nearly fell in the fire when a great fat hand thumped him on the back. 'By the\ndead but I never seen such a fire-full o' long faces!' Dogman winced. The crazy\nhillman was hardly what he needed to lift his mood, grinning out of the night with his\nchildren behind him, great big weapons over their shoulders.\nCrummock was down to just the two now, since one of his sons got killed up in\nthe mountains, but he didn't seem so upset about it. He'd lost his spear too, snapped\noff in some Easterner, as he was fond of saying, so he still didn't have to carry aught\nhimself. Neither one of the children had said much since the battle, or not in the\nDogman's hearing, anyway. No more talk about how many men folk might've killed.\nThe seeing of it close up could be a woeful drain on your enthusiasm for the\nbusiness of war. Dogman knew well enough how that went.\nBut Crummock himself had no trouble keeping cheerful. 'Where's Ninefingers got\nhimself off to?'\n'Gone off on his own. Always liked to do that, before a duel.'\n'Mmm.' Crummock stroked at the fingerbones round his neck. 'Speaking to the\nmoon, I'll be bound.'\n'Shitting himself is closer to it, I reckon.'"

'Speaking to the\nmoon, I'll be bound.'\n'Shitting himself is closer to it, I reckon.'\n'Well, as long as you get the shitting done before the fight, I don't reckon anyone\ncould grumble.' He grinned all across his face. 'No one's loved of the moon like the\nBloody-Nine, I tell you! No one in all the wide Circle of the World. He's got some\nkind of chance at winning a fair fight, and that's the best a man could hope for\nagainst that devil-thing. There's only one problem.'\n'Just one?'\n'There'll be no fair fight as long as that damn witch is alive.'\nThe Dogman felt his shoulders slump even further. 'How d'you mean?'\nCrummock spun one of the wooden signs on his necklace round and around. 'I\ncan't see her letting Bethod lose, and herself along with him, can you? A witch as\nclever as that one? There's all kinds of magic she could mix. All kinds of blessings\nand curses. All kinds of ways that bitch could tilt the outcome, as though the\nchances weren't tilted enough already.'\n'Eh?'\n'My point is this. Someone needs to stop her.'\nDogman hadn't thought he could feel any lower. Now he knew better. 'Good luck\nwith that,' he muttered.\n'Ha ha, my lad, ha ha. I'd love to do it, too, but they've got an awful stretch of\nwalls down there, and I'm not much for climbing over 'em.' Crummock slapped one\nfat hand against his fat belly. 'Twice too much meat for that. No, what we need for\nthis task is a small man, but with great big fruits on him. No doubt we do, and the\nmoon knows it. A man with a talent for creeping about, sharp-eyed and sure-footed.\nWe need someone with a quick hand and a quick mind.' He looked at the Dogman,\nand he grinned. 'Now where is it that we'd find a man like that, do you reckon?'\n'You know what?' Dogman put his face in his hands. 'I've no fucking idea.'\nLogen lifted the battered flask to his lips and took a mouthful. He felt the sharp\nliquor tingling on his tongue, tickling at his throat, that old need to swallow. He\nleaned forward, pursed his lips, and blew it out in a fine spray. A gout of fire went\nup into the cold night. He peered into the darkness, saw nothing but the black\noutlines of tree-trunks, the shifting black shadows that his fire cast between them.\nHe shook the flask back and forth, heard the last measure sloshing inside. He\nshrugged his shoulders, put it to his mouth and tipped it all the way, felt it burn down\nto his stomach. The spirits could share with him tonight. Chances were good that,\nafter tomorrow, he wouldn't be calling on them again.\n'Ninefingers.' The voice rustled at him like the leaves falling.\nOne spirit slid out from the shadows, came up into the light from the fire.

There was no\naccusation either, no fear and no distrust. It didn't care what he was, or what he'd\ndone.\nLogen tossed the empty flask down beside him. 'On your own?'\n'Yes.'\n'Well, you're never alone if you bring laughter with you.' The spirit said nothing.\n'Reckon laughter's a thing for men, not for spirits.'\n'Yes.'\n'Don't speak much, do you?'\n'I did not call on you.'\n'True.' Logen stared into the fire. 'I have to fight a man tomorrow. A man called\nFenris the Feared.'\n'He is not a man.'\n'You know of him, then?'\n'He is old.'\n'By your reckoning?'\n'Nothing is old by my reckoning, but he goes back to the Old Time and beyond.\nHe had another master, then.'\n'What master?'\n'Glustrod.'\nThe name was like a knife in the ear. No name could've been less expected, or\nless welcome. The wind blew cold through the trees, and memories of the towering\nruins of Aulcus crowded in on Logen, and made his back shiver. 'No chance it's\nsome different Glustrod than the one came close to destroying half the world?'\n'There is no other. He it was that wrote the signs upon the Feared's skin. Signs in\nthe Old Tongue, the language of devils, across his left side. That flesh is of the\nworld below. Where the word of Glustrod is written, the Feared cannot be harmed.'\n'Cannot be harmed? Not at all?' Logen thought about it a moment. 'Why not write\non both sides?'\n'Ask Glustrod.'\n'I don't think that's likely.'\n'No.' A long pause. 'What will you do, Ninefingers?'\nLogen peered off sideways into the trees. The notion of setting off running, and\nnever looking back, seemed a pretty one, right then. Sometimes it can be better to\nlive with the fear of it, than to die doing it, whatever Logen's father had told him.\n'I ran before,' he muttered, 'and I only ran a circle. For me, Bethod's at the end of\nevery path.'\n'Then that is all our talk.' The spirit stood up from the fire.\n'Perhaps I'll see you again.'\n'I do not think so. The magic leaks from the world, and my kind sleep. I do not\nthink so. Even if you beat the Feared, and I do not think you will.'\n'Message o' hope then, eh?' Logen snorted. 'Luck go with you.'\nThe spirit faded back into the darkness, and was gone. It did not wish Logen\nluck. It did not care.\nAuthority\n« ^ »\nIt was a dour and depressing meeting, even for the Closed Council. The weather\nbeyond the narrow windows was sullen and overcast, promising storms but never\ndelivering, casting the White Chamber into a chill gloom.

Lord\nMarshal Varuz was all clenched jaw and harsh determination. Lord Chamberlain Hoff\nclutched his goblet like a drowning man clinging to the last fragment of his boat.\nHigh Justice Marovia frowned as though he were about to pronounce the death\nsentence on the entire gathering, himself among them. Arch Lector Sult's thin lip was\npermanently curled as his cold eyes slid from Bayaz, to Jezal, to Marovia, and back.\nThe First of the Magi himself glared down the table. 'The situation, please, Lord\nMarshal Varuz.'\n'The situation, honestly, is grim. Adua is in uproar. Perhaps one third of the\npopulation has already fled. The Gurkish blockade means that few supplies are\nmaking it to the markets. Curfews are in place but some citizens are still seizing the\nopportunity to rob, steal and riot while the authorities are occupied elsewhere.'\nMarovia shook his head, grey beard swaying gently. 'And we can only expect the\nsituation to deteriorate as the Gurkish come closer to the city.'\n'Which they are,' said Varuz, 'at the rate of several miles a day. We are doing all\nwe can to frustrate them, but with our resources so limited… they may well be\noutside the gates within the week.'\nThere were a few shocked gasps, breathed oaths, nervous sideways glances. 'So\nsoon?' Jezal's voice cracked slightly as he said it.\n'I am afraid so, your Majesty.'\n'What is the Gurkish strength?' asked Marovia.\n'Estimates vary wildly. At present however…' and Varuz sucked worriedly at his\nteeth, 'it appears they field at least fifty thousand.'\nThere were further sharp intakes of breath, not least from Jezal's own throat. 'So\nmany?' muttered Halleck.\n'And thousands more landing every day near Keln,' put in Admiral Reutzer, doing\nnothing to lift the mood. 'With the best part of our navy on its way to retrieve the\narmy after its northern adventure, we are powerless to stop them.'\nJezal licked his lips. The walls of the wide room seemed to close in further with\nevery moment. 'What of our troops?'\nVaruz and Reutzer exchanged a brief glance. 'We have two regiments of the\nKing's Own, one of foot and one of horse, some six thousand men in all. The Grey\nWatch, tasked with the defence of the Agriont itself, numbers four thousand. The\nKnights Herald and of the Body form an elite of some five hundred. In addition,\nthere are non-combat soldiers—cooks, grooms, smiths, and so forth—who could\nbe armed in an emergency—'\n'I believe this qualifies,' observed Bayaz.\n'—perhaps some few thousand more. The city watch might be of some use, but\nthey are hardly professional soldiers.'\n'What of the nobles?' asked Marovia. 'Where is their aid?'\n'Some few have sent men,' said Varuz grimly, 'others only their regrets. Most…\nnot even that.'"

Hoff shook his head. 'Brock has let it be known there will be\nGurkish gold for those who help him, and Gurkish mercy for those who stand with\nus.'\n'It has ever been so,' lamented Torlichorm. 'The nobles are interested only in their\nown welfare!'\n'Then we must open the armouries,' said Bayaz, 'and we must not be shy with\ntheir contents. We must arm every citizen who can hold a weapon. We must arm the\nlabourers' guilds, and the craftsmens' guilds, and the veterans' associations. Even the\nbeggars in the gutters must be ready to fight.'\nAll well and good, Jezal supposed, but he hardly cared to trust his life to a legion\nof beggars. 'When will Lord Marshal West return with the army?'\n'If he received his orders yesterday, it will be a month at the very least before he\nis disembarked and ready to come to our aid.'\n'Which means we must withstand several weeks of siege,' muttered Hoff, shaking\nhis head. He leaned close to Jezal's ear and spoke softly, quite as if they were\nschoolgirls trading secrets. 'Your Majesty, it might be prudent for you and your\nClosed Council to leave the city. To relocate your government further north, outside\nthe path of the Gurkish advance, where the campaign can be conducted in greater\nsafety. To Holsthorm, perhaps, or—'\n'Absolutely not,' said Bayaz sternly.\nJezal could scarcely deny that the notion held its attractions. The island of\nShabulyan at that moment seemed an ideal place to relocate his government to—but\nBayaz was right. Harod the Great would hardly have entertained the idea of retreat,\nand neither, unfortunately, could Jezal.\n'We will fight the Gurkish here,' he said.\n'Merely a suggestion,' muttered Hoff, 'merely prudence.'\nBayaz spoke over him. 'How do the defences of the city stand?'\n'We have, in essence, three concentric lines of defence. The Agriont itself is, of\ncourse, our last bastion.'\n'It will not come to that, though, eh?' chuckled Hoff, with far from total\nconviction.\nVaruz decided not to answer. 'Arnault's Wall is beyond it, enclosing the oldest\nand most crucial parts of the city—the Agriont, the Middleway, the main docks and\nthe Four Corners among them. Casamir's Wall is our outermost line of\ndefence—weaker, lower, and a great deal longer than Arnault's. Smaller walls run\nbetween these two, like the spokes of a wheel, dividing the outer ring of the city into\nfive boroughs, each of which can be sealed off, should it be captured by the enemy.\nThere are some built-up areas beyond Casamir's Wall, but those must be\nimmediately abandoned.'\nBayaz planted his elbows on the edge of the table, his meaty fists clasped\ntogether.

'Your Majesty?'\nBut Jezal refused to be overawed. It had been becoming clear for some time that\nif he allowed the Magus to rule him on every issue then he would never escape from\nunder his boot. He might have seen Bayaz make a man explode with a thought, but\nhe was hardly likely to do it to the King of the Union before his own Closed Council.\nNot with the Gurkish breathing down all their necks.\n'I do not intend to give up the greater part of my capital to the Union's oldest\nenemy without giving battle. We will defend Casamir's Wall, and fight for every\nstride of ground.'\nVaruz glanced across at Hoff, and the Chamberlain raised his eyebrows by the\ntiniest fraction. 'Er… of course, your Majesty. Every stride.' There was an\nuncomfortable silence, the displeasure of the First of the Magi hanging over the\ngroup as heavily as the storm clouds hung over the city.\n'Does my Inquisition have anything to contribute?' croaked Jezal, doing his best\nto mount a diversion.\nSult's eyes darted coldly up to his. 'Of course, your Majesty. The Gurkish love\nof intrigue is well known. We have no doubt that there are already spies within the\nwalls of Adua. Perhaps within the Agriont itself. All citizens of Kantic origin are now\nbeing interned. My Inquisitors are working day and night in the House of Questions.\nSeveral spies have already confessed.'\nMarovia snorted. 'So we are expected to suppose that the Gurkish love of\nintrigue does not extend to the hiring of white-skinned agents?'\n'We are at war!' hissed Sult, giving the High Justice a deadly glare. 'The very\nsovereignty of our nation is at risk! This is no time for your blather about freedom,\nMarovia!'\n'On the contrary, this is precisely the time!'\nThe two old men bickered on, straining everyone's frayed nerves to breaking\npoint. Bayaz, meanwhile, had sunk back into his chair and folded his arms, watching\nJezal with an expression of calm consideration which was, if anything, even more\nfearsome than his frown. Jezal felt the worry weighing ever heavier upon him.\nHowever you looked at things, he was teetering on the verge of having the briefest\nand most disastrous reign in Union history.\n'I am sorry that I had to send for your Majesty,' piped Gorst, in his girlish little\nvoice.\n'Of course, of course.' The clicking of Jezal's polished boot-heels echoed angrily\naround them.\n'There is only so much that I can do.'\n'Of course.'\nJezal shoved open the double doors with both hands.

As though he were an insect in\nher salad. Several Styrian ladies looked up, and then back to their tasks. Chests and\nboxes cluttered the room, clothes were being neatly packed within. Every impression\nwas given that the Queen of the Union was planning to leave the capital, and without\nso much as informing her husband.\nJezal ground his already aching teeth. He was tormented by a disloyal Closed\nCouncil, a disloyal Open Council, and a disloyal populace. The poisonous disloyalty\nof his wife was almost too much to bear. 'What the hell is this?'\n'I and my ladies can hardly assist you in your war with the Emperor.' Terez\nturned her flawless head smoothly away from him. 'We are returning to Talins.'\n'Impossible!' hissed Jezal. 'A Gurkish army of many thousands is bearing down\nupon the city!

I cannot allow it!'\n'Her Majesty is in no way involved!' snapped the Countess Shalere, gliding\nacross the polished floor towards him.\nAs though Jezal had not enough to worry about with the Queen herself, he was\nnow obliged to bandy words with her companions.

'You\nforget that you are a bastard son, and a scarred one at—'\nThe back of Jezal's hand cracked sharply into her sneering mouth and sent her\nreeling back with an ungainly gurgle.

I refuse to be spoken to in this manner by a\nglorified lady's maid.' The voice came out, flat, cold, and frighteningly commanding.\nIt scarcely sounded like his own, but who else's could it be? He was the only man in\nthe room. 'I see that I have been far too generous with you, and that you have\nmistaken my generosity for weakness.' The eleven ladies stared at him, and at their\nfallen comrade, crumpled on the ground with one hand to her bloody mouth. 'If any\nof your witches should desire to depart these troubled shores, I will arrange passage\nfor them, and even pull an oar myself with a light heart. But you, your Majesty, will\nbe going nowhere.'\nTerez had leaped up from her seat and was glowering at him, body rigid. 'You\nheartless brute—' she began to hiss.\n'We may both wholeheartedly wish it were otherwise!' he roared over her, 'but we\nare married!

Despise me\nall you wish, Terez, but you… go… nowhere.' And Jezal swept the dumbstruck\nladies with a baleful glare, turned on his polished heel and stalked from the airy\nsalon.\nDamn it but his hand hurt.\nThe Circle\n« ^ »\nDawn was coming, a grey rumour, the faintest touch of brightness around the\nsolemn outline of the walls of Carleon. The stars had all faded into a stony sky, but\nthe moon still hung there, just above the tree-tops, seeming almost close enough to\ntry an arrow at.\nWest had not closed his eyes all night, and had passed into that strange realm of\ntwitchy, dreamlike wakefulness that comes beyond exhaustion. Some time in the\nsilent darkness, after all the orders had been given, he had sat by the light of a single\nlamp to write a letter to his sister. To vomit up excuses. To demand forgiveness. He\nhad sat, he could not have said for how long, with the pen over the paper, but the\nwords had simply not come. He had wanted to say all that he felt, but when it came\nto it, he felt nothing. The warm taverns of Adua, cards in the sunny courtyard.\nArdee's one-sided smile. It all seemed a thousand years ago.\nThe Northmen were already busy, clipping at the grass in the shadow of the\nwalls, the clicking of their shears a strange echo of the gardeners in the Agriont,\nshaving a circle a dozen strides across down to the roots. The ground, he supposed,\non which the duel would take place. The ground where, in no more than an hour or\ntwo, the fate of the North would be decided. Very much like a fencing circle, except\nthat it might soon be sprayed with blood.\n'A barbaric custom,' muttered Jalenhorm, his thoughts evidently taking a similar\ncourse.\n'Really?' growled Pike. 'I was just now thinking what a civilised one it is.'\n'Civilised? Two men butchering each other before a crowd?'\n'Better than a whole crowd butchering each other. A problem solved with only\none man killed? That's a war ended well, to my mind.'\nJalenhorm shivered and blew into his cupped hands. 'Still. A lot to hang on two\nmen fighting one another. What if Ninefingers loses?'\n'Then I suppose that Bethod will go free,' said West, unhappily.\n'But he invaded the Union! He caused the deaths of thousands! He deserves to\nbe punished!'\n'People rarely get what they deserve.' West thought of Prince Ladisla's bones\nrotting out in the wasteland. Some terrible crimes go unpunished, and a few, for no\nreason beyond the fickle movements of chance, are richly rewarded. He stopped in\nhis tracks.\nA man was sitting on his own on the long slope, his back to the city. A man\nhunched over in a battered coat, so still and quiet in the half-light that West had\nalmost missed him. 'I'll catch you up,' he said as he left the path. The grass, coated"

The grass, coated\nwith a pale fur of frost, crunched gently under his boots with each step.\n'Pull up a chair.' Breath smoked gently round Ninefingers' darkened face.\nWest squatted down on the cold earth beside him. 'Are you ready?'\n'Ten times before I've done this. Can't say I've ever yet been ready. Don't know\nthat there is a way to get ready for a thing like this. The best I've worked out is just\nto sit, and let the time crawl past, and try not to piss yourself.'\n'I imagine a wet crotch could be an embarrassment in the circle.'\n'Aye. Better than a split head, though, I reckon.'\nUndeniably true. West had heard tales of these Northern duels before, of course.\nGrowing up in Angland, children whispered lurid stories of them to each other. But\nhe had little idea how they were really conducted. 'How does this business work?'\n'They mark out a circle. Round the edge men stand with shields, half from one\nside, half from the other, and they make sure no one leaves before it's settled. Two\nmen go into the circle. The one that dies there is the loser. Unless someone has it in\nmind to be merciful. Can't see that happening today, though, somehow.'\nAlso undeniable. 'What do you fight with?'\n'Each one of us brings something. Could be anything. Then there's a spin of a\nshield, and the winner picks the weapon he wants.'\n'So you might end up fighting with what your enemy brought?'\n'It can happen. I killed Shama Heartless with his own sword, and got stuck\nthrough with the spear I brought to fight Harding Grim.' He rubbed at his stomach,\nas though the memory ached there. 'Still, don't hurt any worse, getting stuck with\nyour own spear instead of someone else's.'\nWest laid a hand thoughtfully on his own gut. 'No.' They sat in silence for a while\nlonger.\n'There's a favour I'd like to ask you.'\n'Name it.'\n'Would you and your friends hold shields for me?'\n'Us?' West blinked towards the Carls in the shadow of the wall. Their great round\nshields looked hard enough to lift, let alone to use well. 'Are you sure? I've never\nheld one in my life.'\n'Maybe, but you know whose side you're on. There ain't many folk among these\nthat I can trust. Most of 'em are still trying to work out who they hate more, me or\nBethod. It only takes one to give me a shove when I need a push, or let me fall when\nI need catching. Then we're all done. Me especially.'\nWest puffed out his cheeks. 'We'll do what we can.'\n'Good. Good.'\nThe cold silence dragged out. Over the black hills, the black trees, the moon sank\nand grew dimmer.\n'Tell me, Furious. Do you reckon a man has to pay for the things he's done?'\nWest looked up sharply, the irrational and sickly thought flashing through his\nmind that Ninefingers was talking of Ardee, or of Ladisla, or both.

Certainly, the\nNorthman's eyes seemed to glint with accusation in the half-light—then West felt the\nsurge of fear subside. Ninefingers was talking of himself, of course, as everyone\nalways does, given the chance. It was guilt in his eyes, not accusation. Each man has\nhis own mistakes to follow him.\n'Maybe.' West cleared his dry throat. 'Sometimes. I don't know. I suppose we've\nall done things we regret.'\n'Aye,' said Ninefingers. 'I reckon.'\nThey sat together in silence, and watched the light leak across the sky.\n'Let's go, chief!' hissed Dow. 'Let's fucking go!'\n'I'll say when!' Dogman spat back, holding the dewy branches out of the way and\npeering towards the walls, a hundred strides off, maybe, across a damp meadow.\n'Too much light, now. We'll wait for that bloody moon to drop a touch further, then\nwe'll make a run at it.'\n'It ain't going to get any darker! Bethod can't have too many men left after all the\nones we killed up in the mountains, and that's a lot o' walls. They'll be spread thin as\ncobwebs up there.'\n'It only takes one to—'\nAnd Dow was off across that field and running, as plain on the flat grass as a turd\non a snow-field.\n'Shit!' hissed Dogman, helpless.\n'Uh,' said Grim.\nThere was nothing to do but stare, and wait for Dow to get stuck full of arrows.\nWait for the shouts, and torches lit, and the alarm to go up, and the whole thing\ndumped right in the shit-hole. Then Dow dashed up the last bit of slope and was\ngone into the shadows by the wall.\n'He made it,' said Dogman.\n'Uh,' said Grim.\nThat ought to have been a good thing, but Dogman didn't feel too much like\nlaughing. He had to make the run himself now, and he didn't have Dow's luck. He\nlooked at Grim, and Grim shrugged. They burst out from the trees together, feet\npounding across the soft meadow. Grim had the longer legs, started pulling away.\nThe ground was a good deal softer than Dogman had—\n'Gah!' His foot squelched to the ankle and he went flying over, splashed down in\nthe mire and slid along on his face. He floundered up, cold and gasping, ran the rest\nof the way with his wet shirt plastered against his skin. He stumbled up the slope to\nthe foot of the walls and bent over, hands to his knees, blowing hard and spitting out\ngrass.\n'Looks like you took a tumble there, chief.' Dow's grin was a white curve in the\nshadows.\n'You mad bastard!' hissed Dogman, his temper flaring up hot in his cold chest.\n'You could've been the deaths of all of us!'\n'Oh, there's still time.'\n'Shhhh.'

        "text": "'Oh, there's still time.'\n'Shhhh.' Grim flailed one hand at them to say keep quiet. Dogman pressed\nhimself tight to the wall, worry snuffing his anger out quick-time. He heard men\nmoving up above, saw the glimmer of a lamp pass slow down the walls. He waited,\nstill, no sound but Dow's quiet breath beside him and his own heart pounding, 'til the\nmen above moved on and all was quiet again.\n'Tell me that ain't got your blood flowing quick, chief,' whispered Dow.\n'We're lucky it ain't flowing right out of us.'\n'What now?'\nDogman gritted his teeth as he tried to scrape the mud out of his face. 'Now we\nwait.'\nLogen stood up, brushed the dew from his trousers, took a long breath of the chill\nair. There could be no denying any longer that the sun was well and truly up. It\nmight've been hidden in the east behind Skarling's Hill, but the tall black towers up\nthere had bright golden edges, the thin, high clouds were pinking underneath, the\ncold sky between turning pale blue.\n'Better to do it,' Logen whispered under his breath, 'than live with the fear of it.'\nHe remembered his father telling him that. Saying it in the smoky hall, light from the\nfire shifting on his lined face, long finger wagging. Logen remembered telling it to his\nown son, smiling by the river, teaching him to tickle fish, Father and son, both dead\nnow, earth and ashes. No one would learn it after Logen, once he was gone. No one\nwould miss him much at all, he reckoned. But then who cared? There's nothing\nworth less than what men think of you after you're back in the mud.\nHe wrapped his fingers round the grip of the Maker's sword, felt the scored lines\ntickling at his palm. He slid it from the sheath and let it hang, worked his shoulders\nround in circles, jerked his head from side to side. One more cold breath in, and out,\nthen he started walking, up through the crowd that had gathered in a wide arc around\nthe gate. A mix of the Dogman's Carls and Crummock's hillmen, and a few Union\nsoldiers given leave to watch the crazy Northerners kill each other. Some called to\nhim as he came through, all knowing there were a lot more lives hanging on this than\nLogen's own.\n'It's Ninefingers!'\n'The Bloody-Nine.'\n'Put an end to this!'\n'Kill that bastard!'\nThey had their shields, all the men that Logen had picked to hold them, standing\nin a solemn knot near the walls. West was one, and Pike, and Red Hat, and Shivers\ntoo. Logen wondered if he'd made a mistake with the last of them, but he'd saved the\nman's life in the mountains and that ought to count for something. Ought to was a\nthin thread to hang your life on, but there it was. His life had been dangling from a\nthin thread ever since he could remember.\nCrummock-i-Phail fell into step beside him, big shield looking small on one big\narm, the other hand resting light on his fat belly. 'You looking forward to this then,\nBloody-Nine? I am, I can tell you that!'"

        "text": "arm, the other hand resting light on his fat belly. 'You looking forward to this then,\nBloody-Nine? I am, I can tell you that!'\nHands slapped at his shoulders, voices called encouragement, but Logen said\nnothing. He didn't look left or right as he pushed past into the shaven circle. He felt\nmen close in behind him, heard them set their shields in a half-ring round the edge of\nthe short grass, facing the gates of Carleon. Further back the crowd pressed in tight.\nWhispering to each other. Straining to see. No way back now, that was a fact. But\nthen there never had been. He'd been heading here all his days. Logen stopped, in\nthe centre of the circle, and he turned his face up towards the battlements.\n'It's sunrise!' he roared. 'Let's get to it!'\nThere was silence, while the echoes died, and the wind pushed some loose leaves\naround the grass. A silence long enough for Logen to start hoping no one would\nanswer. To start hoping they'd all somehow slipped away in the night, and there'd be\nno duel after all.\nThen faces appeared on the walls. One here, one there, then a whole crowd,\nlining the parapet far as Logen could see in both directions. Hundreds of\nfolk—fighting men, women, children even, up on shoulders. Everyone in the city, it\nlooked like. Metal squealed, and wood creaked, and the tall gates ever so slowly\nswung apart, the glare of the rising sun spilling out the crack between, then pouring\nbright through the open archway. Two lines of men came tramping out.\nCarls, all hard faces and tangled hair, heavy mail jingling, painted shields on their\narms.\nLogen knew a few of them. Some of Bethod's closest, who'd been with him since\nthe beginning. Hard men all, who'd held the shields for Logen more than once, back\nin the old days. They formed up in their own half-ring, closing the circle tight. A wall\nof shields—animal faces, trees and towers, flowing water, crossed axes, all of them\nscarred and scuffed from a hundred old fights. All of them turned in towards Logen.\nA cage of men and wood, and the only way out was to kill. Or to die, of course.\nA black shape formed in the bright archway. Like a man, but taller, seeming to fill\nit all the way to the high keystone. Logen heard footsteps. Thumping footsteps,\nheavy as falling anvils. A strange kind of fear tugged at him. A mindless panic, as if\nhe'd woken trapped under the snow again. He forced himself not to look over his\nshoulder at Crummock, forced himself to look ahead as Bethod's champion stepped\nout into the dawn.\n'By the fucking dead,' breathed Logen.\nHe thought at first it must be some trick of the light that made him look the size\nhe did. Tul Duru Thunderhead had been a big bastard, no doubt, big enough that\nsome had called him a giant. But he'd still looked like a man. Fenris the Feared was\nbuilt on such a scale that he seemed something else. A race apart. A giant indeed,\nstepped out from old stories and made flesh. A lot of flesh."

        "text": "built on such a scale that he seemed something else. A race apart. A giant indeed,\nstepped out from old stories and made flesh. A lot of flesh.\nHis face squirmed as he walked, great bald head jerking from side to side. His\nmouth sneered and grinned, his eyes winked and bulged by turns. One half of him\nwas blue. No other way to put it. A neat line down his face divided blue skin from\npale. His huge right arm was white. His left was blue all the long way from shoulder\nto the tips of his great fingers. In that hand he carried a sack, swinging back and\nforward with each step, bulging as if it was stuffed with hammers.\nA couple of Bethod's shield-carriers cringed out of his way, looking like children\nbeside him, grimacing as if death itself was breathing on their necks. The Feared\nstepped through into the circle, and Logen saw the blue marks were writing, just as\nthe spirit had told him. Twisted symbols, scrawled over every part of his left\nside—hand, arm, face, lips even. The words of Glustrod, written in the Old Time.\nThe Feared stopped a few strides distant, and a sickly horror seemed to wash out\nfrom him and over the silent crowd, as if a great weight was pressing on Logen's\nchest, squeezing out his courage. But the task was simple enough, in its way. If the\nFeared's painted side couldn't be harmed, Logen would just have to carve the rest of\nhim, and carve it deep. He'd beaten some hard men in the circle. Ten of the hardest\nbastards in all the North. This was just one more. Or so he tried to tell himself.\n'Where's Bethod?' He'd meant to bellow it, all defiance, but it came out a tame,\ndry squawk.\n'I can watch you die just as well from up here!' The King of the Northmen stood\non the battlements above the open gate, well-groomed and happy, Pale-as-Snow and\na few guards stood about him. If he'd had any trouble sleeping, Logen would never\nhave known it. The morning breeze stirred his hair and the thick fur round his\nshoulders, the morning sun shone on the golden chain, struck sparks from the\ndiamond on his brow. 'Glad you came! I was worried you'd make a run for it!' He\ngave a carefree sigh and it smoked on the sharp air. 'It's morning, like you said. Let's\nget started.'\nLogen looked into the Feared's bulging, twitching, crazy eyes, and swallowed.\n'We're gathered here to witness a challenge!' roared Crummock. 'A challenge to\nput an end to this war, and settle the blood between Bethod, who's taken to calling\nhimself King of the Northmen, and Furious, who speaks for the Union. Bethod wins,\nthe siege is lifted, and the Union leaves the North. Furious wins, then the gates of\nCarleon are opened, and Bethod stands at his mercy. Do I speak true?'\n'You do,' said West, his voice sounding small in all that space.\n'Aye.' Up on his walls, Bethod waved a lazy hand. 'Get to it, fat man.'\n'Then name yourselves, champions!' shouted Crummock, 'and list your"

        "text": "'Aye.' Up on his walls, Bethod waved a lazy hand. 'Get to it, fat man.'\n'Then name yourselves, champions!' shouted Crummock, 'and list your\npedigree!'\nLogen took a step forward. It was a hard step to take, as if he was pushing\nagainst a great wind, but he took it anyway, tilted his head back and looked the\nFeared full in his writhing face. 'I'm the Bloody-Nine, and there's no number on the\nmen I've killed.' The words came out soft and dead. No pride in his empty voice,\nbut no fear either. A cold fact. Cold as the winter. 'Ten challenges I've given, and I\nwon 'em all. In this circle I beat Shama Heartless, Rudd Threetrees, Harding Grim,\nTul Duru Thunderhead, Black Dow, and more besides. If I listed the Named Men\nI've put back in the mud we'd be here at sunrise tomorrow. There's not a man in the\nNorth don't know my work.'\nNothing changed in the giant's face. Nothing more than usual, at least. 'My name\nis Fenris the Feared. My achievements are all in the past.' He held up his painted\nhand, and squeezed the great fingers, and the sinews in his huge blue arm bulged like\nknotted tree roots. 'With these signs great Glustrod marked me out his chosen. With\nthis hand I tore down the statues of Aulcus. Now I kill little men, in little wars.'\nLogen could just make out a tiny shrug of his massive shoulders. 'Such is the way of\nthings.'\nCrummock looked at Logen, and he raised his brows. 'Alright then. What\nweapons have you carried to the fight?'\nLogen lifted the heavy sword, forged by Kanedias for his war against the Magi,\nand held it up to the light. A stride of dull metal, the edge glittered faintly in the pale\nsunrise. 'This blade.' He stabbed it down into the earth between them and left it\nstanding there.\nThe Feared threw his sack rattling down and it sagged open. Inside were great\nblack plates, spiked and studded, scarred and battered. 'This armour.' Logen looked\nat that vast weight of dark iron, and licked his teeth. If the Feared won the spin he\ncould take the sword and leave Logen with a pile of useless armour way too big for\nhim. What would he do then? Hide under it? He only had to hope his luck stuck out\na few minutes longer.\n'Alright, my beauties.' Crummock set his shield down on its rim and took hold of\nthe edge. 'Painted or plain, Ninefingers?'\n'Painted.' Crummock ripped the shield round and set it spinning. Round and\nround, it went—painted, plain, painted, plain. Hope and despair swapped with every\nturn. The wood started to slow, to wobble on its rim. It dropped down flat, plain\nside up, the straps flopping.\nSo much for luck.\nCrummock winced. He looked up at the giant.

It looked\nlike a toy in his monstrous hand. His bulging eyes rolled up to Logen's, and his great\nmouth twisted into a smile. He tossed the sword down at Logen's feet and it\ndropped in the dirt.\n'Take your knife, little man.'\nThe sound of raised voices floated thin on the breeze. 'Alright,' hissed Dow, much\ntoo loud for the Dogman's nerves, 'they're getting started!'\n'I can hear that!' Dogman snapped, coiling the rope round and round into easy\ncircles, ready to throw.\n'You know what you're doing with that? I could do without it dropping on me.'\n'That so?' Dogman swung the grapple back and forward a touch, feeling the\nweight. 'I was just thinking that, after it sticking in that wall, it sticking in your fat\nhead was the second best outcome.' He spun it round in a circle, then a wider one,\nletting some rope slip through his hand, then he hefted it all the way and let it fly. It\nsailed up, real neat, the rope uncoiling after it, and over the battlements. Dogman\nwinced as he heard it clatter on the walkway, but no one came. He pulled on the\nrope. A stride or two slid down, and then it caught. Felt firm as a rock.\n'First time,' said Grim.\nDogman nodded, hardly able to believe it himself. 'What are the odds? Who's\nfirst?'\nDow grinned at him. 'Whoever's got hold o' the rope now, I reckon.'\nAs the Dogman started climbing, he found he was going over all the ways a man\ncould get killed going up this wall. Grapple slipped, and he fell. Rope frayed, and\nsnapped, and he fell. Someone had seen the grapple, was waiting for him to get to\nthe top before they cut the rope. Or they were waiting for him to get to the top\nbefore they cut his throat. Or they were just now calling for a dozen big men to take\nprisoner whatever idiot it was trying to climb into a city on his own.\nHis boots scuffled at the rough stone, the hemp bit at his hands, his arms burned\nat the work, and all the while he did his best to keep his rasping breath quiet. The\nbattlements edged closer, then closer, then he was there. He hooked his fingers onto\nthe stone and peered over. The walkway was empty, both ways. He slipped over the\nparapet, sliding a knife out, just in case. You can never have too many knives, and all\nthat. He checked the grapple was caught firm, then he leaned over, saw Dow at the\nbottom looking up, Grim with the rope in his hands, one foot on the wall, ready to\nclimb. Dogman beckoned to him to say come, watched him start up, hand over\nhand, Dow holding to the bottom of the rope to stop it flapping.

They stared at him, and he\nstared back, seemed like the longest time.\n'There's a rope here!' he shouted, brandishing his knife around and making like he\nwas trying to cut it away from the grapple. 'Some bastard's trying to climb in!'\n'By the dead!' One came running, gawped down at Grim swinging around. 'He's\ncoming up now!'\nThe other one pulled his sword out. 'Don't worry 'bout that.' He lifted it, grinning,\nready to chop through the rope. Then he stopped. 'Here—why you all muddy?'\nDogman stabbed him in the chest, hard as he could, and again. 'Eeeeee!' wailed\nthe Thrall, face screwed up, lurching back against the battlements and dropping his\nsword over the side. His mate came charging up, swinging a big mace. Dogman\nducked under it, but the Thrall barrelled into him and brought him down on his back,\nhead cracking on stone.\nThe mace clattered away and they wrestled around, the Thrall kicking and\npunching while Dogman tried to get his hands round his throat, stop him from calling\nout. They rolled over one way, then back the other, struggled up to standing and\ntottered about down the walkway. The Thrall got his shoulder in Dogman's armpit\nand shoved him back up against the battlements, trying to bundle him over.\n'Shit,' gasped the Dogman as his feet left the ground. He could feel his arse\nscraping the stone, but still he clung on, hands tight round the Thrall's neck,\nstopping him getting a good breath. He went up another inch, felt his head forced\nback, almost more weight on the wrong side of the parapet than the right.\n'Over you go, you fucker!' croaked the Thrall, working his chin away from\nDogman's hands and pushing him a touch further, 'over you—' His eyes went wide.\nHe stumbled back, a shaft sticking out of his side. 'Oh, I don't—' Another thumped\ninto his neck and he lurched a step, would've fallen off the back of the wall if the\nDogman hadn't grabbed his arm and dragged him down onto the walkway, held him\nthere while he slobbered his last breaths.\nWhen he was finished, Dogman rolled up and stood bent over the corpse,\nbreathing. Grim hurried over, taking a good look around to make sure no one else\nwas likely to happen by. 'Alright?'\n'Just once. Just once I'd like to get the help before I'm at the point o' getting\nkilled.'\n'Better'n after.' The Dogman had to admit there was some truth to that. He\nwatched Dow pull himself over the battlements and roll down onto the walkway. The\nThrall Dogman had stabbed was still breathing, just about, sat near the grapple.

'What do you reckon we can do with two dead\nmen?'\nThe Feared seemed to fill the circle, one half bare and blue, the other cased in black\niron, a monster torn free from legends. There was nowhere to hide from his great\nfists, nowhere to hide from the fear of him. Shields rattled and clashed, men roared\nand bellowed, a sea of blurred faces twisted with mad fury.\nLogen crept around the edge of the short grass, trying to keep light on his feet.\nHe might've been smaller, but he was quicker, cleverer. At least he hoped he was. He\nhad to be, or he was mud. Keep moving, rolling, ducking, stay out of the way and\npick his moment. Above all, don't get hit.

Logen\nthrew himself out of the way but it still grazed his cheek and caught his shoulder,\nsent him stumbling. So much for not getting hit. A shield, and not a friendly one,\nshoved him in the back and he lurched the other way, head whipping forward. He\npitched on his face, nearly cut himself on his own sword, rolled desperately to the\nside and saw the Feared's huge boot thud into the ground, soil flying where his skull\nhad been a moment before.\nLogen scrabbled up in time to see the blue hand coming at him again. He ducked\nunderneath it, hacked at the Feared's tattooed flesh as he reeled past. The Maker's\nsword thudded deep into the giant's thigh like a spade into turf. The huge leg\nbuckled and he dropped forward onto his armoured knee. It should have been a\nkilling blow, right through the big veins, but there was hardly more blood than from a\nshaving-scratch.\nStill, if one thing fails you try another. Logen roared as he chopped at the\nFeared's bald head. The blade clanged against the armour on the giant's right arm,\nraised just in time. It scraped down that black steel and slid off, harmless, chopping\ninto the earth and leaving Logen's hands buzzing.\n'Ooof!' The Feared's knee sank into his gut, folded him up and sent him\nstaggering, needing to cough but not having the air to do it. The giant had already\nfound his feet again, armoured hand swinging back, a lump of black iron the size of\na man's head. Logen dived sideways, rolling across the short grass, felt the wind of\nthe great arm ripping past him. It crashed into the shield where he'd been standing,\nbroke it into splintered pieces, flung the man holding it wailing into the earth.\nIt seemed the spirit had been right. The painted side couldn't be hurt. Logen"

Logen\ncrouched, waiting for the clawing pain in his stomach to fade enough for him to\nbreathe, trying to think of some trick to use and coming up with nothing. The Feared\nturned his writhing face towards Logen. Behind him on the ground the felled man\nwhimpered under the wreckage of his shield. The Carls either side of him shuffled in\nto close the gap with some reluctance.\nThe giant took a slow step forwards, and Logen took a painful step back.\n'Still alive,' he whispered to himself. But how long for, it was hard to say.\nWest had never in his life felt so scared, so exhilarated, so very much alive. Not even\nwhen he won the Contest with all the wide Square of Marshals cheering for him. Not\neven when he stormed the walls of Ulrioch, and burst out from the dust and chaos\ninto the warm sunlight. His skin tingled with hope and horror. His hands jerked\nhelplessly with Ninefingers' movements. His lips murmured pointless advice, silent\nencouragement. Beside him Pike and Jalenhorm jostled, shoved, shouted themselves\nhoarse. Behind them the wide crowd roared, straining to see. On the walls they\nleaned out, screaming and shaking their fists in the air. The circle of men flexed with\nthe movements of the fighters, never still, bowing out and sucking in as the\nchampions came forward or fell back.\nAnd almost always, so far, the one falling back was Ninefingers. A great brute of\na man by most standards, he seemed tiny, weak and brittle in that terrifying\ncompany. To make matters a great deal worse, there was something very strange at\nwork here. Something West could only have called magic. Great wounds, deadly\nwounds, closed in the Feared's blue skin before his very eyes. This thing was not a\nman. It could only be a devil, and whenever it towered over him West felt a fear as\nthough he was standing at the very verge of hell.\nWest grimaced as Ninefingers lurched helplessly against the shields on the far\nside of the circle. The Feared raised his armoured fist to deliver a blow that could\nsurely crush a skull to jelly. But it hit nothing but air. Ninefingers jerked away at the\nlast moment and let the iron miss his jaw by a hair. His heavy sword slashed down,\nbounced off the Feared's armoured shoulder with a resounding clang. The giant\nstumbled back and Ninefingers came after him, pale scars stretched on his rigid face.\n'Yes!' hissed West, the men around him bellowing their approval.\nThe next blow shrieked down the giant's armoured side, leaving a long, bright\nscratch and digging up a great sod of earth. The last chopped deep into his painted\nribs and spat out a misty spray of blood, knocked him flailing off balance. West's\nmouth opened wide as the great shadow fell across him. The Feared toppled against\nhis shield like a falling tree and drove him trembling to his knees, wilting under the\ngreat weight, his stomach rolling with horror and disgust."

One of the buckles on the spiked and studded armour, just below\nthe giant's knee, was inches from the fingers of West's free hand. All he could think\nof, in that moment, was that Bethod might escape, after all the dead men he had left,\nscattered up and down the length of Angland. He gritted his teeth and snatched hold\nof the end of the leather strap, thick as a man's belt. He dragged at it as the Feared\nshoved his huge bulk up. The buckle came jingling open, the armour on the mighty\ncalf flapped loose as his foot thumped down again, as his arm lashed out and\nknocked Ninefingers stumbling away.\nWest struggled from the dirt, already greatly regretting his impulsiveness. He\nglanced around the circle, searching for any sign that someone had seen him, but all\neyes were fixed on the fighters. It seemed now a tiny, petulant sort of sabotage that\ncould never make the slightest difference. Beyond getting him killed, of course. It\nwas a fact he had known from childhood. Catch you cheating in a Northern duel,\nand they'll cut the bloody cross in you and pull your guts out.\n'Gah!' Logen jerked away from the armoured fist, tottered to his right as the blue one\nrushed past his face, dived to his left as the iron hand lashed at him again, slid and\nnearly fell. Any one of those blows had been hard enough to take his head off. He\nsaw the painted arm go back, gritted his teeth as he dodged around another of the\nFeared's mighty punches, already swinging the sword up and over.\nThe blade sheared neatly through the blue arm, just below the elbow, sent it\ntumbling away across the circle along with a gout of blood. Logen heaved air into his\nburning lungs and raised the Maker's sword high, setting himself for one last effort.\nThe Feared's eyes rolled up towards the dull grey blade. He jerked his head to one\nside and it chopped deep into his painted skull, showering out specks of dark blood\nand splitting his head down to the eyebrow.\nThe giant's armoured elbow crunched into Logen's ribs, half-lifted him off his\nfeet and flung him kicking across the circle. He bounced from a shield and sprawled\non his face, lay there spitting out dirt while the blurry world spun around him.\nHe winced as he pushed himself up, blinked the tears out of his eyes, and froze.\nThe Feared stepped forward, sword still buried deep in his skull, and picked up his\nsevered arm. He pressed it against the bloodless stump, twisted it to the right, then\nback to the left, and let it go. The great forearm was whole again, the letters ran from\nshoulder to wrist unbroken.\nThe men around the circle fell silent. The giant worked his blue fingers for a\nmoment, then he reached up and closed his hand around the hilt of the Maker's\nsword. He turned it one way, then the other, his skull crunching as bone shifted. He"

He\ndragged the blade free, shook his head as if to clear a touch of dizziness. Then he\ntossed the sword across the circle and it clattered down in front of Logen for the\nsecond time that day.\nLogen stared at it, his chest heaving. It was getting heavier with each exchange.\nThe wounds he'd taken in the mountains ached, the blows he'd taken in the circle\nthrobbed. The air was still cold but his shirt was sticky with sweat.\nThe Feared showed no sign of tiring, even with half a ton of iron strapped to his\nbody. There wasn't so much as a bead of sweat on his twisting face. Not so much\nas a scratch on his tattooed scalp.\nLogen felt the fear pressing hard on him again. He knew now how the mouse felt,\nwhen the cat had him between his paws. He should've run. He should've run and\nnever looked back, but instead he'd chosen this. Say one thing for Logen\nNinefingers, say that bastard never learns. The giant's mouth crawled up into a\nwriggling smile.\n'More,' he said.\nDogman needed to piss as he walked up to the gate of Carleon's inner wall. Always\nneeded to piss at times like this.\nHe had one of the dead Thrall's clothes on, big enough that he'd had to pull the\nbelt too tight, cloak hanging over the bloody knife hole in the shirt. Grim was\nwearing the other's gear, bow over one shoulder, the big mace hanging from his free\nhand. Dow slumped between them, wrists tied at his back, feet scraping stupidly at\nthe cobbles, bloody head hanging like they'd given him quite the beating.\nSeemed a pitiful kind of a ruse, if the Dogman was being honest. There were fifty\nthings he'd counted since they climbed off the walls that could've given them away.\nBut there was no time for anything cleverer. Talk well, and smile, and no one would\nnotice the clues. That's what he hoped anyway.\nA guard stood each side of the wide archway, a pair of Carls in long mail coats\nand helmets, both with spears in their hands.\n'What's this?' one asked, frowning as they walked up close.\n'Found this bastard trying to creep in.' Dogman gave Dow a punch in the side of\nthe head, just to make things look good. 'We're taking him down below, lock him up\n'til after they're done.' He made to walk on past.\nOne of the guards stopped him cold with a hand on his chest, and the Dogman\nswallowed. The Carl nodded towards the city's gates. 'How's it going, down there?'\n'Alright, I guess.' Dogman shrugged. 'It's going, anyway. Bethod'll come out on\ntop, eh? He always does, don't he?'\n'I don't know.' The Carl shook his head.

Dropped him like a chair with\nthe legs kicked away. Same moment almost, Grim's borrowed mace clonked into the\ntop of the other's helmet and left a great dent in it, jammed the rim right down almost\nto the tip of his nose. He dribbled some, stumbling back like he was drunk. Then\nblood came bubbling out of his ears and he fell down on his back.\nDogman turned round, trying to hold his stolen cloak out so no one would see\nDow and Grim dragging the two corpses away, but the town seemed empty.\nEveryone watching the fight, no doubt. He wondered for a moment what was\nhappening, out there in the circle. Long enough to get a nasty feeling in his gut.\n'Come on.' He turned to see Dow grinning all across his bloody face. The two\nbodies he'd just wedged behind the gates, one of 'em staring cross-eyed at the knife\nhole in his head.\n'That good enough?' asked Dogman.\n'What, you want to say a few words for the dead, do you?'\n'You know what I mean, if someone—'\n'No time for clever, now.' Dow grabbed him by the arm and pulled him through\nthe gate. 'Let's kill us a witch.'\nThe sole of the Feared's metal boot thudded into Logen's chest, ripped his breath\nout and rammed him into the earth, the sword tumbling from his clawing hand, puke\nburning at the back of his throat. Before he knew where he was a great shadow fell\nacross him. Metal snapped shut round his wrist, tight as a vice. His legs were kicked\naway and he was on his face, arm twisted behind him and a mouthful of dirt to think\nabout. Something pressed against his cheek. Cold at first, then painful. The Feared's\ngreat foot. His wrist was wrenched round, dragged up. His head was crushed further\ninto the damp ground, short grass prickling up his nose.\nThe tearing pain in his shoulder was awful. Soon it was a lot worse. He was\ncaught fast and helpless, stretched out like a rabbit for skinning. The crowd had\nfallen breathlessly silent, the only sound the battered flesh round Logen's mouth\nsquelching, the air squeaking in one squashed nostril. He would've screamed if his\nface hadn't been so squeezed that he could scarcely wheeze in half a breath. Say one\nthing for Logen Ninefingers, say that he's finished. Back to the mud, and no one\ncould've said he hadn't earned it. A fitting end for the Bloody-Nine, torn apart in the\ncircle.\nBut the great arms didn't pull any further. Out the corner of one flickering eye,\nLogen could just see Bethod leaning against the battlements. The King of the\nNorthmen waved his hand, round and round, in a slow wheel. Logen remembered\nwhat it meant."

The tattooed hand went up,\nblack against the sun, and slapped Logen across the face. Open-handed, as a father\nmight cuff a troublesome child. It was like being hit with a pan. Light burst open in\nLogen's skull, his mouth filled with blood. Things drew into focus just in time for\nhim to see the painted hand swing back the other way. It came down with a terrible\ninevitability and cracked him a backhand blow, as a jealous husband might crack his\nhelpless wife.\n'Gurgh—' he heard himself say, and he was flying. Blue sky, blinding sun, yellow\ngrass, staring faces, all meaningless smears. He crashed into the shields at the edge\nof the circle, flopped half-senseless to the earth. Far away men were shouting,\nscreaming, hissing, but he couldn't hear the words, and hardly cared. All he could\nthink about was the cold feeling in his stomach. As if his guts were stuffed with\nswelling ice.\nHe saw a pale hand, smeared with pink blood, white tendons starting from the\nscratched skin. His hand, of course. There was the stump. But when he tried to\nmake the fingers open they only clutched tighter at the brown earth.\n'Yes,' he whispered, and blood drooled out of his numb mouth and trickled into\nthe grass. The ice spread out from his stomach, out to the very tips of his fingers\nand turned every part of him numb. It was well that it did. It was high time.\n'Yes,' he said. Up, up onto one knee, his bloody lips curling back from his teeth,\nhis bloody right hand snaking through the grass, seeking out the hilt of the Maker's\nsword, closing tight around it.\n'Yes!' he hissed, and Logen laughed, and the Bloody-Nine laughed, together.\nWest had not expected Ninefingers to get up, not ever again, but he did, and when\nhe did, he was laughing. It sounded almost like weeping at first, a slobbering giggle,\nshrill and strange, but it grew louder, sharper, colder as he rose. As if at a cruel joke\nthat no one else could see. A fatal joke. His head fell sideways like a hanged man's,\nlivid face all slack around a hacked-out grin.\nBlood stained his teeth pink, trickled from the cuts on his face, seeped from his\ntorn lips. The laughter gurgled up louder, and louder, ripping at West's ears, jagged\nas a saw-blade. More agonised than any scream, more furious than any war-cry.\nAwfully, sickeningly wrong. Chuckling at a massacre. Slaughterhouse giggling.\nNinefingers lurched forwards like a drunken man, swaying, wild, sword dangling\nfrom his bloody fist.

His mad laughter cut, and grated, and hacked around the circle. West felt\nhimself edging back, mouth dry. All the crowd edged back. They no longer knew\nwho scared them more: Fenris the Feared, or the Bloody-Nine.\nThe world burned.\nHis skin was on fire. His breath was scalding steam. The sword was a brand of\nmolten metal in his fist.\nThe sun stamped white-hot patterns into his prickling eyes, and the cold grey\nshapes of men, and shields, and walls, and of a giant made from blue words and\nblack iron. Fear washed out from him in sickly waves, but the Bloody-Nine only\nsmiled the wider. Fear and pain were fuel on the fire, and the flames surged high, and\nhigher yet.\nThe world burned, and at its centre the Bloody-Nine burned hottest of all. He\nheld out his hand, and he curled the three fingers, and he beckoned.\n'I am waiting,' he said.\nThe great fists lashed at the Bloody-Nine's face, the great hands snatched at his\nbody. But all the giant caught was laughter. Easier to strike the flickering fire. Easier\nto catch the rolling smoke.\nThe circle was an oven. The blades of yellow grass were tongues of yellow flame\nbeneath it. The sweat, spit, blood dripped onto it like gravy from cooking meat.\nThe Bloody-Nine made a hiss, water on coals. The hiss became a growl, iron\nspattering from the forge. The growl became a great roar, the dry forest in flames,\nand he let the sword go free.\nThe grey metal made searing circles, hacked bloodless holes in blue flesh, rang\non black iron. The giant faded away and the blade bit into the face of one of the men\nholding the shields. His head burst apart and sprayed blood across another, a hole\ntorn from the wall around the circle. The others shuffled back, shields wavering, the\ncircle swelling with their fear. They feared him more even than the giant, and they\nwere wise to. Everything that lived was his enemy, and when the Bloody-Nine had\nmade pieces of this devil-thing, he would set to work on them.\nThe circle was a cauldron. On the walls above the crowd surged like angry steam.\nThe ground shifted and swelled under the Bloody-Nine's feet like boiling oil.\nHis roar became a scalding scream, the sword flashed down and clashed from\nspiked armour like a hammer on the anvil. The giant pressed his blue hand to the pale\nside of his head, face squirming like a nest of maggots. The blade had missed his\nskull, but stolen away the top half of his ear. Blood bubbled out from the wound, ran\ndown the side of his great neck in two thin lines, and did not stop.\nThe great eyes went wide and the giant sprang forward with a thundering bellow.\nThe Bloody-Nine rolled under his flailing fist and slid round behind him, saw the\nblack iron on his leg flap away, the bright buckle dangling.

The screaming faces of the men around its edge\ndanced like smoke, swam like molten metal, their shields melting together.\nNow was the time. The morning sun blazed down, glinted bright on the heavy\nchest-plate, marking the spot. Now was the beautiful moment.\nThe world burned, and like a leaping flame the Bloody-Nine reared up, arching\nback, raising high the sword. The work of Kanedias, the Master Maker, no blade\nforged sharper. Its bitter edge scored a long gash in the black armour, through the\niron and into the soft flesh beneath, striking sparks and spattering blood, the shriek\nof tortured metal mingling with the wail of pain torn from the Feared's twisted mouth.\nThe wound it left in him was deep.\nBut not deep enough.\nThe giant's great arms slid round the Bloody-Nine's back, folding him in a\nsmothering embrace. The edges of the black metal pierced his flesh in a dozen\nplaces. Closer the giant drew him, and closer, and a ragged spike slid into the\nBloody-Nine's face, cut through his cheek and scraped against his teeth, bit into the\nside of his tongue and filled his mouth with salt blood.\nThe Feared's grip was the weight of mountains. No matter how hot the\nBloody-Nine's rage, no matter how he squirmed, and thrashed, and screamed in\nfury, he was held as tightly as the cold earth holds the buried dead. The blood\ntrickling from his face, and from his back, and from the great gash in the Feared's\narmour soaked into his clothes and spread out blazing hot over his skin.\nThe World burned. Above the oven, the cauldron, the crucible, Bethod nodded,\nand the giant's cold arms squeezed tighter.\nDogman followed his nose. It rarely led him wrong, his nose, and he hoped to hell\nthat it didn't fail him now. It was a sickly kind of a smell—like sweet cakes left too\nlong in the oven. He led the others along an empty hallway, down a shadowy stair,\ncreeping through the damp darkness in the knotty bowels of Skarling's Hill. He could\nhear something now, as well as smell it, and it sounded as bad as it smelled. A\nwoman's voice, singing soft and low. A strange kind of singing, in no tongue the\nDogman could understand.\n'That must be her,' muttered Dow.\n'Don't like the sound o' that one bit,' Dogman whispered back. 'Sounds like\nmagic'\n'What d'you expect? She's a fucking witch ain't she? I'll go round behind.'\n'No, wait on—' But Dow was already creeping off the other way, boots padding\nsoft and silent.\n'Shit.' Dogman followed the smell, creeping down the passageway with Grim at\nhis back, the chanting coming louder and louder. A streak of light slunk out from an\narchway and he eased towards it, pressed his side to the wall and took a peer round\nthe corner."

A streak of light slunk out from an\narchway and he eased towards it, pressed his side to the wall and took a peer round\nthe corner.\nThe room on the other side had about as witchy a look as a room could ever\nhave. Dark and windowless, three other black doorways round the walls. It was lit\njust by one smoky brazier up at the far end, sizzling coals shedding a dirty red light\non it all, giving off a sick sweet stink. There were jars and pots scattered all round,\nbundles of twigs, and grass, and dried-out flowers hanging from the greasy rafters,\ncasting strange shadows into the corners, like the shapes of hanged men swinging.\nThere was a woman standing over the brazier with her back to the Dogman. Her\nlong, white arms were spread out wide, shining with sweat. Gold glinted round her\nthin wrists, black hair straggled down her back. The Dogman might not have known\nthe words she was singing but he could guess it was some dark work she was up to.\nGrim held up his bow, one eyebrow raised. Dogman shook his head, silently\ndrew his knife. Tricky to kill her right off with a shaft, and who knew what she might\ndo once she was shot? Cold steel in the neck left nothing to chance.\nTogether they crept into the room. The air was hot in there, thick as swamp\nwater. Dogman sneaked forward, trying not to breathe, sure the reek would throttle\nhim if he did. He sweated, or the room did, leastways his skin was beaded up with\ndew in no time. He picked his steps, finding a path between all the rubbish strewn\nacross the floor—boxes, bundles, bottles. He worked his damp palm round the grip\nof his knife, fixed his eyes on the point between her shoulders, the point he'd stab it\ninto—\nHis foot caught a jar and sent it clattering. The woman's head jerked round, the\nchant stopped dead on her lips. A gaunt, white face, pale as a drowned man's, black\npaint round her narrow eyes—blue eyes, cold as the ocean.\nThe circle was silent. The men around its edge were still, their faces and their shields\nhanging limp. The crowd at their backs, the people pressed to the parapet above, all\nheld motionless, all quiet as the dead.\nFor all of Ninefingers' mad rage, for all his twisting and his struggling, the giant\nhad him fast. Thick muscles squirmed under blue skin as the Feared's great arms\ntightened and slowly crushed the life from him. West's mouth was bitter with\nhelpless disappointment. All that he had done, all that he had suffered, all those lives\nlost, for nothing. Bethod would go free.\nThen Ninefingers gave an animal growl. The Feared held him still, but his blue\narm. was trembling with the effort. As if he was suddenly weakened, and could\nsqueeze no further. Every sinew of West's own body was rigid as he watched. The\nthick strap of the shield bit into his palm. His jaw was clenched so tight that his teeth\nached. The two fighters were locked together, straining against each other with every\nfibre and yet entirely still, frozen in the centre of the circle."

He'd never heard a voice like it. One word and there\nwas no thought in his head. He stared at the pale woman, his mouth open, his breath\nhardly moving, wishing that she'd say another.\n'You too,' she said, glancing over at Grim, and his face went slack, and he\ngrinned, halfway through drawing his bow.\nShe looked Dogman up and down, then pouted as if she was all disappointment.\n'Is that any way for guests to behave?'\nDogman blinked. What the hell had he been thinking barging in here with a drawn\nblade? He couldn't believe he'd done such a thing. He blushed to the roots of his\nhair. 'Oh… I'm sorry… by the dead…'\n'Gugh!' said Grim, throwing his bow into the corner of the room as if he'd\nsuddenly realised he had a turd in his hand, then staring down at the arrow, baffled.\n'That's better.' She smiled, and the Dogman found he was grinning like an idiot.\nSome spit might've come out of his mouth maybe, just a bit, but he weren't that\nbothered. As long as she kept talking nothing else seemed o' too much importance.\nShe beckoned to them, long white fingers stroking at the thick air. 'No need to stand\nso far away from me. Come closer.'\nHim and Grim stumbled towards her like eager children, Dogman near tripping\nover his feet in his hurry to please, Grim barging into a table on the way and coming\nclose to falling on his face.\n'My name is Caurib.'\n'Oh,' said Dogman. Most beautiful name ever, no doubt about it. Amazing, that a\nsingle word could be so beautiful.\n'Harding Grim's my name!'\n'Dogman, they call me, 'count of a sharp sense o' smell, and… er…' By the dead,\nbut it was hard to think straight. There'd been something important he was meant to\nbe doing, but for the life of him he couldn't think what.\n'Dogman… perfect.' Her voice was soothing as a warm bath, as a soft kiss, as\nmilk and honey… 'Don't sleep yet!' Dogman's head rolled, Caurib's painted face a\nblack and white blur, swimming in front of him.\n'Sorry!' he gurgled, blushing again and trying to hide the knife behind his back.\n'Right sorry about the blade… no idea what—'\n'Don't worry. I am glad that you brought it. I think it would be best if you used it\nto stab your friend.'\n'Him?' Dogman squinted at Grim.\nGrim grinned and nodded back at him. 'Aye, definitely!'\n'Right, right, good idea.' Dogman lifted up the knife, seeming to weigh a ton.\n'Er… anywhere you'd like him stabbed, in particular?'\n'In the heart will do nicely.'\n'Right you are. Right. The heart it is.'

'That bitch talks too\nmuch,' he grunted.\nThe Bloody-Nine felt the change. Like the first green shoot of spring. Like the first\nwarmth on the wind as the summer comes. There was a message in the way the\nFeared held him. His bones were no longer groaning, threatening to burst apart. The\ngiant's strength was less, and his was more.\nThe Bloody-Nine sucked in the air and his rage burned hot as ever. Slowly,\nslowly, he dragged his face away from the giant's shoulder, felt the metal slide out\nfrom his mouth. He twisted, twisted until his neck was free. Until he was staring into\nthe giant's writhing face. The Bloody-Nine smiled, then he darted forward, fast as a\nshower of sparks, and sank his teeth deep into that big lower lip.\nThe giant grunted, shifted his arms, tried to drag the Bloody-Nine's head away,\ntear the biting teeth out of his mouth. But he could more easily have shaken off the\nplague. His arms loosened and the Bloody-Nine twisted the hand that held the\nMaker's sword. He twisted it, as the snake twists in its nest, and slowly he began to\nwork it free.\nThe giant's blue left arm uncoiled from the Bloody-Nine's body, his blue hand\nseized hold of the Bloody-Nine's wrist, but there could be no stopping it. When the\nsapling seed finds a crack in the mountain, over long years its deep roots will burst\nthe very rock apart. So the Bloody-Nine strained with every muscle and let the slow\ntime pass, hissing out his hatred into the Feared's twitching mouth. The blade crept\nonwards, slowly, slowly, and its very point bit into painted flesh, just below the\ngiant's bottom rib.\nThe Bloody-Nine felt the hot blood trickling down the grip and over his bunched\nfist, trickling out of the Feared's mouth and into his, running down his neck, leaking\nfrom the wounds across his back, dripping to the ground, just as it should be.\nSoftly, gently, the blade slid into the Feared's tattooed body, sideways, upwards,\nonwards.\nThe great hands clawed at the Bloody-Nine's arm, at his back, seeking"

The movement of his\nhands was the growing of a mighty tree, one hair's breadth at a time, but no flesh, no\nstone, no metal could stop it.\nThe giant's painted side could not be harmed. Great Glustrod had made it so,\nlong years ago, in the Old Time, when the words were written upon the Feared's\nskin. But Glustrod wrote on one half only. Slowly, now, softly, gently, the point of\nthe Maker's sword crossed the divide and into the unmarked half of him, dug into his\ninnards, spitted him like meat made ready for the fire.\nThe giant made a great, high shriek, and the last strength melted from his hands.\nThe Bloody-Nine opened his jaws and let him free, one arm holding tight to his back\nwhile the other drove the sword on into him. The Bloody-Nine hissed laughter\nthrough his clenched teeth, dribbled laughter through the ragged hole in his face. He\nrammed the blade as far as it would go, and its point slid out between the plates of\narmour just beneath the giant's armpit and glinted red in the sun.\nFenris the Feared tottered backwards, still making his long squeal, his mouth\nhanging open and a string of red spit dangling from his lip, the painted half already\nhealed over, the pale half tattered as mince-meat. The circle of men watched him,\nfrozen, gaping over the tops of their shields. His feet shuffled in the dirt, one hand\nfumbling for the red hilt of the Maker's sword, buried to the cross-piece in his side,\nblood dripping from the pommel and leaving red spots scattered across the ground.\nHis squeal became a rattling groan, one foot tripped the other and he toppled like a\nfelled tree and crashed over on his back, in the centre of the circle, great arms and\nlegs spread wide. The twitching of his face was finally still, and there was a long\nsilence.\n'By the dead.' It was spoken softly, thoughtfully. Logen squinted into the morning\nsun, saw the black shape of a man looking down at him from the high gatehouse. 'By\nthe dead, I never thought you'd do it.' The world tipped from side to side as Logen\nbegan to walk, the breath hissing cold through the wound in his face, scraping in his\nraw throat.\nThe men who'd made the circle moved out of his way, now, their voices fallen\nsilent, their shields hanging from their hands.\n'Never thought you could do it, but when it comes to killing, there's no man\nbetter!

You'll never make anything\nbut corpses!'\nOut onto the roof, blinking in the morning brightness, spitting a mouthful of\nblood over his shoulder. Bethod stood at the battlements. The Named Men stumbled\nout of Logen's way as he strode towards him.\n'You're made of death, Bloody-Nine! You're made of—'\nLogen's fist crunched into his jaw and he took a flopping step back. Logen's\nother hand smashed into his cheek and he reeled against the parapet, a long string of\nbloody drool running from his split mouth. Logen caught the back of his head and\njerked his knee up into Bethod's face, felt his nose crunch flat against it. Logen\ntangled his fingers in Bethod's hair, gripped it tight, pulled his head up high, and\nrammed it down into the stones.\n'Die!' he hissed.\nBethod jerked, gurgled, Logen lifted his head and drove it down again, and again.\nThe golden ring flew off his broken skull, bounced across the rooftop with a merry\njingling.\n'Die!'\nBone crunched, and blood shot out over the stone in fat drops and thin spatters.\nPale-as-Snow and his Named Men stared, white-faced, helpless and fearful, horrified\nand delighted.\n'Die, you fucker!'\nAnd Logen hauled Bethod's ruined corpse into the air with one last effort and\nflung it tumbling over the battlements.

He watched it crunch to the\nground and lie, on its side, arms and legs stuck out awkwardly, fingers curled as if\nthey were grasping at something, the head no more than a dark smear on the hard\nearth.

They were all too drunk with blood\nand fury, or busy thinking what was easiest, or too scared to say any different. The\nchants broke out all over, first a trickle of them, then a flow, and then a flood, and all\nLogen could do was watch, clinging to the bloody stone and trying not to fall.\n'The Bloody-Nine! King o' the Northmen!'\nPale-as-Snow was down on one knee beside him, spots of Bethod's blood\nsprayed across the white fur on his coat. He always had been one to lick whatever\narse was nearest, but he wasn't alone. They were all kneeling, up on the walls and\ndown on the grass. The Dogman's Carls and Bethod's. The men who'd held the\nshields for Logen and the ones who'd held the shields for the Feared. Maybe Bethod\nhad taught them a lesson. Maybe they'd forgotten how to be their own men, and now\nthey needed someone else to tell them what to do.\n'No,' whispered Logen, but all that came out was a dull slurp. He had no more\npower to stop it than he had to make the sky fall in. Seemed to him then that men do\npay for the things they've done, alright. But sometimes the payment isn't what they\nexpected.\n'The Bloody-Nine!' roared Crummock again, as he sank down on his knees and\nlifted up his arms towards the sky, 'King o' the Northmen!'\nGreater Good\n« ^ »\nThe room was another over-bright box. It had the same off-white walls, spotted with\nbrown stains. Mould, or blood, or both. The same battered table and chairs.\nVirtually instruments of torture in themselves. The same burning pains in Glokta's\nfoot, and leg, and back. Some things never change. The same prisoner, as far as\nanyone could have told, with the same canvas bag over their head. Just like the\ndozens who have been through this room over the past few days, and just like the\ndozens more crammed into the cells beyond the door, waiting on our pleasure.\n'Very well.' Glokta waved a tired hand, 'let us begin.'\nFrost dragged the bag from the prisoner's head. A long, lean Kantic face with\ndeep creases around the mouth and a neatly trimmed black beard, streaked with\ngrey. A wise, dignified face, deep-set eyes even now adjusting to the glare.\nGlokta burst out laughing. Each chuckle stabbed at the base of his stiff spine and\nrattled his stiff neck, but he could not help himself. Even after all these years, fate\ncan still play jokes on me.\n'Wath futhy?' grunted Frost.\nGlokta wiped his runny eye. 'Practical Frost, we are truly honoured. Our latest\nprisoner is none other than Master Farrad, formerly of Yashtavit in Kanta, and more\nrecently of a magnificent address at the top of the Kingsway. We are in the presence\nof the finest dentist in the Circle of the World.' And one must appreciate the irony."

And one must appreciate the irony.\nFarrad blinked into the glaring lamplight. 'I know you.'\n'Yes.'\n'You are the one who was a prisoner of the Gurkish.'\n'Yes.'\n'The one they tortured. I remember… you were brought to me.'\n'Yes.'\nFarrad swallowed. As though the memory alone is enough to make him vomit.\nHe glanced up at Frost and the pink eyes glowered back, unblinking. He glanced\nround the grubby, bloodstained room, at the cracked tiles, at the scarred table-top.\nHis eyes lingered on the paper of confession lying upon it. 'After what they did to\nyou—how can you do this, now?'\nGlokta showed Farrad his toothless grin. 'After what they did to me, how could I\ndo anything else?'\n'Why am I here?'\n'For the same reason as everyone else who comes here.' Glokta watched Frost\nplant the heavy tips of his fingers on the paper of confession and slide it deliberately\nacross the table towards the prisoner. 'To confess.'\n'Confess to what?'\n'Why, to spying for the Gurkish.'\nFarrad's face creased up with disbelief. 'I am no spy! The Gurkish took\neverything from me! I fled my home when they came! I am innocent, you must know\nthis!'\nOf course. As have been all the spies who confessed in this room over the last\nfew days. But they all confessed, without exception. 'Will you sign the paper?'\n'I have nothing to confess to!'\n'Why is it that no one can answer the questions I ask?' Glokta stretched out his\naching back, worked his creaking neck from side to side, rubbed at the bridge of his\nnose with finger and thumb. Nothing helped. But then nothing ever does. Why must\nthey always make it so very difficult, for me and for themselves? 'Practical Frost,\nwould you show the good master our work so far?'\nThe albino slid a dented tin bucket out from under the table and dumped the\ncontents without ceremony in front of the prisoner. Teeth clattered, and slid, and\nspun across the wood. Hundreds of them. Teeth of all shapes and sizes, from white,\nthrough all the shades of yellow, to brown. Teeth with bloody roots and with shreds\nof flesh attached. A couple tumbled from the far end of the table and bounced from\nthe grimy tiles, clicked away into the corners of the narrow room.\nFarrad gaped down in horror at the bloody mess of dentistry before him. And\neven the very Prince of Teeth can never have seen such a thing. Glokta leaned\nforwards. 'I daresay you've pulled a tooth or two before yourself.' The prisoner\nnodded dumbly. 'Then you can probably imagine how tired I am after this lot. That's\nwhy I'd really like to be done with you as quickly as possible. I don't want you here,\nand you certainly don't want to be here. We can help each other.'\n'What must I do?' muttered Farrad, his tongue moving nervously around his own\nmouth.\n'It is not complicated. First you sign your confession.'"

You have been named already,\nseveral times.'\nThe dentist swallowed, then shook his head, and pushed the paper away. A brave\nman, and a righteous one. But bravery and righteousness are bad virtues to have\nin this room. 'I will sign. But I will not name innocent men. God have mercy on me, I\nwill not.'\n'God might have mercy on you. But he doesn't hold the pliers down here. Clamp\nhim.'\nFrost gripped Farrad's head from behind with one great white hand, tendons\nstanding from the pale skin as he forced his mouth open. Then he shoved the clamp\nbetween Farrad's jaws and spun the nut round nimbly between finger and thumb until\nthey were held wide open.\n'Ah!' gurgled the dentist. 'Ayrh!'\n'I know. And we're just getting started.' Glokta pushed back the lid of his case,\nwatched the polished wood, the sharpened steel, the shining glass spread outwards.\nWhat the… There was a disconcerting gap in the tools. 'For pity's sake! Have you\nhad the pliers out of here, Frost?'\n'Nuh,' grunted the albino, shaking his head angrily.\n'Damn it! Can none of these bastards keep their own instruments? Go next door\nand see if we can borrow some, at least.'\nThe Practical lumbered from the room, the heavy door hanging ajar behind him.\nGlokta winced as he rubbed at his leg. Farrad stared at him, spit running from one\ncorner of his forced-open mouth. His bulging eyes rolled sideways as a howl of pain\ncame muffled from the corridor outside.\n'I do apologise for this,' said Glokta. 'We're usually a great deal more organised,\nbut it's been busy as hell here the last few days. Such a lot to get through, you see.'\nFrost pulled the door shut and handed Glokta a pair of rusty pliers, handles first.\nThere was some dry blood and a couple of curly hairs caked to the jaws.\n'Is this the best they could do? These are dirty!'\nFrost shrugged. 'Whath a ifferenth?'\nA fair point, I suppose. Glokta gave a long sigh, struggled up from his chair and\nleaned forwards to peer into Farrad's mouth. And a sweet set he has, too. A pearly\nwhite complement. I suppose you'd expect prize-winning teeth from a\nprize-winning dentist. Anything else would be a poor advertisement for his trade.\n'I applaud your cleanliness. It's a rare privilege to question a man who appreciates\nthe importance of washing the mouth out. I can't say I've ever seen a better set of\nteeth.' Glokta tapped at them happily with the pliers. 'It seems a shame to tear them"

'It seems a shame to tear them\nall out, just so that you can confess in ten minutes time instead of now, but there we\nare.' He closed the jaws around the nearest tooth, worked his hand around the\nhandles.\n'Gurlgh,' gurgled Farrad. 'Glaigh!'\nGlokta pursed his lips, as though considering, then released the pliers. 'Let us\ngive the good master one further chance to talk.' Frost unscrewed the clamp and\npulled it from Farrad's mouth along with a string of drool.

He scowled as he turned his head,\npreparing to scream at his presumptuous visitor.\n'Your Eminence,' he whispered, with barely concealed dismay, grimacing as he\nstruggled to get up from his chair.\n'No need to rise, I do not have all day.' Glokta found himself frozen in the most\npainful possible position, bent somewhere between sitting and standing, and had to\nsag back into his chair with little grace as Sult swept into the room, three of his huge\nPracticals looming silently in the doorway behind him. 'You may ask your freak of\nnature to leave us.'\nFrost's eyes narrowed, flickered over the other Practicals, then back to Sult.\n'Very good, Practical Frost,' said Glokta hastily. 'You may remove our prisoner.'\nThe albino unlocked Farrad's manacles and dragged the dentist from his chair\nwith one white fist, hauled him gasping by his collar to the door at the back of the\nroom and ripped back the bolt with his free hand. He gave one pink glare over his\nshoulder and Sult glared back. Then he slammed the door behind him.\nHis Eminence slid into the chair opposite Glokta. No doubt still warm from the\nsweating arse of the brave and righteous Master Farrad. He brushed some of the\nteeth from the table-top before him with the side of one gloved hand and sent them\nclicking onto the floor. And he could not have seemed to care less had they been\nbreadcrumbs. 'There is a deadly conspiracy afoot within the Agriont. Have we made\nprogress in unmasking it?'\n'I have interviewed most of the Kantic prisoners, extracted a suitable number of\nconfessions, there should not be—'\nSult gave an angry wave of his hand.

'I find\nmyself in a difficult situation.'\n'I have some experience with those.'\n'This one is… complicated.'\n'Well then, in terms a dull wench like me might understand.'\nWhere's the harm? I stare death in the face already. 'In the terms of a dull\nwench, then, imagine this… desperately needing certain favours, you have promised\nyour hand in marriage to two very rich and powerful men.'\n'Huh. One would be a fine thing.'\n'None would be a fine thing, in this particular case. They are both old and of\nsurpassing ugliness.'\nShe shrugged. 'Ugliness is easily forgiven in the rich and powerful.'\n'But both these suitors are prone to violent displays of jealousy. Dangerous\ndisplays, if your wanton faithlessness were to become common knowledge. You had\nhoped to extricate yourself from one promise or the other at some stage, but now\nthe date of the weddings draws near, and you find that you are… still considerably\nentangled with both. More so than ever, in fact. Your response?'\nShe pursed her lips and took a long breath, considering it, then tossed a strand of\nhair theatrically over her shoulder. 'I would drive them both near madness with my\nmatchless wit and smouldering beauty, then engineer a duel between the two.\nWhichever won would be rewarded with the ultimate prize of my hand in marriage,\nnever suspecting I was once promised also to his rival. Since he is old, I would\nearnestly hope for his imminent death, leaving me a wealthy and respected widow.'\nShe grinned at him down her nose. 'What say you to that, sir?'\nGlokta blinked. 'I fear the metaphor has lost its relevance.'\n'Or…' Ardee squinted at the ceiling, then snapped her fingers. 'I might use my\nsubtle feminine wiles…' thrusting back her shoulders and hitching up her bust, 'to\nentrap a third man, still more powerful and wealthy. Young, and handsome, and\nsmooth of limb as well, I suppose, since this is a metaphor. I would marry him and\nwith his help destroy those other two, and abandon them penniless and\ndisappointed. Ha! What think you?'"

'The idea had never even occurred.'\nSkarlings Chair\n« ^ »\nFar below, the water frothed and surged. It had rained hard in the night, and now the\nriver ran high with it, an angry flood chewing mindlessly at the base of the cliff. Cold\nblack water and cold white spray against the cold black rock. Tiny shapes—golden\nyellow, burning orange, vivid purple, all the colours of fire, whisked and wandered\nwith the mad currents, whatever way the rain washed them.\nLeaves on the water, just like him.\nAnd now it looked as if the rain would wash him south. To fight some more. To\nkill men who'd never heard of him. The idea of it made him want to be sick. But he'd\ngiven his word, and a man who doesn't keep his word isn't much of a man at all.\nThat's what Logen's father used to tell him.\nHe'd spent a lot of long years not keeping to much of anything. His word, and the\nwords of his father, and other men's lives, all meaning less than nothing. All the\npromises he'd made to his wife and to his children he'd let rot. He'd broken his word\nto his people, and his friends, and himself, more times than he could count. The\nBloody-Nine. The most feared man in the North. A man who'd walked all his days in\na circle of blood. A man who'd done nothing in all his life but evil. And all the while\nhe'd looked at the sky and shrugged his shoulders. Blamed whoever was nearest,\nand told himself he'd had no choices.\nBethod was gone. Logen had vengeance, at last, but the world wasn't suddenly a\nbetter place. The world was the same, and so was he. He spread out the fingers of\nhis left hand on the damp stone, bent and wonky from a dozen old breaks, knuckles\nscratched and scabbing, nails cracked and wedged under with dirt. He stared down\nat the familiar stump for a moment.\n'Still alive,' he whispered, hardly able to believe it.\nHe winced at the pain in his battered ribs, groaned as he turned away from the\nwindow and back into the great hall. Bethod's throne room, and now his. The\nthought tugged a meagre belch of laughter out of his gut, but even that stabbed at the\nmass of stitches through his cheek and up the side of his face. He limped out across\nthe wide floor, every step an ordeal. The sound of his scraping boots echoed in the\nhigh rafters, over the whispering of the river down below. Shafts of blurred light,\nheavy with floating dust, shone down and made criss-cross patterns across the\nboards. Near to Logen, on a raised-up dais, stood Skarling's Chair.\nThe hall, and the city, and the land around it had all changed far beyond\nrecognition, but Logen reckoned the chair itself was much the same as it had been"

Skarling Hoodless, greatest hero of the North. The man who'd\nunited the clans to fight against the Union, long ago. The man who'd drawn the\nNorth together with words and gestures, for a few brief years, at least.\nA simple seat for a simple man—big, honest chunks of old wood, faded paint\naround the edges, polished smooth by Skarling's sons, and grandsons, and the men\nwho'd led his clan since. Until the Bloody-Nine came knocking at the gates of\nCarleon. Until Bethod took the chair for his own, and pretended that he was all that\nSkarling had been, while he forced the North together with fire, and fear, and steel.\n'Well then?' Logen jerked his head round, saw Black Dow leaning in the doorway,\narms folded across his chest. 'Ain't you going to sit in it?'\nLogen shook his head, even though his legs were aching so bad he could hardly\nbear to stand a moment longer. 'Mud always did for me to sit on. I'm no hero, and\nSkarling was no king.'\n'Turned down a crown, as I heard it told.'\n'Crowns.' Logen spat onto the straw, spit still pink from the cuts in his mouth.\n'Kings. The whole notion's shit, and me the worst choice there could be.'\n'You ain't saying no, though, eh?'\nLogen frowned up at him. 'So some other bastard even worse'n Bethod can sit in\nthat chair, make the North bleed some more? Maybe I can do some good with it.'\n'Maybe.' Dow looked straight back. 'But some men aren't made for doing good.'\n'You talking 'bout me again?' chuckled Crummock, striding in through the\ndoorway, Dogman and Grim at his shoulder.\n'Not all talk's about you, Crummock,' said Dogman. 'You sleep alright, Logen?'\n'Aye,' he lied. 'Like the dead.'\n'What now?'\nLogen stared at that chair. 'South, I reckon.'\n'South,' grunted Grim, giving no clue whether he thought it was a good idea or a\nbad.\nLogen licked at the ragged flesh at the side of his mouth, checking again, for no\nreason that made any sense, just how much it hurt. 'Calder and Scale are still out\nthere, somewhere. No doubt Bethod sent 'em to find some help. From out past the\nCrinna, or up in the high valleys, or wherever.'\nCrummock chuckled softly. 'Ah, the good work's never done.'\n'They'll be causing mischief sooner or later,' said Dogman, 'small doubt o' that.'\n'Someone needs to stay back here and keep a watch on things. Hunt those two\nbastards out if they can.'\n'I'll do it,' said Black Dow.\n'You sure?'\nDow shrugged. 'I don't like boats and I don't like the Union. Don't need to take\nno voyage to work that out.

And I've got scores enough to settle with Calder and\nScale. I'll pick me some Carls out o' what's left, and I'll pay 'em a visit.' He flashed\nhis nasty grin, and clapped Dogman on the arm. 'Good luck to the rest o' you down\nthere with the Southerners, eh? Try not to get yourselves killed.' He narrowed his\neyes at Logen. 'You especially, eh, Bloody-Nine? Wouldn't want to lose us another\nKing o' the Northmen, now, would we?' And he sauntered out, arms folded.\n'How many men we got left over?'\n'Might be three hundred, now, if Dow takes a few.'\nLogen gave a long sigh. 'Best get 'em ready to leave then. Wouldn't want Furious\nto go without us.'\n'Who'll want to go?' asked Dogman. 'After what they been through these past\nmonths? Who'll want more killing now?'\n'Men who don't know how to do much else, I guess.' Logen shrugged. 'Bethod\nhad gold down there, didn't he?'\n'Aye, some.'\n'Then share it out. Plenty for each man comes with us. Some now, some when\nwe get back. Reckon a good few'll take the offer.'\n'Maybe. Men'll talk hard for gold. Not sure they'll fight hard for it, when the time\ncomes.'\n'I reckon we'll see.'\nDogman stared at him for a long moment. Stared him right in the eye. 'Why?'\n'Because I gave my word.'\n'And? Never bothered you before, did it?'\n'Can't say it did, and there's the problem.' Logen swallowed, and his mouth\ntasted bad. 'What else can you do, but try and do better?'\nDogman nodded, slow, his eyes not leaving Logen's face. 'Right you are then,\nchief. South it is.'\n'Uh,' said Grim, and the two of them walked out the doorway, leaving just\nCrummock behind.\n'Off to the Union for you is it, your Majesty? South and kill you some brown men\nin the sun?'\n'South.' Logen worked one sore shoulder beside his sore neck, and then the\nother. 'You coming?'\nCrummock pushed himself away from the wall and walked forward, finger bones\nclicking round his thick neck. 'No, no, no, not me. I've relished our time together, so\nI have, but everything's got an end, don't it. I've been away from my mountains for\nfar too long, and my wives'll be missing me.' The chief of the hillmen held his arms\nout wide, took a step forward, and hugged Logen tight. A little too tight for comfort,\nif he was being honest.\n'They can have a king if they want one,' whispered Crummock in his ear, 'but I\ncan't say I do.

That I\nwouldn't know?' The hillman leaned back to look Logen in the eye. 'You slaughtered\nhim before the whole world, now, didn't you? You butchered little Rond like a sheep\nfor the pot, and him just as helpless as one.'\nThey were alone in that wide hall, just the two of them, and the shadows, and\nSkarling's chair. Logen winced as Crummock's arms squeezed tighter, round the\nbruises and the wounds the Feared's arms had left him. Logen hadn't the strength left\nnow to fight a cat, and they both knew it. The hillman could've crushed him flat, and\nfinished the job the Feared had started. But he only smiled.\n'Don't you worry, now, Bloody-Nine. I've got what I wanted, haven't I? Bethod's\ndead and gone, and his Feared, and his witch, and his whole bastard notion of clans\nunited, all back to the mud where they belong. With you in charge, I daresay it'll be a\nhundred years before folk in the North stop killing each other. Meantime maybe we\nup in the hills can have some peace, eh?'\n'Course you can,' croaked Logen, through his gritted teeth, grimacing as\nCrummock pressed him even tighter.\n'You killed my son, that's true, but I've got plenty more. You have to weed the\nweak ones out, don't you know? The weak and the unlucky. You don't put a wolf\namongst your sheep then cry when you find one eaten, do you?'\nLogen could only stare. 'You really are mad.'\n'Maybe I am, but there's worse than me out there.' He leaned close again, soft\nbreath in Logen's ear. 'I'm not the one killed the boy, am I?' He let Logen free, and\nhe slapped him on the shoulder. The way a friend might, but there was no friendship\nin it. 'Don't ever come up in the High Places again, Ninefingers, that's my advice. I\nmight not be able to give you another friendly reception.' He turned and walked\naway, slowly, waving one fat finger over his shoulder. 'Don't come up in the High\nPlaces again, Bloody-Nine! You're beloved o' the moon just a little too much for my\ntaste!'\nLeadership\n« ^ »\nJezal clattered through the cobbled streets astride a magnificent grey, Bayaz and\nMarshal Varuz just behind him, a score of Knights of the Body, led by Bremer dan\nGorst, following in full war gear. It was strangely unsettling to see the city, usually so\nbrimful with humanity, close to deserted. Only a scattering of threadbare urchins, of\nnervous city watchmen, of suspicious commoners remained to hurry out of the way\nof the royal party as they passed. Most of those citizens who had stayed in Adua\nwere well barricaded in their bedrooms, Jezal imagined. He would have been tempted\nto do the same, had Queen Terez not beaten him to it."

Bayaz was demanding over the clatter of hooves.\n'The vanguard appeared before dawn,' Jezal heard Varuz shout back. 'And more\nGurkish troops have been pouring in down the Keln road all morning. There were a\nfew skirmishes in the districts beyond Casamir's Wall, but nothing to slow them\nsignificantly. They are already halfway to encircling the city.'\nJezal jerked his head round. 'Already?'\n'The Gurkish always liked to come prepared, your Majesty.' The old soldier\nurged his horse up beside him. 'They have started to construct a palisade around\nAdua, and have brought three great catapults with them. The same ones that proved\nso effective in their siege of Dagoska. By noon we will be entirely surrounded.' Jezal\nswallowed. There was something about the word 'surrounded' that caused an\nuncomfortable tightening in his throat.\nThe column slowed to a stately walk as they approached the city's westernmost\ngate. It was, in an irony that gave Jezal little pleasure, the very same gate through\nwhich he had entered the city in triumph before he was crowned High King of the\nUnion. A crowd had gathered in the shadow of Casamir's Wall, larger even than the\none that had greeted him after his strange victory over the peasants. Today,\nhowever, there was hardly a mood of celebration. Smiling girls had been replaced by\nfrowning men, fresh flowers with old weapons. Polearms stuck up above the press\nat all angles in an unruly forest, points and edges glinting. Pikes and pitch forks, bill\nhooks and boat hooks, brooms with the twigs removed and knives nailed in their\nplaces.\nThere was a smattering of King's Own padded out by some squinting members\nof the city watch, a few puffed-up tradesmen with leather jerkins and polished\nswords, some slouching labourers with antique flatbows and tough expressions.\nThese were the very best of what was on offer. They were accompanied by a\nrandom assortment of citizens of both sexes and all ages, equipped with a\nbewildering range of mismatched armour and weapons. Or nothing at all. It was\ndifficult to tell who was supposed to be a soldier and who a citizen, if, indeed, there\nwas still a difference. Every one of them was looking at Jezal as he smartly\ndismounted, his golden spurs jingling. Looking to him, he realised, as he began to\nwalk out among them, his well-armoured bodyguard clanking behind.\n'These are the defenders of this borough?' murmured Jezal to Lord Marshal\nVaruz, following at his shoulder.\n'Some of them, your Majesty. Accompanied by some enthusiastic townsfolk. A\ntouching spectacle.'\nJezal would happily have traded a touching crowd for an effective one, but he\nsupposed a leader had always to appear indomitable before his followers. Bayaz had\ntold him so often. How doubly, how triply true of a king before his subjects?\nEspecially a king whose grip on his recently won crown might be thought of as\nslippery at best."

He strode through the crowd with the\nconfident swagger he had always used to have, one hand resting on the jewelled\npommel of his sword, hoping with every step that no one caught an inkling of the\ncauldron of fear and doubt behind his eyes. The crowd muttered as he swept past,\nVaruz and Bayaz hurrying behind. Some made attempts at bows, others did not\nbother.\n'The king!'\n'I thought he'd be taller…'\n'Jezal the Bastard.' Jezal snapped his head round, but there was no way of telling\nwho spoke.\n'That's Luthar!'\n'A cheer for 'is Majesty!' Followed by a half-hearted murmur.\n'This way,' said a pale-looking officer before the gate, indicating a staircase with\none apologetic hand. Jezal climbed manfully, two stone steps at a time, spurs\njingling. He came out onto the roof of the gatehouse and froze, his lip curling with\ndistaste. Who should be standing there but his old friend Superior Glokta, bent over\non his cane, his repulsive toothless smile on his face?\n'Your Majesty,' he leered, voice heavy with irony. 'What an almost overwhelming\nhonour.' He lifted his cane to point towards the far parapet. 'The Gurkish are that\nway.'\nJezal was attempting to frame a suitably acidic reply as his eyes followed Glokta's\nstick. He blinked, the muscles of his face going slack. He stepped past the cripple\nwithout saying a word. His scarred jaw crept gradually open, and stayed there.\n'The enemy,' growled Varuz. Jezal tried to imagine what Logen Ninefingers would\nhave said faced with the sight below him now.\n'Shit.'\nIn the patchwork of damp fields, over the roads and through the hedgerows,\nbetween the farms and villages and the few coppices of old trees beyond the city\nwalls, Gurkish troops swarmed in their thousands. The wide paved road towards\nKeln, curving away southwards through the flat farmland, was a single crawling,\nglittering, heaving river of marching men. Gurkish soldiers, in column, flooding up\nand flowing smoothly out to encircle the city in a giant ring of men, wood, and steel.\nTall standards stood out above the boiling throng, golden symbols flashing in the\nwatery autumn sunlight. The standards of the Emperor's legions. Jezal counted ten at\nhis first glance.\n'A considerable body of men,' said Bayaz, with awesome understatement.\nGlokta grinned. 'The Gurkish hate to travel alone.'\nThe fence that Marshal Varuz had referred to earlier was already rising, a dark line\nwinding through the muddy fields a few hundred strides from the walls, a shallow\nditch in front of it.

More than adequate to prevent supplies or reinforcements\nreaching the city from outside. Further away several camps were taking shape: vast\nbodies of white tents erected in neatly ordered squares, several with tall columns of\ndark smoke already floating up into the white sky from cook-fires and forges. There\nwas a deeply worrying feeling of permanence about the whole arrangement. Adua\nmight still have been in Union hands, but even the most patriotic liar could not have\ndenied that the city's hinterland already belonged firmly to the Emperor of Gurkhul.\n'You have to admire their organisation,' said Varuz grimly.\n'Yes… their organisation…' Jezal's voice was suddenly creaky as old\nfloorboards. Putting a brave face on this seemed more like insanity than courage.\nA dozen horsemen had detached themselves from the Gurkish lines and now\nrode forward at a steady trot. Two long flags streamed above their heads, red and\nyellow silk, worked with Kantic characters in golden thread. There was a white flag\ntoo, so small as to be barely noticeable.\n'Parleys,' growled the First of the Magi, slowly shaking his head.\n'What are they but an excuse for old fools who love to hear their own voices to\nprattle about fair treatment before they start on the butchery?'\n'I suppose on the subject of old fools who love to hear their own voices, you are\nthe absolute expert.' That was what Jezal thought but he kept it to himself, watching\nthe Gurkish party approach in brooding silence. A tall man came at their head, gold\nshining on his sharply pointed helmet and his polished armour, riding with that\nupright arrogance that shouts, even from a distance, of high command.\nMarshal Varuz frowned. 'General Malzagurt.'\n'You know him?'\n'He commanded the Emperor's forces, during the last war. We grappled with\neach other for months. We parleyed more than once. A most cunning opponent.'\n'You got the better of him though, eh?'\n'In the end, your Majesty.' Varuz looked far from happy. 'But I had an army\nthen.'\nThe Gurkish commander clattered up the road, through the jumble of deserted\nbuildings scattered beyond Casamir's wall. He reined in his horse before the gate,\nstaring proudly upwards, one hand resting casually on his hip.\n'I am General Malzagurt,' he called in a sharp Kantic accent, 'the chosen\nrepresentative of his magnificence, Uthman-ul-Dosht, Emperor of Gurkhul.'\n'I am King Jezal the First.'\n'Of course. The bastard.'\nIt was pointless to deny it. 'That's right. The bastard. Why don't you come in,\nGeneral? Then we can speak face to face, like civilised men.'\nMalzagurt's eyes flickered across to Glokta. 'Forgive me, but the response of\nyour government to unarmed emissaries of the Emperor has not always been…\ncivilised. I think I will remain outside the walls. For now.'\n'As you wish.

I do not know your other—'\n'He is Bayaz. First of the Magi.' A smooth, even voice. It came from one of\nMalzagurt's companions. A man dressed all in simple white, somewhat in the manner\nof a priest. He seemed hardly older than Jezal, and very handsome, with a dark face,\nperfectly smooth. He wore no armour, carried no weapon. There was no adornment\non his clothes or his simple saddle. And yet the others in the party, even Malzagurt\nhimself, seemed to look at him with great respect. With fear, almost.\n'Ah.' The General peered up, stroking thoughtfully at his short grey beard. 'So\nthis is Bayaz.'\nThe young man nodded. 'This is he. It has been a long time.'\n'Not long enough, Mamun, you damned snake!' Bayaz clung to the parapet, teeth\nbared. The old Magus was so good at playing the kindly uncle that Jezal had\nforgotten how terrifying his sudden fury could be. He took a shocked step away,\nhalf raising a hand to shield his face. The Gurkish aides and flag-carriers cringed,\none going so far as to be noisily sick. Even Malzagurt lost a sizeable chunk of his\nheroic bearing.\nBut Mamun gazed up just as levelly as before. 'Some among my brothers thought\nthat you would run, but I knew better. Khalul always said your pride would be the\nend of you, and here is the proof. It seems strange to me, now, that I once thought\nyou a great man. You look old, Bayaz. You have dwindled.'\n'Things seem smaller when they are far above you!' growled the First of the Magi.\nHe ground the toe of his staff into the stones under his feet, his voice carrying now a\nterrible menace. 'Come closer, Eater, and you can judge my weakness while you\nburn!'\n'The time was you could have crushed me with a word, I do not doubt it. But\nnow your words are only empty air. Your power has leaked away with the slow\nyears, while mine has never been greater. I have a hundred brothers and sisters\nbehind me. What allies have you, Bayaz?' He swept the battlements with a mocking\nsmile. 'Only such as you deserve.'\n'I may yet find allies to surprise you.'\n'I doubt it. Long ago, Khalul told me what your final, desperate hope would be.\nTime proved him right, as it always has. So you went to the very edge of the World,\nchasing shadows. Dark shadows indeed, for one who calls himself righteous. I know\nthat you failed.' The priest showed two rows of perfect white teeth. 'The Seed\npassed out of history, long ago.

Sunk, far\nbelow the bottomless ocean. Your hopes are sunk with it. You have only one choice\nleft to you. Will you come with us willingly, and be judged by Khalul for your\nbetrayal? Or must we come in and take you?'\n'You dare to speak to me of betrayal? You who betrayed the highest principals of\nour order, and broke the sacred law of Euz? How many have you murdered, so that\nyou could be powerful?'\nMamun only shrugged. 'Very many. I am not proud. You left us a choice of dark\npaths, Bayaz, and we made the sacrifices we had to. There is no purpose in our\narguing over the past. After these long centuries, standing on opposite sides of a\ngreat divide, I think neither one of us will convince the other. The victors can decide\nwho was right, just as they always have, since long before the Old Time. I know\nyour answer already, but the Prophet would have me ask the question. Will you\ncome to Sarkant, and answer for your great crimes? Will you be judged by Khalul?'\n'Judged?' snarled Bayaz. 'He will judge me, the swollen-headed old murderer?' He\nbarked harsh laughter down from the walls. 'Come and take me if you dare, Mamun,\nI will be waiting!'\n'Then we will come,' murmured Khalul's first apprentice, frowning up from under\nhis fine black brows. 'We have been preparing long years to do it.'\nThe two men fell to sullen glaring, and Jezal frowned with them. He resented the\nsudden feeling that the whole business was somehow an argument between Bayaz\nand this priest and that he, although a king, was like a child eavesdropping on his\nparents' conversation, and with just as little say in the outcome.\n'Speak your terms, General!' he bellowed down.\nMalzagurt cleared his throat. 'Firstly, if you surrender the city of Adua to the\nEmperor, he is prepared to allow you to retain your throne, as his subject, of course,\npaying regular tribute.'\n'How generous of him. What of the traitor, Lord Brock? We understood that you\nhave promised him the crown of the Union.'\n'We are not altogether committed to Lord Brock. He does not hold the city, after\nall. You do.'\n'And we have scant respect for those who turn on their own masters,' added\nMamun, with a dark look up at Bayaz.\n'Secondly, the citizens of the Union will be permitted to continue to live\naccording to their own laws and customs. They will continue to live in freedom. Or\nas close to it as they have ever really been, at least.'\n'Your generosity is astonishing.' Jezal had meant to sneer it, but in the end it\nescaped without much irony.\n'Thirdly,' shouted the General, with a nervous glance sideways towards Mamun,\n'the man known as Bayaz, the First of the Magi, be delivered over to us, bound and\nin chains, that he may be conveyed to the Temple of Sarkant, for judgement by the"

        "text": "'the man known as Bayaz, the First of the Magi, be delivered over to us, bound and\nin chains, that he may be conveyed to the Temple of Sarkant, for judgement by the\nProphet Khalul. Those are our terms. Refuse them, and the Emperor has decreed\nthat Midderland shall be treated as any other conquered province. Many will be\nkilled, and many more made slaves, Gurkish governors will be installed, your Agriont\nwill be made a temple, and your current rulers… conveyed to cells beneath the\nEmperor's palace.'\nJezal half opened his mouth to refuse on an instinct. Then he paused. Harod the\nGreat, no doubt, would have spat his defiance at any odds, and probably pissed on\nthe emissary to boot. The slightest notion of negotiating with the Gurkish was against\nevery long-held belief he possessed.\nBut, thinking about it, the terms were far more generous than he had ever\nexpected. Jezal would probably have enjoyed more authority as a subject of\nUthman-ul-Dosht than he did with Bayaz staring over his shoulder every moment of\nevery day. He could save lives by saying a word. Real lives, of real people. He\nreached up and rubbed gently at his scarred lips with a fingertip. He had experienced\nenough suffering on the endless plains of the Old Empire to think long and hard\nabout risking so much pain to so many, and himself in particular. The notion of cells\nbeneath the Emperor's palace caused him some pause.\nIt was bizarre that such a vital decision should fall to him. A man who, no more\nthan a year ago, had proudly confessed to knowing nothing about anything, and\ncaring still less. But then Jezal was beginning to doubt that anyone in a position of\nhigh authority ever really knew what they were doing. The best one could hope for\nwas to maintain some shred of an illusion that one might. And occasionally, perhaps,\ntry to give the mindless flood of events the slightest push in one direction or another,\nhoping desperately that it would turn out to be the right one.\nBut what was the right one?\n'Give me your answer!' shouted Malzagurt. 'I have preparations to make!'\nJezal frowned. He was sick of being dictated to by Bayaz, but at least the old\nbastard had played some role in his ascension to the throne. He was sick of being\nslighted by Terez, but at least she was his wife. Quite aside from any other\nconsideration, his patience was stretched very thin. He simply refused to be ordered\naround at sword-point by some posturing Gurkish General and his damn fool priest.\n'I reject your terms!' he called airily down from the walls. 'I reject them utterly and\ncompletely. I am not in the habit of surrendering my advisers, or my cities, or my\nsovereignty simply when asked. Particularly not to a pack of Gurkish curs with small\nmanners and even smaller wits. You are not in Gurkhul now, General, and here your\narrogance becomes you even less than that absurd helmet. I suspect that you will\nlearn a harsh lesson before you leave these shores. Might I add, before you scuttle\noff, that I encourage you and your priest to fuck each other? Who knows? Perhaps\nyou could persuade the great Uthman-ul-Dosht—and the all-knowing Prophet Khalul"

Perhaps\nyou could persuade the great Uthman-ul-Dosht—and the all-knowing Prophet Khalul\ntoo for that matter—to join you!'\nGeneral Malzagurt frowned. He conferred quickly with an aide, evidently having\nnot entirely understood the finer points of that last utterance. Once he had finally\ntaken them in he gave an angry slash of his dark hand and barked an order in Kantic.\nJezal saw men moving among the buildings scattered outside the walls, torches in\ntheir hands. The Gurkish General took one last look up at the gatehouse. 'Damn\npinks!' he snarled. 'Animals!' And he tore at the reins of his horse and sprang away,\nhis officers clattering after him.\nThe priest Mamun sat there a moment longer, a sadness on his perfect face. 'So\nbe it. We will put on our armour. May God forgive you, Bayaz.'\n'You need forgiveness more than I, Mamun! Pray for yourself!'\n'So I do. Every day. But I have seen no sign in all my long life that God is the\nforgiving kind.' Mamun turned his horse away from the gates and rode slowly back\ntowards the Gurkish lines, through the abandoned buildings, flames already licking\nhungrily at their walls.\nJezal took a long, ragged breath as his eyes flicked up to the mass of men moving\nthrough the fields. Damn his mouth, it got him in all kinds of trouble. But it was a\nlittle late now for second thoughts. He felt Bayaz' fatherly touch on his shoulder, that\nsteering touch that had become so very annoying to him over the past few weeks. He\nhad to grit his teeth to keep from shaking free.\n'You should address your people,' said the Magus.\n'What?'\n'The right words could make all the difference. Harod the Great could speak at a\nmoment's notice. Did I tell you of the time he—'\n'Very well!' snapped Jezal, 'I am going.'\nHe walked towards the opposite parapet with all the enthusiasm of a condemned\nman to his scaffold. The crowd was spread out below in all its disturbing variety.\nJezal had to stop himself fussing with his belt-buckle. He kept worrying for some\nreason that his trousers would fall down in front of all those people. A ridiculous\nnotion. He cleared his throat. Someone saw him, pointed.\n'The king!'\n'King Jezal!'\n'The king speaks!'\nThe crowd shifted and stretched, drawn towards the gatehouse, a sea of hopeful,\nfearful, needy faces. The noise in the square slowly died and a breathless silence fell.\n'My friends… my countrymen… my subjects!' His voice rang out with pleasing\nauthority. A good beginning, very… rhetorical. 'Our enemies may be many… very\nmany…' Jezal cursed to himself. That was hardly an admission to give courage to\nthe masses. 'But I urge you to take heart! Our defences are strong!' He slapped at\nthe firm stones under his hand. 'Our courage is indomitable!' He thumped at his\npolished breastplate. 'We will hold firm!' This was better! He had discovered a\nnatural talent for speaking. The crowd was warming to him now, he could feel it."

There was a wave of angry muttering.\n'Er…' Jezal, wrong-footed, glanced nervously across at Bayaz, 'er…'\n'When will they come? When?' The First of the Magi hissed at Glokta, and the\ncripple made a sharp gesture to someone below.\n'Soon! You may depend upon it!' Curse Bayaz, this had been an awful notion.\nJezal did not have the ghost of an idea of how to put heart into a rabble.\n'What about our children? What about our homes? Will your house burn? Will\nit?' A swell of unhappy calls went up.\n'Do not fear! I beg of you… please…' Damn it! He had no business pleading, he\nwas a king. 'The army is on its way!' Jezal noticed black figures forcing through the\npress. Practicals of the Inquisition. They converged, somewhat to his relief, on the\npoint where the heckles were coming from. 'They are even now leaving the North!\nAny day they will come to our aid, and teach these Gurkish dogs a—'\n'When?

He was warming to his work, now, the words were spilling out as if he really\nmeant them. Perhaps he did. 'We will fight as we did in the days of Harod! Of\nArnault! Of Casamir!' A rousing cheer went up. 'We will not rest until these Gurkish\ndevils are driven back across the Circle Sea!

For every room!'\n'For every house!' someone squealed with rabid excitement, and the citizens of\nAdua bellowed their approval.\nFeeling the moment upon him, Jezal slid his sword from its sheath with a suitably\nwarlike ringing and held it high above his head. 'And I will be proud to draw my\nsword beside you! We will fight for each other! We will fight for the Union! Every\nman… every woman… a hero!'\nThere was a deafening cheer.

The people loved him,\nand were more than willing to fight for him. Together they would be victorious, he\nfelt it. He had made the right decision.\n'Nicely done,' murmured Bayaz in his ear. 'Nicely—'\nJezal's patience was worn out. He rounded on the Magus with his teeth bared. 'I\nknow how it was done! I have no need of your constant—'\n'Your Majesty.' It was Gorst's piping voice.\n'How dare you interrupt me? What the hell is—'\nJezal's tirade was cut off by a ruddy glare at the corner of his eye, followed a\nmoment later by a roaring detonation. He jerked his head round to see flames\nspringing up above the jumble of roofs some distance away on his right. Below in\nthe square there was a collective gasp, a wave of nervous movement through the\ncrowd.\n'The Gurkish bombardment has begun,' said Varuz.\nA streak of fire shot up into the white sky above the Gurkish lines. Jezal watched\nit open-mouthed as it plummeted down towards the city. It crashed into the\nbuildings, this time on Jezal's left, bright fire shooting high into the air. The terrifying\nboom assaulted his ears an instant afterward.\nShouts came from below. Orders, perhaps, or screams of panic. The crowd\nbegan to move in every direction at once. People rushed for the walls, or for their\nhomes, or nowhere in particular, a chaotic tangle of pressing bodies and waving\npolearms.\n'Water!' someone shouted.\n'Fire!'\n'Your Majesty.' Gorst was already leading Jezal back towards the stairway. 'You\nshould return to the Agriont at once.'\nJezal started at another thunderous explosion, this one even closer. Smoke was\nalready rising in oily smudges over the city. 'Yes,' he muttered, allowing himself to\nbe led to safety. He realised that he still had his sword drawn, and sheathed it\nsomewhat guiltily. 'Yes of course.'\nFearlessness, as Logen Ninefingers had once observed, is a fool's boast.\nA Rock and a Hard Place\n« ^ »\nGlokta shook with laughter, wheezing gurgles slobbering through his empty gums,\nthe hard chair creaking under his bony arse. His coughs and his whimpers echoed\ndully from the bare walls of his dim living room. In a way, it sounded very much like\nweeping. And perhaps it is, just a little.\nEvery shake of his twisted shoulders drove nails into his neck. Every jerk of his\nrib-cage sent flashes of pain down to the very tips of such toes as he had left.

And yet it is not so very difficult to stop. After all,\nnothing is really very funny here, is it?He. lifted the letter, and read it again.\nSuperior Glokta,\nMy employers at the banking house of Valint and Balk are more than\ndisappointed with your progress. It is some time now since I asked you, in person,\nto inform us of Arch Lector Sult's plans. In particular, the reasons for his\ncontinuing interest in the University. Since then we have received no\ncommunication from you.\nIt may be that you believe the sudden arrival of the Gurkish beyond the city walls\nhas altered the expectations of my employers.\nIt has not, in any way whatsoever. Nothing will.\nYou will report to us within the week, or his Eminence will be informed of your\ndivided loyalties.\nI need hardly add that it would be wise for you to destroy this letter.\nMauthis.\nGlokta stared at the paper for a long while by the light of the single candle, his ruined\nmouth hanging open. For this, I lived through months of agony in the darkness of\nthe Emperor's prisons? Tortured my savage way through the Guild of Mercers?\nSlaughtered my bloody path through the city of Dagoska? To end my days in\nignominy, trapped between a bitter old bureaucrat and a tank full of treacherous\nswindlers? All my twisting, my lying my bargains, and my pain. All those corpses\nleft beside the road… for this?\nA new wave of laughter rocked his body, twisted him up and made his aching\nback rattle. His Eminence and these bankers deserve each other! Even with the city\nburning down around them, their games cannot stop for an instant. Games which\nmay very well prove fatal to poor Superior Glokta, who only tried to do his\ncrippled best. He had to wipe a little snot from under his nose he laughed so hard at\nthat last thought.\nIt almost seems a shame to burn such a horribly hilarious document. Perhaps I\nshould take it to the Arch Lector instead? Would he see the funny side, I wonder?\nWould we chuckle over it together? He reached out and held the corner of the letter\nto the twisting candle flame, watched fire flicker up the side, creep out through the\nwriting, white paper curling up into black ashes.\nBurn, as my hopes, and my dreams, and my glorious future burned beneath\nthe Emperor's palace! Burn, as Dagoska did and Adua surely will before the\nEmperor's fury! Burn, as I would love to burn King Jezal the Bastard, and the\nFirst of the Magi, and Arch Lector Sult, and Valint and Balk, and the whole\ndamned—\n'Gah!'

However much pain we\nexperience, we never become used to it. We always scramble to escape it. We never\nbecome resigned to more. The corner of the letter was still smouldering on the floor.\nHe frowned, and ground it out with a savage poke of his cane.\nThe air was heavy with the sharp tang of wood smoke. Like a hundred thousand\nburnt dinners. Even here in the Agriont, there was the slightest grey haze of it, a\nmessy blending together of the buildings at the end of each street. Fires had been\nraging in the outer districts for several days now, and the Gurkish bombardment had\nnot let up a hair, night or day. Even as Glokta walked, the breath wheezing through\nthe gaps in his teeth with the effort of putting one foot in front of the other, there\ncame the muffled boom of an incendiary landing somewhere in the city, the tiniest\nmurmur of vibration through the soles of his boots.\nThe people in the lane froze, staring up in alarm. Those few unlucky folk who\nfound themselves without excuses to flee the city when the Gurkish came. Those\nunlucky folk who were too important, or not important enough. An optimistic\nhandful who thought the Gurkish siege would be another passing fad—like a rain\nstorm or short trousers. Too late they discover their grave error.\nGlokta kept hobbling, head lowered. He had not lost a wink of sleep for the\nexplosions rocking the city in the darkness the past week. I was too busy losing\nsleep for my mind spinning round and round like a cat in a sack, trying to find\nsome way clear of this trap. I became well-used to explosions during my holiday in\ncharming Dagoska. For him, the pain lancing through his arse and up his spine was\nconsiderably more worrisome.\nOh, arrogance! Who would ever have dared suggest that Gurkish boots would\none day trample across the fertile fields of Midderland? That the pretty farms and\nsleepy villages of the Union would dance with Gurkish fire? Who could ever have\nexpected that beautiful, thriving Adua would turn from a little piece of heaven into\na little piece of hell? Glokta felt himself smiling. Welcome, everyone! Welcome! I've\nbeen here all along. How nice of you to join me.\nHe heard armoured boots tramping down the road behind him, shuffled too late\nout of the way of a hurrying column of soldiers and was barged roughly onto the\ngrassy verge, left foot sliding in the mud and sending a stab of agony up his leg. The\ncolumn clattered past, heedless, and Glokta grimaced after them. People no longer\nhave the proper level of fear for the Inquisition. They are all a great deal too\nafraid of the Gurkish for that. He stepped away from the wall with a wince and a\ncurse, stretched his neck out and carried on limping.\nHigh Justice Marovia was framed in the largest window of his echoing office, hands\nclasped behind his back.

Above the rooftops in the distance, columns of dark smoke rose\ninto the pale sky, blending together into a gritty pall that rendered the autumn\nhalf-light still more funereal. Marovia turned when he heard Glokta's toeless foot\ncreaking on the dark boards, his lined old face alive with a welcoming smile.\n'Ah, Superior Glokta! You cannot imagine my delight to hear you announced! I\nhave missed you since your last visit. I do so enjoy your… forthright style. I do so\nadmire your… commitment to your work.' He flapped one lazy hand towards the\nwindow. 'The law, I must admit, tends to be sleepy in times of war. But even with\nthe Gurkish at the gates the noble business of his Majesty's Inquisition continues,\neh? I assume you have come once again on behalf of his Eminence?'\nGlokta paused. But only out of habit. I must turn my twisted back on the\nInquisition. What would Sult call me? A traitor? No doubt, and worse besides. But\nevery man's first loyalty must be to himself. I have made my sacrifices. 'No, your\nWorship. I have come on behalf of Sand dan Glokta.' He limped up to a chair, slid it\nout and dumped himself into it without being asked. I am far past the niceties, now.\n'Frankly, I need your help.' Frankly, you are my last hope.\n'My help? Surely you are not without powerful friends of your own?'\n'It is my regrettable experience that powerful men can afford no friends.'\n'All too unfortunately true. You do not reach my position, or even yours, without\nunderstanding that each man stands alone, in the end.' Marovia gazed down\nbeneficently as he settled into his own tall chair. Though I am far from put at ease.\nHis smiles are every bit as deadly as Sult's frowns, I think. 'Our friends must be\nthose that can make themselves useful to us. With that in mind, what help can I offer\nyou? And more importantly, what can you offer me in return?'\n'That may take some explaining.' Glokta winced at a cramp in his leg and forced\nit out straight under the table. 'May I speak entirely honestly with you, your\nWorship?'\nMarovia stroked thoughtfully at his beard. 'The truth is a very rare and valuable\ncommodity. I am astonished that a man of your experience would simply give it\naway. Especially to someone on the other side of the fence, so to speak.'\n'I was once told that a man lost in the desert must take such water as he is\noffered, regardless of the source.'\n'Lost, are you? Speak honestly, then, Superior, and we will see if I can spare\nsomething from my canteen.'\nHardly a promise of succour, but the best I might have hoped for from a man\nso recently a bitter enemy. And so… my confession. Glokta turned over the\nmemories of the last couple of years in his mind. And a filthy, a shameful, an ugly\nset they are. Where to begin? 'It is some time ago, now, that I began to examine\nirregularities in the business of the Honourable Guild of Mercers.'"

Dagoska was riddled with treason and surrounded by the Gurkish.'\nMarovia snorted.

But an unlikely benefactor\nstepped forward in my time of need.'\n'A rich uncle? What a happy chance.'\n'Not entirely.' Glokta licked at the salty space where his front teeth had once\nbeen. And the secrets begin to spill like turds from a draining latrine-pit. 'My rich\nuncle was none other than the banking house of Valint and Balk.'\nMarovia frowned. 'They advanced you money?'\n'It was thanks to their generosity that I was able to keep the Gurkish out as long\nas I did.'\n'Bearing in mind that powerful people have no friends, what did Valint and Balk\nget in return?'\n'In essence?' Glokta gave the High Justice an even stare. 'Whatever they wanted.\nShortly after returning from Dagoska I was investigating the death of Crown Prince\nRaynault.'\n'A terrible crime.'\n'Of which the Gurkish ambassador who hung for it was innocent.'\nMarovia registered the tiniest hint of surprise. 'You say so?'\n'Undoubtedly. But the death of the heir to the throne created other problems,\nproblems relating to votes in the Open Council, and his Eminence was happy with\nthe easy answer. I tried to pursue the matter, but was prevented. By Valint and Balk.'\n'You suspect that these bankers were involved in the death of the Crown Prince,\nthen?'\n'I suspect them of all manner of things, but proof is in short supply.'

Most particularly, he is not happy\nwith the influence that Bayaz exerts over him. Sult finds his powers much curtailed.\nHe believes, in fact, that you are somehow behind the whole business.'\nMarovia frowned. 'Does he now?'\nHe does, and I am not entirely sure that I discount the possibility. 'He has asked\nme to find some means of removing Bayaz…' His voice dropped almost to a\nwhisper. 'Or removing the king. I suspect, should I fail, that he has other plans. Plans\nwhich somehow involve the University.'\n'You would seem to be accusing his Eminence the Arch Lector of high treason\nagainst the state.' Marovia's eyes were bright and hard as a pair of new nails.\nSuspicious, and yet terribly eager. 'Have you uncovered anything to use against the\nking?'\n'Before I could even consider doing so, Valint and Balk quite forcibly dissuaded\nme.'\n'They knew so quickly?'\n'I am forced to concede that someone close to me may not be as reliable as I\nhave always hoped. The bankers not only demanded that I disobey his Eminence,\nthey also insisted that I investigate him. They want to know his plans. I have only a\nfew days to satisfy them, and Sult no longer trusts me enough to share the contents\nof his latrine with me, let alone the contents of his mind.'\n'Oh dear, dear.' Marovia slowly shook his head. 'Oh dear, dear.'\n'To add to my woes, I believe that the Arch Lector is considerably less ignorant\nof what occurred in Dagoska than he at first appeared. If somebody is talking, it may\nwell be that they are talking to both sides.' If you can betray a man once, after all, it\nis not so very difficult to do it twice. Glokta gave a long sigh.

A signed\nconfession would be best.'\n'Sult's signed confession?' murmured Glokta.\n'Such a document would seem to solve some problems for both of us. Sult\nwould be gone, and the bankers would have lost their hold over you. The Gurkish\nwould still be camped outside our walls of course, but one can't have everything.'\n'The Arch Lector's signed confession.' And shall I pluck the moon from the sky\nwhile I'm about it?\n'Or a big enough stone to start the landslide—perhaps the confession of someone\nsuitably close to him. I understand that you are expert at obtaining them.' The High\nJustice peered at Glokta from under his heavy brows. 'Was I misinformed?'\n'I cannot conjure evidence from thin air, your Worship.'\n'Those lost in the desert must take the chances they are offered, however slender.\nFind evidence, and bring it to me. Then I can act, and not one moment before. You\nunderstand that I cannot take any risks for you. It is difficult to trust a man who\nchose his master, and now chooses another.'\n'Chose?' Glokta felt his eyelid twitching again. 'If you believe that I chose any\npart of the pitiful shadow of a life you see before you, you are very much mistaken. I\nchose glory and success. The box did not contain what was written on the lid.'\n'The world is full of tragic tales.' Marovia walked to the window, turning his back\nand staring out at the darkening sky. 'Especially now. You can hardly expect them to\nmake any difference to a man of my experience. I wish you good day.'\nFurther comment seems pointless. Glokta rocked forwards, pushed himself\npainfully up to standing with the aid of his cane, and limped for the door. But the\ntiniest glimmer of hope has come creeping into the dank cellar of my despair… I\nneed only obtain a confession to High Treason from the head of his Majesty's\nInquisition—\n'And Superior!' Why can no one ever finish talking before I get up? Glokta\nturned back into the room, his spine burning. 'If someone close to you is talking,\nyou need to shut them up. Now. Only a fool would consider uprooting treason from\nthe Closed Council before he had cut the weeds from his own lawn.'\n'Oh, you need not worry about my garden, your Worship.' Glokta treated the"

'I am even now sharpening my shears.'\nCharity\n« ^ »\nAdua burned.\nThe two westernmost districts—the Three Farms, at the south-western corner of\nthe city, and the Arches, further north—were hacked with black wounds. Smoke\nwas still pouring up from some of them, great columns lit in faint orange near the\nbase. They spread out in oily smears, dragged away to the west by a stiff wind,\ndrawing a muddy curtain across the setting sun.\nJezal watched in solemn silence, his hands bunched into numb fists on the\nparapet of the Tower of Chains. There was no sound up here but for the wind\nfumbling at his ears and, just occasionally, the slightest hint of distant battle. A war\ncry, or the screams of the wounded. Or perhaps only a sea-bird calling, high on the\nbreeze. Jezal wished for a maudlin moment that he were a bird, and could simply fly\nfrom the tower and off over the Gurkish pickets, away from this nightmare. But\nescape would not be so easy.\n'Casamir's Wall was first breached three days ago,' Marshal Varuz was explaining\nin a monotonous drone. 'We drove back the first two assaults, and held the Three\nFarms that night, but the next day there was another breach, and another. This damn\nfire-powder has changed all the bloody rules. A wall that would have stood a week\nthey can bring down in an hour.'\n'Khalul always loved to tinker with his dust and his bottles,' muttered Bayaz,\nunhelpfully.\n'They were in the Three Farms in force that night, and carried the gates into the\nArches soon afterwards. Ever since, the whole western part of the city has been one\nrunning battle.' The tavern where Jezal had celebrated his victory over Filio in the\nContest was in that district. The tavern where he had sat with West and Jalenhorm,\nKaspa and Brint, before they went away to the North, and he to the Old Empire.\nWas that building now burning? Was it already a blackened shell?\n'We're fighting them hand to hand in the streets by daylight. We're mounting raids\nin the darkness, every night. Not a stride of ground is given up without it being\nsoaked with Gurkish blood.' Perhaps Varuz hoped to be inspiring, but he was only\nsucceeding in making Jezal feel sick. The streets of his capital soaked in blood,\nwhoever's blood it might have been, was hardly his first aim as king of the Union.\n'Arnault's Wall still stands firm, though there are fires burning in the centre of town.\nThe flames almost reached the Four Corners last night, but the rain doused them\ndown, at least for now. We're fighting for every street, every house, every room. Just\nas you said we should, your Majesty.'\n'Good,' Jezal managed to croak, but he almost choked on the word.\nWhen he so blithely turned down General Malzagurt's terms, he was not sure\nwhat he had been expecting.

That something heroic would occur. Only now the bloody business\nwas well underway, and there was no sign of instant deliverance. Probably there was\nheroism going on down there in the smoke. Soldiers hauling injured comrades to\nsafety through the sooty darkness. Nurses stitching wounds by screaming\ncandlelight. Townsfolk plunging into burning buildings to drag out coughing\nchildren. Heroism of an everyday and unglamorous kind. A kind that made no\ndifference to the overall outcome.\n'Are those our ships in the bay?' he asked quietly, already afraid of the answer.\n'I wish they were, your Majesty. I never thought I'd say it, but they have the best\nof us by sea. You never saw so many damn ships. Even if most of our navy weren't\nferrying the army back from Angland, I'm not sure what they could do. As it is, the\nmen will have to be landed outside the city. It's a damned inconvenience, and it\ncould get to be a great deal more than that. The docks are a weak spot. Sooner or\nlater they may try to land men there.'\nJezal looked nervously towards the water. Armies of Gurkish, pouring from their\nships and into the heart of the city. The Middleway cut straight through the centre of\nAdua from the bay to the Agriont. A road invitingly wide enough to march an entire\nGurkish legion straight down in a twinkling. He shut his eyes and tried to breathe\nevenly.\nBefore the arrival of the Gurkish he had hardly been able to have a moment's\nsilence for the opinions of his councillors. Now that he actually needed advice, the\ntorrent had suddenly run dry. Sult rarely appeared in the Closed Council, and then\nonly to glare at Marovia. The High Justice himself had little to offer beyond\nbemoaning the fix they were all in. Even Bayaz' stock of historical examples seemed\nfinally to be exhausted. Jezal was left to carry the responsibility alone, and he was\nfinding it quite a weight. He supposed it was a good deal more unpleasant for those\nthat were actually wounded, or homeless, or killed, but that was slender consolation.\n'How many are dead already?' he found himself asking, like a child picking at a\nscab. 'How many have we lost?'\n'The righting along Casamir's Wall was fierce. The fighting throughout the\noccupied districts has been fiercer yet. Casualties on both sides are heavy. I would\nguess at a thousand dead at least on our side.'\nJezal swallowed sour spit. He thought about the mismatched defenders he had\nseen near the western gate, in a square now presumably overrun by Gurkish legions.\nOrdinary people, who had looked to him with hope and pride. Then he tried to\npicture what a thousand corpses might look like. He imagined a hundred of them,\nside by side, in a row. Then ten such rows, one above the other. A thousand. He\ngnawed at his thumbnail, already down to the painful quick.\n'And many more wounded, of course,' added Varuz, in a sudden twist of the"

'We are very short of space for them, in fact. Two districts are at least partly\noccupied by the Gurkish and the enemy are landing incendiaries almost in the heart\nof the city.' Jezal's tongue sought out the still sore gap in his teeth. He remembered\nhis own pain, out on the endless plain under the merciless sky, the stabs through his\nface as the cartwheels squeaked and jolted.\n'Open the Agriont to the wounded, to the homeless. With the army away there is\nroom to spare. Barracks for thousands, and ample provisions.'\nBayaz was shaking his bald head. 'A risk. We have no way of knowing who we\nwould be letting in. Gurkish agents. Spies of Khalul. Not all of them are what they\nappear.'\nJezal ground his teeth. 'I am prepared to take the risk. Am I king here, or not?'\n'You are,' growled Bayaz, 'and you would be well advised to act like it. This is no\ntime for sentiment. The enemy are closing on Arnault's Wall. In places they might be\nwithin two miles of where we stand.'\n'Two miles?' murmured Jezal, his eyes flickering nervously towards the west\nagain. Arnault's Wall was a fine grey line through the buildings, looking a terribly frail\nsort of a barrier from up here, and worryingly close. A sudden fear gripped him. Not\nthe guilty concern he felt for the theoretical people down there in the smoke, but a\nreal and very personal fear for his own life. Like the one he had felt among the\nstones, when the two warriors advanced on him with murder in mind. Perhaps he\nhad made a mistake not leaving the city when he had the chance. Perhaps it was not\ntoo late to—\n'I will stand or fall alongside the people of the Union!' he shouted, as angry at his\nown cowardice as he was at the Magus. 'If they are willing to die for me, then I am\nwilling to die for them!' He turned his shoulder towards Bayaz and quickly looked\naway. 'Open the Agriont, Marshal Varuz. You can fill the palace with wounded too,\nif you have to.'\nVaruz glanced nervously sideways at Bayaz, then gave a stiff bow. 'Hospitals will\nbe set up in the Agriont, then, your Majesty. The barracks will be opened to the\npeople. The palace we had probably better leave sealed, at least until things get\nworse.'\nJezal could hardly bear to imagine what worse might look like. 'Good, good. See\nit done.' He had to wipe a tear from under his eye as he turned away from the\nsmouldering city and made for the long stair. The smoke, of course. Nothing but the\nsmoke.\nQueen Terez sat alone, framed in the window of their vast bedchamber.\nThe Countess Shalere was still lurking around the palace somewhere, but it\nseemed she had learned to keep her scorn well out of Jezal's way. The rest of Terez'\nladies she had sent back to Styria before the Gurkish blockaded the harbour. Jezal"

Jezal\nrather wished that he could have returned the queen herself along with the rest but\nthat, unfortunately, was not an option.\nTerez did not so much as glance in his direction as Jezal shut the door. He had to\nstifle a heavy sigh as he trudged across the room, his boots muddy from the spitting\nrain, his skin greasy from the soot in the air outside.\n'You are treading dirt with you,' said Terez, without looking round, her voice as\nicy as ever.\n'War is a dirty business, my love.' He saw the side of her face twitch with disgust\nwhen he said the last two words, and hardly knew whether he wanted to laugh or cry\nat it. He dropped down heavily in the chair opposite her without touching his boots,\nknowing all the while that it would infuriate her. There was nothing he could do that\nwould not.\n'Must you come to me in this manner?' she snapped.\n'Oh, but I could not stay away! You are my wife, after all.'\n'Not by choice.'\n'It was not my choice either, but I am willing to make the best of things! Believe it\nor not I would rather have married someone who did not hate me!' Jezal shoved one\nhand through his hair and pressed his anger down with some difficulty. 'But let us\nnot fight, please. I have enough fighting to do out there. More than I can stand! Can\nwe not, at least… be civil to one another?'\nShe looked at him for a long moment, a thoughtful frown on her face. 'How can\nyou?'\n'How can I what?'\n'Keep trying.'\nJezal ventured a fragment of a grin. 'I had hoped that you might come to admire\nmy persistence, if nothing else.' She did not smile, but he sensed, perhaps, the\nslightest softening of the hard line of her mouth. He hardly dared suppose that she\nmight have finally begun to thaw, but he was willing to seize on the slightest shred of\nhope. Hope was in short supply, these days. He leaned towards her, staring earnestly\ninto her eyes. 'You have made it clear that you think very little of me, and I suppose\nthat I hardly blame you. I do not think so very much of myself, believe me. But I am\ntrying… I am trying very hard… to be a better man.'\nThe corner of Terez' mouth twitched up in a sad kind of smile, but a kind of\nsmile nonetheless. To his great surprise she reached out, and placed one hand\ntenderly on his face. His breath caught in his throat, skin tingling where her fingertips\nrested.\n'Why can you not understand that I despise you?' she asked. He felt himself go\nvery cold. 'I despise the look of you, the feel of you, the sound of your voice. I\ndespise this place and its people. The sooner the Gurkish burn it all to the ground\nthe happier I'll be.' She took her hand away and turned back to the window, a\nglimmering of light down her perfect profile."

'I think I will find another room to sleep in tonight. This\none is altogether too cold.'\n'At last.'\nIt can be a terrible curse for a man to get everything he ever dreamed of. If the\nshining prizes turn out somehow to be empty baubles, he is left without even his\ndreams for comfort. All the things that Jezal had thought he wanted—power, fame,\nthe beautiful trappings of greatness—they were nothing but dust. All he wanted now\nwas for things to be as they had been, before he got them. But there was no way\nback. Not ever.\nHe really had nothing further to say. He turned stiffly and trudged for the door.\nBetter Left Buried\n« ^ »\nWhen the fighting is over you dig, if you're still alive. You dig graves for your dead\ncomrades. A last mark of respect, however little you might have had for them. You\ndig as deep as you can be bothered, you dump them in, you cover them up, they rot\naway and are forgotten. That's the way it's always been.\nThere would be a lot of digging when this fight was done. A lot of digging for\nboth sides.\nTwelve days, now, since the fire started falling. Since the wrath of God began to\nrain on these arrogant pinks, and lay blackened waste to their proud city. Twelve\ndays since the killing started—at the walls, and in the streets, and through the\nhouses. For twelve days in the cold sunlight, in the spitting rain, in the choking\nsmoke, and for twelve nights by the light of flickering fires, Ferro had been in the\nthick of it.\nHer boots slapped against the polished tiles, leaving black marks down the\nimmaculate hallway behind her. Ash. The two districts where the fighting was raging\nwere covered in it, now. It had mingled with the thin rain to make a sticky paste, like\nblack glue. The buildings that still stood, the charred skeletons of the ones that did\nnot, the people who killed and the people who died, all coated in it. The scowling\nguards and the cringing servants frowned at her and the marks she left, but she had\nnever cared a shit for their opinions, and was not about to start. They would have\nmore ash than they knew what to do with soon. The whole place would be ash, if the\nGurkish got their way.\nAnd it looked very much as if they might. Each day and each night, for all the\nefforts of the rag-tag defenders, for all the dead they left among the ruins, the\nEmperor's troops worked their way further into the city.\nTowards the Agriont.\nYulwei was sitting in the wide chamber when she got there, shrunken into a chair\nin one corner, the bangles hanging from his limp arms. The calmness which had\nalways seemed to swaddle him like an old blanket was stripped away. He looked\nworried, worn, eyes sunken in dark sockets. A man looking defeat in the face.

I always said that you would kill the whole\nworld if you could, and now you have your chance. How do you like war, Ferro?'\n'Well enough.' She tossed her bow rattling onto a polished table, dragged her\nsword out of her belt, shrugged off her quiver. She had only a few shafts left. Most\nof them she had left stuck through Gurkish soldiers, out there in the blackened ruins\nat the edge of the city.\nBut Ferro could not bring herself to smile.\nKilling Gurkish was like eating honey. A little only left you craving more. Too\nmuch could become sickening. Corpses had always been a poor reward for all the\neffort it took to make them. But there was no stopping now.\n'You are hurt?'\nFerro squeezed at the filthy bandage round her arm, and watched the blood seep\nout into the grey cloth. There was no pain. 'No,' she said.\n'It is not too late, Ferro. You do not need to die here. I brought you. I can still\ntake you away. I go where I please, and I take who I please with me. If you stop\nkilling now, who knows? Perhaps God will still find a place in heaven for you.'\nFerro was becoming very tired of Yulwei's preaching. She and Bayaz might not\nhave trusted each other a finger's breadth, but they understood each other. Yulwei\nunderstood nothing.\n'\"Heaven\"?' she sneered as she turned away from him. 'Perhaps hell suits me\nbetter, did you think of that?'\nShe hunched up her shoulders as footsteps echoed down the hallway outside.\nShe felt Bayaz' anger even before the door was flung open and the old bald pink\nstormed into the room.\n'That little bastard! After all that I have given him, how does he repay me?' Quai\nand Sulfur slunk through the doorway behind him like a pair of dogs creeping after\ntheir master. 'He defies me before the Closed Council! He tells me to mind my\nbusiness! Me! How would that cringing dunce know what is my business and what\nis not?'\n'Trouble with King Luthar the Magnificent?' grunted Ferro.\nThe Magus narrowed his eyes at her. 'A year ago there was no emptier head in\nthe whole Circle of the World. Stick a crown on him and have a crowd of old liars\ntongue his arse for a few weeks and the little shit thinks he's Stolicus!'\nFerro shrugged. Luthar had never lacked a high opinion of himself, king or not.\n'You should be more careful who you stick crowns on.'\n'That's the trouble with crowns, they have to go on someone. All you can do is\ndrop them in a crowd and hope for the best.' Bayaz scowled over at Yulwei. 'What\nof you brother? Have you been walking outside the walls?'\n'I have.'\n'And what have you seen?'\n'Death. Much of that. The Emperor's soldiers flood into the western districts of\nAdua, his ships choke the bay. Every day more troops come up the road from the\nsouth, and tighten the Gurkish grip on the city.'"

He and his brothers, and his sisters, they\nhave a great tent outside the bounds of the city. They pray for victory, they listen to\nsweet music, they bathe in scented water, they laze naked and enjoy the pleasures of\nthe flesh.

In brazen mockery of the solemn word of Euz. Making ready for the moment\nwhen they will come to seek you out. The moment for which Khalul made them.\nThey think it will not be long, now. They polish their armour.'\n'Do they indeed?' hissed Bayaz. 'Damn them then.'\n'They have damned themselves already. But that is no help to us.'\n'Then we must visit the House of the Maker.' Ferro's head jerked up. There was\nsomething about that great, stark tower that had fascinated her ever since she first\narrived in Adua. She found her eyes always drawn towards its mountainous bulk,\nrising untouchable, high above the smoke and the fury.\n'Why?' asked Yulwei. 'Do you plan to seal yourself inside? Just as Kanedias did,\nall those years ago, when we came seeking our vengeance? Will you cower in the\ndarkness, Bayaz? And this time, will you be the one thrown down, to break upon the\nbridge below?'\nThe First of the Magi snorted. 'You know me better than that. When they come\nfor me I will face them in the open. But there are still weapons in the darkness. A\nsurprise or two from the Maker's forge for our cursed friends beyond the walls.'\nYulwei looked even more worried than before. 'The Divider?'\n'One edge here,' whispered Quai from the corner. 'One on the Other Side.'\nBayaz, as usual, ignored him. 'It can cut through anything, even an Eater.'\n'Will it cut through a hundred?' asked Yulwei.\n'I will settle for Mamun alone.'\nYulwei slowly unfolded himself from the chair, stood with a sigh.\n'Very well, lead on. I will enter the Maker's House with you, one last time.'\nFerro licked her teeth. The idea of going inside was irresistible. 'I will come with\nyou.'\nBayaz glared back. 'No, you will not. You can stay here and sulk. That has\nalways been your special gift, has it not? I would hate to deny you the opportunity to\nmake use of it. You will come with us,' he snapped at Quai. 'You have your\nbusiness, eh, Yoru?'\n'I do, Master Bayaz.'\n'Good.' The First of the Magi strode from the room with Yulwei at his shoulder,"

Sulfur did not move. Ferro frowned at him, and\nhe grinned back, his head tipped against the panelled wall, his chin pointed towards\nthe moulded ceiling.\n'Are these Hundred Words not your enemies too?' Ferro demanded.\n'My deepest and most bitter enemies.'\n'Why do you not fight, then?'\n'Oh, there are other ways to fight than struggling in the dirt out there.' There was\nsomething in those eyes, one dark, one bright, that Ferro did not like the look of.\nThere was something hard and hungry behind his smiles. 'Though I would love to\nstay and chat, I must go and give the wheels another push.' He turned a finger round\nand round in the air. 'The wheels must keep turning, eh, Maljinn?'\n'Go then,' she snapped. 'I will not stop you.'\n'You could not if you wanted to. I would bid you a good day. But I'd wager\nyou've never had one.' And he sauntered out, the door clicking to behind him.\nFerro was already across the room, shooting back the bolt on the window. She\nhad done as Bayaz told her once before, and it had brought her nothing but a wasted\nyear. She would make her own choices now. She jerked the hangings aside and\nslipped out onto the balcony. Curled-up leaves blew on the wind, whipping around\nthe lawns below along with the spitting rain. A quick glance up and down the damp\npaths showed only one guard, and he was looking the wrong way, huddled in his\ncloak.\nSometimes it is best to seize the moment.\nFerro swung her legs over the rail, gathered herself, then sprang out into the air.\nShe caught a slippery tree branch, swung to the trunk, slid down it to the damp earth\nand crept behind a neatly clipped hedge, low to the ground.\nShe heard footsteps, then voices. Bayaz' voice, and Yulwei's, speaking soft into\nthe hissing wind. Damn, but these old fools of Magi loved to flap their lips.\n'Sulfur?' came Yulwei's voice. 'He is still with you?'\n'Why would he not be?'\n'His studies ran in… dangerous directions. I told you this, brother.'\n'And? Khalul is not so picky with his servants…'\nThey passed out of earshot and Ferro had to rush along behind the hedge to keep\npace, staying bent double.\n'… I do not like this habit,' Yulwei was saying, 'of taking forms, of changing skin.\nA cursed discipline. You know what Juvens' feelings were on it—'\n'I have no time to worry on the feelings of a man centuries in his grave. There is\nno Third Law, Yulwei.'\n'Perhaps there should be. Stealing another's face… the tricks of Glustrod and his\ndevil-bloods. Arts borrowed from the Other Side—'\n'We must use such weapons as we can find. I have no love for Mamun, but he is\nright.

She gave them a few moments,\nthen she started up and strode after, shoulders back, as though she was about\nimportant business. She felt the hard stares of the armoured men flanking the gate,\nbut they were used to her coming and going now. For once they kept their silence.\nBetween the great buildings, around the statues, through the dull gardens she\nfollowed the two Magi and their apprentice across the Agriont. She kept her\ndistance, loitering in doorways, under trees, walking close behind those few people\nhurrying down the windy streets. Sometimes, above the buildings in a square, or at\nthe end of a lane, the top of the great mass of the Maker's House reared up. Hazy\ngrey through the drizzle to begin with, but growing more black, vast and distinct with\neach stride she took.\nThe three men led her to a ramshackle building with crumbling turrets sticking\nfrom its sagging roof. Ferro knelt and watched from behind a corner while Bayaz\nbeat on the rickety door with the end of his staff.\n'I am glad you did not find the Seed, brother,' said Yulwei, while they waited.\n'That thing is better left buried.'\n'I wonder if you will still think so when the Hundred Words swarm through the\nstreets of the Agriont, howling for our blood?'\n'God will forgive me, I think. There are worse things than Khalul's Eaters.'\nFerro's nails dug into her palms. There was a figure standing at one of the grimy\nwindows, peering out at Yulwei and Bayaz. A long, lean figure with a black mask\nand short hair. The woman who had chased her and Ninefingers, long before.\nFerro's hand strayed on an instinct towards her sword, then she realised she had left\nit in the palace, and cursed her foolishness. Ninefingers had been right. You could\nnever have too many knives.\nThe door wobbled open, some words were muttered, the two old men went\nthrough, Quai at their back, head bowed. The masked woman watched for a while\nlonger, then stepped back from the window into the darkness. Ferro sprang over a\nhedge as the door wobbled closed, wedged her foot in the gap and slid through\nsideways, stealing into the deep shadows on the other side. The door clattered shut\non its creaking hinges.\nDown a long hallway, dusty paintings on one wall, dusty windows in the other.\nAll the way the back of Ferro's neck prickled, waiting for the black masks to come\nboiling out of the shadows. But nothing came besides the echoing footsteps up\nahead, the mindless droning of the old men's voices.\n'This place has changed,' Yulwei was saying. 'Since that day we fought Kanedias.\nThe day the Old Time ended. It rained, then.'\n'I remember it.'"

It rained, then.'\n'I remember it.'\n'I lay wounded on the bridge, in the rain. I saw them fall, the Maker and his\ndaughter. From on high, they tumbled down. Hard to believe, that I smiled to see it,\nthen. Vengeance is a fleeting thrill. The doubts, we carry to our graves.' Ferro\nsneered at that. If she could have the vengeance she would live with the doubts.\n'Time has brought us both regrets,' muttered Bayaz.\n'More of them with every passing year. A strange thing, though. I could have\nsworn, as I lay there, that it was Kanedias who fell first, and Tolomei second.'\n'Memory can tell lies, especially to men who have lived as long as we. The Maker\nthrew down his daughter, then I him. And so the Old Time ended.'\n'So it did,' murmured Yulwei. 'So much lost. And now we are come to this…'\nQuai's head snapped round and Ferro plastered herself against the wall behind a\nleaning cabinet. He stood there, for a long moment, frowning towards her. Then he\nfollowed the others. Ferro waited, holding her breath, until the three of them turned a\ncorner and passed out of sight.\nShe caught them up in a crumbling courtyard, choked with dead weeds, littered\nwith broken slates fallen from the roofs above. A man in a stained shirt led them up a\nlong stairway, towards a dark arch high in the high wall of the Agriont. He had a\nbunch of jingling keys in his gnarled hands, was muttering something about eggs.\nOnce they had passed into the tunnel Ferro padded across the open space and up\nthe steps, pausing near the top.\n'We will come back shortly,' she heard Bayaz growling. 'Leave the door ajar.'\n'It's always kept locked,' a voice answered. 'That's the rule. It's been kept locked\nall my life, and I don't plan to—'\n'Then wait here until we come back! But go nowhere! I have many better things\nto do than sit waiting on the wrong side of your locked doors!' Keys turned. Old\nhinges squealed. Ferro's fingers slid round a loose lump of stone and gripped it\ntightly.\nThe man in the dirty shirt was pulling the gates shut as she crept to the top of the\nsteps. He muttered angrily as he fumbled with his keys, metal clinking. There was a\ndull thump as the stone clubbed him across his bald spot. He gasped, lurched\nforward, Ferro caught his limp body under the arms and lowered him carefully to the\nground.\nThen she set the rock down and relieved him of his keys with a hooked finger.\nAs Ferro lifted her hand to push the doors open, a strange sensation washed over\nher. Like a cool breeze on a hot day, surprising, at first, then delightful. A shiver, not\nat all unpleasant, worked its way up her spine and made her breath catch. She\npressed her hand to the weathered wood, the grain brushing warm and welcoming\nagainst her palm. She eased the door open just wide enough to peer through."

She eased the door open just wide enough to peer through.\nA narrow bridge sprang out from the wall of the Agriont, no more than a stride\nacross, without rail or parapet. At the far end it met the side of the Maker's\nHouse—a soaring cliff of bare rock, shining black with the rain. Bayaz, Yulwei and\nQuai stood before a gate at the end of that strip of stone. A gate of dark metal,\nmarked in the centre with bright circles. Rings of letters that Ferro did not\nunderstand. She watched Bayaz pull something out from the collar of his shirt. She\nwatched the circles begin to move, to turn, to spin, her heart pounding in her ears.\nThe doors moved silently apart. Slowly, reluctantly, almost, the three men passed\ninto that square of blackness, and were gone.\nThe House of the Maker stood open.\nGrey water slapped at hard stone below as Ferro followed them across the\nbridge. The rain kissed and the wind nipped at her skin. In the distance, smudges of\nsmoke rose from the smouldering city and into the muddy sky, but her eyes were\nfixed on the yawning portal straight ahead. She loitered on the threshold for a\nmoment, her hands clenched into fists.\nThen she stepped into the darkness.\nIt was neither cold nor warm on the other side of the gate. The air was so still,\nand flat, and silent that it seemed to weigh heavily on Ferro's shoulders, to press at\nher ears. A few muffled steps and the light had all faded. Wind, and rain, and the\nopen sky were dimly remembered dreams. She felt she walked a hundred miles\nbeneath the dead earth. Time itself seemed to have stopped. Ferro crept up to a wide\narchway and peered through.\nThe hall beyond was like a temple, but it would have swallowed whole even the\ngreat temple in Shaffa, where thousands called hourly out to God. It dwarfed the\nlofty dome where Jezal dan Luthar had been given a crown. It was an expanse that\nmade even the vastness of ruined Aulcus seem petty. A place crowded with solemn\nshadows, peopled with sullen echoes, bounded by angry, unyielding stone. The\ntomb of long-dead giants.\nThe grave of forgotten gods.\nYulwei and Bayaz stood at its centre. Tiny, insect figures in an ocean of gleaming\ndarkness. Ferro pressed herself to the cold rock, striving to pick their words out\nfrom the sea of echoes.\n'Go to the armoury and find some of the Maker's blades. I will go up, and\nbring… that other thing.'\nBayaz turned away, but Yulwei caught him by the arm. 'First answer me one\nquestion, brother.'\n'What question?'\n'The same one I always ask.'\n'Again? Even now? Very well, if you must. Ask.'\nThe two old men stood still for the longest time. Until the last echoes had faded\nand left only a silence as heavy as lead. Ferro held her breath.\n'Did you kill Juvens?' Yulwei's whisper hissed through the darkness. 'Did you kill\nour master?'"

'Did you kill\nour master?'\nBayaz did not flinch. 'I made mistakes, long ago. Many mistakes, I know. Some\nout in the ruined west. Some here, in this place. The day does not pass when I do\nnot regret them. I fought with Khalul. I ignored my master's wisdom. I trespassed in\nthe House of the Maker. I fell in love with his daughter. I was proud, and vain, and\nrash, all this is true. But I did not kill Juvens.'\n'What happened that day?'\nThe First of the Magi spoke the words as though they were lines long rehearsed.\n'Kanedias came to take me. For seducing his daughter. For stealing his secrets.\nJuvens would not give me up. They fought, I fled. The fury of their battle lit the\nskies. When I returned, the Maker was gone, and our master was dead. I did not kill\nJuvens.'\nAgain a long silence, and Ferro watched, frozen. 'Very well.' Yulwei let fall his\nhand from Bayaz' arm. 'Mamun lied, then. Khalul lied. We will fight against them\ntogether.'\n'Good, my old friend, good. I knew that I could trust you, as you can trust me.'\nFerro curled her lip. Trust. It was a word that only liars used. A word the truthful\nhad no need of. The First of the Magi's footsteps rang out as he strode towards one\nof the many archways and vanished into the gloom.\nYulwei watched him go. Then he gave a sharp sigh, and padded off in the other\ndirection, his bangles jingling on his thin arms. The echoes of his passing slowly\nfaded, and Ferro was left alone with the shadows, wrapped in silence.\nSlowly, carefully, she crept forwards into that immense emptiness. The floor\nglittered—snaking lines of bright metal, set into the black rock. The ceiling, if there\nwas one, was shrouded in darkness. A high balcony ran around the walls a good\ntwenty strides up, another far above that, then another, and another, vague in the\nhalf-light. Above all, a beautiful device hung. Rings of dark metal, great and small,\ngleaming discs and shining circles, marked with strange writings. All moving. All\nrevolving, one ring about the other, and at their centre a black ball, the one point of\nperfect stillness.\nShe turned round, and round, or perhaps she stood still and the room turned\nabout her. She felt dizzy, drunken, breathless. The bare rock soared away into the\nblack, rough stones without mortar, no two alike. Ferro tried to imagine how many\nstones the tower was made of.\nThousands. Millions.\nWhat had Bayaz said, on the island at the edge of the World? Where does the\nwise man hide a stone? Among a thousand. Among a million. The rings high above\nshifted gently. They pulled at her, and the black ball in the centre pulled at her most\nof all. Like a beckoning hand. Like a voice calling out her name."

Like a voice calling out her name.\nShe dug her fingers into the dry spaces between the stones and began to climb,\nhand over hand, up and up. It was easily done. As though the wall was meant to be\nclimbed. Soon she swung her legs over the metal rail of the first balcony. On again,\nwithout pausing for breath, up and up. She reached the second balcony, sticky with\nsweat in the dead air. She reached the third, breath rasping. She gripped the rail of\nthe fourth, and pulled herself over. She stood, staring down.\nFar below, at the bottom of a black abyss, the whole Circle of the World lay on\nthe round floor of the hall. A map, the coastlines picked out in shining metal. Level\nwith Ferro, filling almost all the space within the gently curving gallery, suspended on\nwires no thicker than threads, the great mechanism slowly revolved.\nShe frowned at the black ball in its centre, her palms tingling. It seemed to hover\nthere, without support. She should have wondered how that could be, but all she\ncould think about was how much she wanted to touch it. Needed to. She had no\nchoice. One of the metal circles drifted close to her, gleaming dully.\nSometimes it is best to seize the moment.\nShe sprang up onto the rail, crouched there for an instant, gathering herself. She\ndid not think. Thinking would have been madness. She leapt into empty space, limbs\nflailing. The whole machine wobbled and swayed as she caught hold of its outermost\nring. She swung underneath, hanging breathless. Slowly, delicately, her tongue\npressed into the roof of her mouth, she pulled herself up by her arms, hooked her\nlegs over the metal and dragged herself along it. Soon it brought her close to a wide\ndisc, scored with grooves, and she clambered from one to the other, body trembling\nwith effort. The cool metal quivered under her weight, twisting and flexing, wobbling\nwith her every movement, threatening to shrug her off into the empty void. Ferro\nmight have had no fear in her.\nBut plunges of a hundred strides onto the hardest of hard rock still demanded her\ndeep respect.\nSo she slithered out, from one ring to another, hardly daring even to breathe. She\ntold herself there was no drop. She was only climbing trees, sliding between their\nbranches, the way she had when she was a child, before the Gurkish came. Finally\nshe caught hold of the innermost ring. She clung to it, furious tight, waiting until its\nown movement brought her close to the centre. She hung down, legs crossed\naround the frail metal, one hand gripping it, the other reaching out towards that\ngleaming black ball.\nShe could see her rigid face reflected in its perfect surface, her clawing hand,\nswollen and distorted. She strained forward with every nerve, teeth gritted. Closer,\nand closer yet. All that mattered was to touch it. The very tip of her middle finger\nbrushed against it and, like a bubble bursting, it vanished into empty mist.\nSomething dropped free, falling, slowly, as if it sank through water. Ferro"

Ferro\nwatched it tumble away from her, a darker spot in the inky darkness, down, and\ndown. It struck the floor with a boom that seemed to shake the very foundations of\nthe Maker's House, filled the hall with crashing echoes. The ring that Ferro clung to\ntrembled and for a giddy instant she nearly lost her grip. When she managed to haul\nherself back she realised that it had stopped moving.\nThe whole device was still.\nIt seemed to take her an age to clamber back across the motionless rings to the\ntopmost gallery, to make the long descent down the towering walls. When she finally\ndropped to the floor of the cavernous chamber her clothes were torn, her hands,\nelbows, knees grazed and bloody, but she scarcely noticed. She ran across the wide\nfloor, her footsteps ringing out. Towards the very centre of the hall, where the thing\nthat had fallen from above still lay.\nIt looked like nothing more than an uneven chunk of dark stone the size of a big\nfist. But this was no stone, and Ferro knew it. She felt something leaking from it,\npouring from it, flooding out in thrilling waves. Something that could not be seen, or\ntouched, and yet filled the whole space to its darkest reaches. Invisible, yet\nirresistible, it flowed tingling around her and dragged her forwards.\nFerro's heart thumped at her ribs as her footsteps drew close. Her mouth flooded\nwith hungry spit as she knelt beside it. Her breath clawed in her throat as she reached\nout, palm itching. Her hand closed around its pocked and pitted surface. Very\nheavy, and very cold, as if it were a chunk of frozen lead. She lifted it slowly up,\nturning it in her hand, watching it glitter in the darkness, fascinated.\n'The Seed.'\nBayaz stood in one of the archways, face trembling with an ugly mixture of\nhorror and delight. 'Leave, Ferro, now! Take it to the palace.' He flinched, raised one\narm, as if to shield his eyes from a blinding glare. 'The box is in my chambers. Put it\ninside, and seal it tight, do you hear me? Seal it tight!'\nFerro turned away, scowling, not sure now which of the archways led out of the\nMaker's House.\n'Wait!' Quai was padding across the floor towards her, his gleaming eyes fixed\non her hand. 'Stay!' He showed no trace of fear as he came closer. Only an awful\nkind of hunger, strange enough that Ferro took a step away. 'It was here. Here, all\nalong.' His face looked pale, slack, full of shadows. 'The Seed.' His white hand crept\nthrough the darkness towards her. 'At last. Give it to—'\nHe crumpled up like discarded paper, was ripped from his feet and flung away\nthe whole width of the vast room in the time it took Ferro to drag in one stunned\nbreath. He hit the wall just below the lowest balcony with an echoing crunch. She\nwatched open-mouthed as his shattered body bounced off and tumbled to the\nground, broken limbs flopping."

She\nwatched open-mouthed as his shattered body bounced off and tumbled to the\nground, broken limbs flopping.\nBayaz stepped forward, his staff clenched tightly in his fist. The air around his\nshoulders was still shimmering ever so slightly. Ferro had killed many men, of\ncourse, and shed no tears. But the speed of this shocked even her.\n'What did you do?' she hissed, the echoes of Quai's fatal impact with the far wall\nstill thudding about them.\n'What I had to. Get to the palace. Now.' Bayaz stabbed at one of the archways\nwith a heavy finger, and Ferro saw the faintest glimmer of light inside it. 'Put that\nthing into the box! You cannot imagine how dangerous it is!'\nFew people liked taking orders less, but Ferro had no wish to stay in this place.\nShe stuffed the lump of rock down inside her shirt. It felt right there, pressed against\nher stomach. Cool and comforting, for all Bayaz called it dangerous. She took one\nstep, and as her boot slapped down a grating chuckle floated up from the far side of\nthe hall.\nFrom where Quai's ruined corpse had fallen.\nBayaz did not seem surprised. 'So!' he shouted. 'You show yourself at last! I\nhave suspected for some time that you were not who you appeared to be! Where is\nmy apprentice, and when did you replace him?'\n'Months ago.' Quai was still chuckling as he pushed himself slowly up from the\npolished floor. 'Before you left on your fool's errand to the Old Empire.' There was\nno blood on his smiling face. Not so much as a graze. 'I sat beside you, at the fire. I\nwatched you while you lay helpless in that cart. I was with you all the way, to the\nedge of the World and back. Your apprentice stayed here. I left his half-eaten corpse\nin the bushes for the flies, not twenty strides from where you and the Northman\nsoundly slept.'\n'Huh.' Bayaz tossed his staff from one hand to the other. 'I thought I noted a\nsharp improvement in your skills. You should have killed me then, when you had the\nchance.'\n'Oh, there is time now.' Ferro shivered as she watched Quai stand. The hall\nseemed to have grown suddenly very cold.\n'A hundred words? Perhaps. One word?' Bayaz' lip curled. 'I think not. Which of\nKhalul's creatures are you? The East Wind? One of those damned twins?'\n'I am not one of Khalul's creatures.'\nThe faintest flicker of doubt passed over Bayaz' face. 'Who, then?'\n'We knew each other well, in times long past.'\nThe First of the Magi frowned. 'Who are you? Speak!'\n'Taking forms.' A woman's voice, soft and low. Something was happening to\nQuai's face as he paced slowly forward. His pale skin drooped, twisted. 'A dread\nand insidious trick.' His nose, his eyes, his lips began to melt, running off his skull\nlike wax down a candle. 'Do you not remember me, Bayaz?' Another face showed\nitself beneath, a hard face, white as pale marble.

Bayaz took a faltering step back.\n'You look surprised. Not as surprised as I was, when instead of taking me in your\narms you threw me down from the roof, eh, my love? And why? So that you could\nkeep your secrets? So that you could seem noble?' Quai's long hair had turned white\nas chalk. It floated now about a woman's face, terribly pale, eyes two bright, black\npoints. Tolomei. The Maker's daughter. A ghost, stepped out of the faded past. A\nghost that had walked beside them for months, wearing a stolen shape. Ferro could\nalmost feel her icy breath, cold as death on the air. Her eyes flickered from that pale\nface to the archway, far away across the floor, caught between wanting to run, and\nneeding to know more.\n'I saw you in your grave!' whispered Bayaz. 'I piled the earth over you myself.'\n'So you did, and wept when you did, as though you had not been the one to\nthrow me down.' Her black eyes swivelled to Ferro, to where the Seed lay tingling\nagainst her belly. 'But I had touched the Other Side. In these two hands I had held it,\nwhile my father worked, and it had left me altered. There I lay, in the earth's cold\nembrace. Between life and death. Until I heard the voices. The voices that Glustrod\nheard, long ago. They offered me a bargain. My freedom for theirs.'\n'You broke the First Law!'\n'Laws mean nothing to the buried! When I finally clawed my way from the\ngrasping earth the human part of me was gone. But the other part, the part that\nbelongs to the world below—that cannot die. It stands before you. Now I will\ncomplete the work that Glustrod began. I will throw open the doors that my\ngrandfather sealed. This world and the Other Side shall be one. As they were before\nthe Old Time. As they were always meant to be.' She held out her open hand, and a\nbitter chill flowed from it and sent shivers across Ferro's back to the tips of her\nfingers. 'Give me the Seed, child. I made a promise to the Tellers of Secrets, and I\nkeep the promises I make.'\n'We shall see!' snarled the First of the Magi. Ferro felt the tugging in her stomach,\nsaw the air around Bayaz begin to blur. Tolomei stood ten strides away from him.\nThe next instant she struck him with a sound like a thunderclap. His staff burst apart,\nsplintered wood flying. He gave a shocked splutter as he flew through the darkness,\nrolled over and over across the cold stone to lie face down in a crumpled heap.\nFerro stared as a wave of freezing air washed over her. She felt a sick and terrible\nfear, all the worse for being unfamiliar. She stood frozen."

Harsh light flickered to the furthest corners of the\ncavernous chamber, brightness stabbed into the very cracks between the stones.\nFerro stumbled back, holding one hand over her eyes. Between her fingers she saw\nTolomei reel madly across the floor, thrashing and dancing, white flames wreathing\nher body, her hair a coiling tongue of fire.\nShe flopped to the ground, the darkness closing back in, smoke pouring up in a\nreeking cloud. Yulwei padded out from one of the archways, his dark skin shining\nwith sweat. He held a bundle of swords under one scrawny arm. Swords of dull\nmetal, like the one that Ninefingers had carried, each marked with a single silver\nletter. 'Are you alright, Ferro?'\n'I…' The fire had brought no warmth with it. Ferro's teeth were rattling, the hall\nhad grown so cold. 'I…'\n'Go.' Yulwei frowned at Tolomei's body as the last flames died. Ferro finally\nfound the strength to move, began to back away. She felt a bitter sinking in her gut\nas she watched the Maker's daughter climb up, the ash of Quai's clothes sliding from\nher body. She stood, tall and deathly lean, naked and as bald as Bayaz, her hair all\nseared away to grey dust. There was not so much as a mark on her corpse-pale skin,\ngleaming flawless white.\n'Always there is something more.' She glared at Yulwei with her flat black eyes.\n'No fire can burn me, conjuror. You cannot stop me.'\n'But I must try.' The Magus flung his swords into the air. They turned, spun,\nedges glittering, spreading apart in the darkness, drifting impossibly sideways. They\nbegan to fly around Yulwei and Ferro in a whirling circle. Faster and faster until they\nwere a blur of deadly metal. Close enough that if Ferro had reached out, her hand\nwould have been snatched off at the wrist.\n'Stand still,' said Yulwei.\nThat hardly needed saying. Ferro felt a surge of anger, hot and familiar. 'First I\nshould run, then stand still? First the Seed is at the Edge of the World, and now it is\nhere at the centre? First she is dead and now she has stolen another's face? You old\nbastards need to get your stories straight.'\n'They are liars!' snarled Tolomei, and Ferro felt the cold of her freezing breath\nwash over her cheek and chill her to the bone. 'Users! You cannot trust them!'\n'But I can trust you?' Ferro snorted her contempt. 'Fuck yourself!'"

'You cannot keep juggling your knives forever, old man.'\nOver her white shoulder, Ferro saw Bayaz get slowly to his feet, holding one arm\nwith the other, rigid face scratched and bloody. Something dangled from his limp\nfist—a long mass of metal tubes with a hook on the end, dull metal gleaming in the\ndarkness. His eyes rolled to the far-off ceiling, veins bulging from his neck with\neffort as the air began to twist around him. Ferro felt that sucking in her gut and her\neyes were drawn upwards. Up to the great machine that hung above their heads. It\nbegan to tremble.\n'Shit,' she muttered, starting to back away.\nIf Tolomei noticed, she showed no sign. She bent her knees and sprang high into\nthe air, a white streak over the spinning swords. She hung above for an instant, then\nplummeted down towards Yulwei. She crashed into the floor, knees first, the impact\nmaking the ground shake. A splinter of stone grazed Ferro's cheek and she felt a\nblast of icy wind against her face, lurched a step back.\nThe Maker's daughter frowned up. 'You do not die easily, old man,' she snarled\nas the echoes faded.\nFerro could not tell how Yulwei had avoided her, but now he danced away, his\nhands moving in slow circles, bangles jingling, swords still tumbling through the air\nbehind him. 'I have been working at it all my life. You do not die easily either.'\nThe Maker's daughter stood and faced him. 'I do not die.'\nHigh above the huge device lurched, cables pinging as they snapped, whipping in\nthe darkness. With an almost dreamlike slowness, it began to fall. Glittering metal\ntwisted, flexed, shrieked as it tumbled down. Ferro turned and ran. Five breathless\nstrides and she flung herself down, sliding flat on her face across the polished rock.\nShe felt the Seed digging into her stomach, the wind of the spinning swords ripping\nclose to her back as she passed just beneath them.\nThe great machine hit the floor behind her with a noise like the music of hell. Each\nring made a vast cymbal, a giant's gong. Each struck its own mad note, a screaming,\nclanging, booming of tortured metal, loud enough to make every one of Ferro's\nbones buzz. She looked up to see one great disc reel past her, clattering on its edge,\nstriking bright sparks from the floor. Another flew into the air, spinning crazily like a\nflipped coin. She gasped as she rolled out of its way, scrambled back as it crashed\ninto the ground beside her.\nWhere Yulwei and Tolomei had faced each other there was a hill of twisted metal,\nof broken rings and leaning discs, bent rods and tangled cables.

As she sprang up\nher fist already swinging, all the fury of her wasted months, her wasted years, her\nwasted life behind it. Her knuckles hit Tolomei's jaw with a sharp crunch. It was like\npunching a block of ice. There was no pain as her hand broke, but she felt her wrist\nbuckle, her arm go numb. Too late to worry on it. Her other fist was on its way.\nTolomei snatched her arm from the air before it touched her, dragged Ferro\nclose, twisting her helpless onto her knees with awful, irresistible strength. 'The\nSeed!' The hissing words froze across Ferro's face, snatching her breath out in a\nsick groan, her skin burning where Tolomei held her. She felt her bones twist, then\nsnap, her forearm clicking sideways like a broken stick. A white hand crept through\nthe shadows towards the lump in Ferro's shirt.\nThere was a sudden light, a brilliant curve of it that lit the whole chamber for a\nblinding instant. Ferro heard a piercing shriek and she was free, sprawling on her\nback. Tolomei's hand was sliced off cleanly just above the wrist, leaving a bloodless\nstump. A great wound was scored down the smooth wall and deep into the floor,\nmolten stone running from it, bubbling and sizzling. Smoke curled from the strange\nweapon in Bayaz' hand as he lurched from the shadows, the hook at its end still\nglowing orange. Tolomei gave an icy scream, one hand clawing at him.\nBayaz roared mindlessly back at her, his eyes narrowed, his bloody mouth wide\nopen. Ferro felt a twisting at her stomach, so savage she was bent over, almost\ndragged to her knees. The Maker's daughter was snatched up and blasted away, one\nwhite heel tearing a long scar through the map on the floor, gouging through rock\nand ripping up metal."

Tolomei was a flailing\nshape in a storm of flying metal. She hit the distant wall with an earth-shaking boom,\nflinging out chunks of broken stone. A hail of twisted fragments rattled, rang,\nclanged against the rock around her. Rings, pins, slivers like dagger blades wedged\ninto the wall, making the whole great curve of stone a giant bed of nails.\nBayaz' eyes bulged, his gaunt face wet with sweat. 'Die, devil!' he bellowed.\nDust filtered down, rock began to shift. Cold laughter echoed out across the hall.\nFerro scrambled back, heels kicking at the smooth stone, and she ran. Her broken\nhand shuddered over the wall of the tunnel, her broken arm dangled. A square of\nlight came jolting towards her. The door of the Maker's House.\nShe tottered out into the air, stinging bright after the shadows, the thin rain warm\nafter Tolomei's freezing touch. The Seed still weighed heavy in her shirt, rough and\ncomforting against her skin.\n'Run!' came Bayaz' voice from the darkness. 'To the palace!' Ferro tottered\nacross the bridge, clumsy feet slipping on wet stone, cold water lurching far below.\n'Put it in the box, and seal it tight!' She heard an echoing boom behind her, metal\nclashing against metal, but she did not look back.\nShe shouldered her way through the open doors in the wall of the Agriont, nearly\ntripping over the doorman, sitting against the wall where she had left him with one\nhand clasped to his head. She sprang over him as he cringed away, flew down the\nsteps three at a time, across the crumbling courtyard, down the dusty corridors,\nsparing no thought for masked figures or for anyone else. They seemed a pitiful,\neveryday sort of threat, now. She could still feel the icy breath on her neck.\nNothing mattered but to put it far behind her.\nShe slid up to the door, fumbled at the bolt with the heel of her broken hand,\nburst out into the drizzle and pounded down the wet streets the way she had come.\nThe people in the lanes and squares stumbled back out of her way, shocked at the\nsight of her, desperate and bloody. Angry voices echoed after her but she ignored\nthem, turned a corner onto a wide street between grey buildings and nearly slid right\nover on the wet stones.\nA great crowd of dishevelled people were choking the road. Women, children,\nold men, dirty and shambling.\n'Out of my way!' she screamed, and started to force a path through. 'Move!' The\nstory Bayaz had told on the endless plain nagged at the back of her mind. How the\nsoldiers had found the Seed in the ruins of Aulcus. How they had withered and died.\nShe pushed and kicked and shouldered her way through the press. 'Move!'

She tore\nfree of them and sprinted off down the empty street, her broken arm held against her\nbody, against the thing inside her shirt.\nShe ran across the park, leaves fluttering down from the trees with each chilly\ngust. The high wall of the palace rose up where the lawns ended and Ferro made for\nthe gate. The two guards still flanked it just as they always did, and she knew they\nwere watching her. They might have let her out, but they were not so keen on letting\nher in, especially filthy, bloody, covered in dirt and sweat, and running as if she had\na devil at her heels.\n'Wait, you!' Ferro made to duck past them but one grabbed hold of her.\n'Let me go you fucking pink fools!' she hissed. 'You don't understand!' She tried\nto twist away, and a gilded halberd fell to the ground as one of the guards wrapped\nhis arms around her.\n'Explain it, then!' snapped out from behind the visor of the other. 'Why the\nhurry?' His gauntleted fist reached out towards the bulge in her shirt. 'What have you\ngot—'\n'No!' Ferro hissed and squirmed, stumbled against the wall bearing one guard\nclanking back into the archway. The halberd of the other swung down smoothly, its\nglittering point levelled at Ferro's chest.\n'Hold still!' he growled, 'before I—'\n'Let her in! Now!' Sulfur stood on the other side of the gates, and for once he\nwas not smiling. The guard's head turned doubtfully towards him. 'Now!' he roared,\n'in the name of Lord Bayaz!'\nThey let her free and Ferro tore away, cursing. She ran through the gardens, into\nthe palace, boots echoing in the hallways, servants and guards moving suspiciously\nout of her way. She found the door of Bayaz' rooms and fumbled it open, stumbled\nthrough. The box sat open on a table near the window, an unremarkable block of\ndark metal. She strode across to it, unbuttoned her shirt and pulled out the thing\ninside.\nA dark, heavy stone, the size of a fist. Its dull surface was still cold, no warmer\nthan when she had first picked it up. Her hand tingled pleasantly, as if at the touch of\nan old friend. It made her angry, somehow, to even think of letting go.\nSo this, at last, was the Seed. The Other Side, made flesh. The very stuff of\nmagic. She remembered the blighted ruins of Aulcus. The dead expanse of the land\naround it, for a hundred miles in every direction. Power enough to send the\nEmperor, and the Prophet, and his cursed Eaters, and the whole nation of Gurkhul to\nhell, and more besides. Power so terrible that it should have belonged to God alone,\nheld now, in her frail fist. She stared down at it for a long time.

She dropped the Seed into its resting place, jerked her hand away with an\neffort and snapped the lid of the box closed. As if a candle flame had been suddenly\nblown out in a darkened room, the world seemed dimmer, weaker, robbed of\nexcitement. It was only then that she realised her hand was whole. She frowned\ndown at it, working her fingers. They moved as easily as ever, not the slightest\nswelling around knuckles she had been sure were shattered. Her other arm too, the\nforearm straight and smooth, no sign of a mark where Tolomei's freezing fingers had\ncrushed it. Ferro looked towards the box. She had always healed quickly. But bones\nset, within an hour?\nThat was not right.\nBayaz dragged himself grimacing through the doorway. There was dry blood\ncaked to his beard, a sheen of sweat across his bald head. He was breathing hard,\nskin pale and twitching, one arm pressed to his side. He looked like a man who had\nspent the afternoon fighting a devil, and had only just survived.\n'Where is Yulwei?'\nThe First of the Magi stared back at her. 'You know where he is.'\nFerro remembered the echoing bang as she ran from the tower. Like the sound of\na door being shut. A door that no blade, no fire, no magic could open. Bayaz alone\nhad the key. 'You did not go back. You sealed the gates with them inside.'\n'Sacrifices must be made, Ferro, you know this. I have made a great sacrifice\ntoday. My own brother.' The First of the Magi hobbled across the room towards\nher. 'Tolomei broke the First Law. She struck a deal with the Tellers of Secrets. She\nmeant to use the Seed to open the gates to the world below. She could be more\ndangerous than all of Khalul's Eaters. The House of the Maker must remain sealed.\nUntil the end of time, if need be. An outcome not without irony. She began her life\nimprisoned in that tower. Now she has returned. History moves in circles, just as\nJuvens always said. '\nFerro frowned. 'Fuck your circles, pink. You lied to me. About Tolomei. About\nthe Maker. About everything.'\n'And?'\nShe frowned even harder. 'Yulwei was a good man. He helped me in the desert.\nHe saved my life.'\n'And mine, more than once. But good men will only go so far along dark paths.'\nBayaz' bright eyes slid down to rest on the cube of dark metal under Ferro's hand.\n'Others must walk the rest of the way.'\nSulfur stepped through the doorway, and Bayaz pulled the weapon he had\nbrought from the House of the Maker from under his coat, grey metal glinting in the\nsoft light from the windows.

Then he nipped open his satchel and slid out the old\nblack book that Ferro had seen once before. 'Now?' he muttered.\n'Now.' Bayaz took it from him, placed his hand gently on the scarred cover,\nclosed his eyes and took a long breath. When he opened them he was looking\nstraight at Ferro. 'The paths we must walk now, you and I, are dark indeed. You\nhave seen it.'\nShe had no answer. Yulwei had been a good man, but the gate of the Maker's\nHouse was sealed, and he was gone to heaven, or to hell. Ferro had buried many\nmen, in many ways. One more pile of dirt in the desert was nothing to remark upon.\nShe was sick of stealing her revenge one grain at a time. Dark paths did not scare\nher. She had been walking them all her life. Even through the metal of the box, she\nthought that she heard the barest hint of a whisper, calling to her. 'All I want is\nvengeance.'\n'And you shall have it, just as I promised.'\nShe stood face to face with Bayaz, and she shrugged.

'You speak my very thoughts.'\nTomorrow's Hero\n« ^ »\nThe hooves of Jezal's grey charger clopped obediently in the black mud. It was a\nmagnificent beast, the very kind he had always dreamed of riding. Several thousand\nmarks-worth of horse flesh, he did not doubt. A steed that could give any man who\nsat on it, however worthless, the air of royalty. His shining armour was of the best\nStyrian steel, chased with gold. His cloak was of the finest Suljuk silk, trimmed with\nermine. The hilt of his sword was crusted with diamonds, twinkling as the clouds\nflowed overhead to let the sun peep through. He had foregone the crown today in\nfavour of a simple golden circlet, its weight considerably less wearisome on the sore\nspots he had developed round his temples.\nAll the trappings of majesty. Ever since he was a child, Jezal had dreamed of\nbeing exalted, worshipped, obeyed. Now the whole business made him want to be\nsick. Although that might only have been because he had scarcely slept last night,\nand scarcely eaten that morning.\nLord Marshal Varuz rode on Jezal's right, looking as if age had suddenly caught\nup with him. He seemed shrunken in his uniform, stooped and slump-shouldered.\nHis movements had lost their steely precision, his eyes their icy focus. He had\ndeveloped, somehow, the very slightest hint of not knowing what to do.\n'Fighting still continues in the Arches, your Majesty,' he was explaining, 'but we\nhave only toe-holds there. The Gurkish have the Three Farms under firm control.\nThey moved their catapults forward to the canal, and last night they threw\nincendiaries far into the central district. As far as the Middleway and beyond. Fires"

Fires\nwere burning until dawn. Still are burning, in some parts. The damage has been…\nextensive.'\nA crashing understatement. Whole sections of the city had been devastated by\nfire. Whole rows of buildings, that Jezal remembered as grand houses, busy taverns,\nclattering workshops, reduced to blackened wreckage. Looking at them was as\nhorrifying as seeing an old lover open their mouth to reveal two rows of shattered\nteeth. The reek of smoke, and burning, and death clawed constantly at Jezal's throat\nand had reduced his voice to a gravely croak.\nA man streaked with ash and dirt looked up from picking through the wreckage\nof a still-smoking house. He stared at Jezal and his guards as they trotted past.\n'Where is my son?' he shrieked suddenly. 'Where is my son?'\nJezal carefully looked away and gave his horse the slightest suggestion of a spur.\nHe did not need to offer his conscience any further weapons with which to stab at\nhim. It was already exceedingly well armed.\n'Arnault's Wall still holds, though, your Majesty.' Varuz spoke considerably\nlouder than was necessary in a futile effort to smother the heartbroken wails still\nringing through the ruins behind them. 'Not a single Gurkish soldier has yet set foot\nin the central district of the city. Not one.'\nJezal wondered how much longer they would be able to make that boast. 'Have\nwe received any news from Lord Marshal West?' he demanded for the second time\nthat hour, the tenth time that day.\nVaruz gave Jezal the same answer he would no doubt receive ten times more\nbefore descending into a fitful sleep that night. 'I regret that we are almost utterly cut\noff, your Majesty. News arrives but rarely through the Gurkish cordon. But there\nhave been storms off Angland. We must face the possibility that the army will be\ndelayed.'\n'Black luck,' murmured Bremer dan Gorst from the other side, his narrow eyes\nflickering endlessly over the ruins for the slightest sign of any threat. Jezal chewed\nworriedly at the salty remnant of his thumbnail. He could scarcely remember the last\nshred of good news. Storms. Delays. Even the elements were ranged against them, it\nseemed.\nVaruz had nothing to lift the mood. 'And now illness has broken out in the\nAgriont. A swift and merciless plague. A large group of the civilians to whom you\nopened the gates have succumbed, all at once. It has extended to the palace itself.\nTwo Knights of the Body have already died from it. One day they were standing\nguard at the gate, as always. The next night they were in their coffins. Their bodies\nwithered, their teeth rotted, their hair fell out. The corpses are burned, but more\ncases appear. The physicians have never seen the like before, have no notion of a\ncure. Some are saying it is a Gurkish curse.'\nJezal swallowed.

The magnificent city, the work of so many pairs of hands over\nlong centuries, it had taken only a few short weeks of his tender care to transform\ninto charred wreckage. Its proud people were mostly reduced to stinking beggars, to\nshrieking wounded, to wailing mourners. Those who had not been reduced to\ncorpses. He was the most pathetic excuse for a king the Union could ever have\nspawned. He could not bring happiness to his own bitter sham of a marriage, let\nalone a nation. His reputation was all based on lies that he had not the courage to\ndeny. He was a powerless, spineless, helpless cipher.\n'Whereabouts are we now?' he mumbled as they rode out into a great, windswept\nspace.\n'Why, this is the Four Corners, your Majesty.'\n'This? This cannot…' He trailed off, recognition coming as sharply as a slap in\nthe face.\nOnly two walls of the building that had once been the Mercers' guildhall still\nstood, windows and doorways gaping like the stricken features of corpses, frozen at\nthe moment of their deaths. The paving where hundreds of merry stalls had once\nbeen set out was cracked and caked with sticky soot. The gardens were leafless\npatches of mud and burned briar. The air should have been ringing with the calls of\ntraders, the prattle of servants, the laughter of children. Instead it was deadly silent\nbut for a cold wind hissing through the wreckage, sweeping waves of black grit\nthrough the heart of the city.\nJezal pulled on his reins, and his escort of some twenty Knights of the Body, five\nKnights Herald, a dozen of Varuz' staff and a nervous page or two clattered to a halt\naround him. Gorst frowned up towards the sky. 'Your Majesty, we should move on.\nIt is not safe here. We do not know when the Gurkish will begin their bombardment\nagain.'\nJezal ignored him, swung down from his saddle and walked out into the\nwreckage. It was difficult to believe that it was the same place where he had once\nbought wine, shopped for trinkets, been measured for a new uniform. Not one\nhundred strides away, on the other side of a row of smoking ruins, stood the statue\nof Harod the Great where he had met Ardee in the darkness, it seemed a hundred\nyears ago.\nA sorry group were clustered near there now, round the edge of a trampled\ngarden. Women and children, mostly, and a few old men. Dirty and despairing,\nseveral with crutches or bloody bandages, clutching salvaged oddments. Those\nrendered homeless in last night's fires, last night's fighting. Jezal's breath caught in his\nthroat. Ardee was one of them, sitting on a stone in a thin dress, shivering and\nstaring at the ground, her dark hair fallen across half of her face. He started towards\nher, the first time he had smiled in what felt like weeks.\n'Ardee.' She turned, eyes wide open, and Jezal froze. A different girl, younger\nand considerably less attractive. She blinked up at him, rocking slowly back and\nforward. His hands twitched ineffectually, he mumbled something incoherent. They"

They\nwere all watching him. He could hardly just walk off. 'Please, take this.' He fumbled\nwith the gilded clasps on his crimson cloak and held it out to her.\nShe said nothing as she took it from him, only stared. A ridiculous, worthless\ngesture, almost offensive in its burning hypocrisy. But the rest of the homeless\ncivilians did not seem to think so.\n'A cheer for King Jezal!' someone shouted, and a rousing clamour went up.\nA young lad on a crutch gazed at him with moon-eyed desperation. A soldier had\na bloody bandage over one eye, the other rimmed with proud moisture. A mother\nclutched a baby wrapped in what looked horribly like a shred of cloth from a fallen\nUnion flag. It was as if the whole scene had been carefully posed for the greatest\nemotional impact. A set of painter's models for a lurid and ham-fisted piece on the\nhorrors of war.\n'King Jezal!' came the shout again, accompanied by a weak, 'Hurrah!'\nTheir adulation was like poison to him. It only made the great weight of\nresponsibility press down all the heavier. He turned away, unable to maintain his\ntwisted mockery of a smile one instant longer.\n'What have I done?' he whispered, his hands tugging ceaselessly at each other.\n'What have I done?' He clambered back up into the saddle, guilt picking at his guts.\n'Take me closer to Arnault's Wall.'\n'Your Majesty, I hardly think that—'\n'You heard me! Closer to the fighting. I want to see it.'\nVaruz frowned. 'Very well.' He turned his horse, led Jezal and his bodyguard off\nin the direction of the Arches, down routes that were so familiar, and yet so horribly\nchanged. After a few nervous minutes the Lord Marshal pulled up his mount,\npointing down a deserted lane to the west. He spoke softly, as though worried the\nenemy might hear them.\n'Arnault's Wall is no more than three hundred strides that way, and the Gurkish\nare crawling on the other side. We really should turn—'\nJezal felt a faint vibration through his saddle, his horse started, dust filtered from\nthe roofs of the houses on one side of the street.\nHe was just opening his mouth to ask what had happened when the air was\nripped open by a thunderous noise. A crushing, terrifying wall of sound that left\nJezal's ears humming. Men gasped and gaped. The horses milled and kicked, their\neyes rolling with fear. Varuz' mount reared up, dumping the old soldier\nunceremoniously from his saddle.\nJezal paid him no mind, he was too busy urging his own horse keenly in the\ndirection of the blast, seized by an awful curiosity. Small stones had started raining\ndown, pinging from the roofs and clattering into the road like hailstones. A great\ncloud of brown dust was rising up into the sky to the west.\n'Your Majesty!' came Gorst's plaintive cry. 'We should turn back!'

But Jezal took\nno notice.\nHe rode out into a wide square, a great quantity of rubble scattered across the\nbroken paving, some of it in chunks big as sheds. As the choking dust slowly settled\nin an eerie silence, Jezal realised that he knew the place. Knew it well. There was a\ntavern he had used to visit on the north side, but something was changed—it was\nmore open than it had been… his jaw fell. A long stretch of Arnault's Wall had\nformed the western boundary of the square. Now there was nothing but a yawning\ncrater.\nThe Gurkish must have dug a mine and filled it with their damned blasting\npowder. The sun chose that moment to break through the clouds above and Jezal\ncould see all the way across the gaping fissure and into the ruined Arches district.\nThere, crowding at the far edge, clambering down the rubble strewn slope with\narmour glinting and spears waving, was a sizeable body of Gurkish soldiers.\nThe first of them were already climbing up out of the crater and into the remains\nof the shattered square. A few semi-conscious defenders were crawling through the\ndust, choking and spitting. Others were not moving at all. There was no one to turn\nthe Gurkish back, that Jezal could see. No one but him. He wondered what Harod\nthe Great would have done in this spot.\nThe answer was not so very hard to find.\nCourage can come from many places, and be made of many things, and\nyesterday's coward can become tomorrow's hero in an instant if the time is right.\nThe giddy flood of bravery which Jezal experienced at that moment consisted largely\nof guilt and fear, and shame at his fear, swollen by a peevish frustration at nothing\nhaving turned out the way he had hoped, and a sudden vague awareness that being\nkilled might solve a great number of irritating problems to which he saw no solution.\nNot noble ingredients, to be sure. But no one ever asks what the baker put in his pie\nas long as it tastes well.\nHe drew his sword and held it up to the sunlight. 'Knights of the Body!' he\nroared. 'With me!'\nGorst made a despairing grab at his reins. 'Your Majesty! You cannot put\nyourself in—'\nJezal gave his mount the spurs. It sprang forward with unexpected vigour, and his\nhead snapped painfully back almost causing him to lose his grip on the reins. He\nrolled in the saddle, hooves hammering, the dirty paving flying by beneath him. He\nwas dimly aware of his escort following, some distance behind, but his attention was\nrather drawn to the ever-increasing body of Gurkish soldiers directly ahead.\nHis horse carried him forwards with gut-churning speed, directly at a man at the\nvery front of the crowd, a standard-bearer with a tall staff, golden symbols shining\non it. His bad luck, Jezal supposed, to have been given such a prominent task. The\nman's eyes went wide as he saw an enormous weight of horse bearing down on him.\nHe flung away his standard and tried to throw himself aside.

More men went down screaming under the hooves of his mount\nas it crashed into their midst, he could not have said how many.\nThen all was chaos. He sat above a mass of snarling dark faces, glinting armour,\njabbing spears. Wood cracked, metal clanged, men shouted words he did not\nunderstand. He hacked around him, on one side then the other, yelling mindless\ncurses. A spear tip shrieked along his armoured leg. He chopped at a hand as it\nseized his reins and a couple of fingers flew off it. Something crunched into his side\nand nearly threw him from the saddle. His sword caved in a helmet with a hollow\nbonk and knocked the man under it down into the press of bodies.\nJezal's horse gave a shriek, reared up, twisting. He felt a terrible lurch of fear as\nhe came away from the saddle, the world turning over. He crunched down, dust in\nhis eyes, dust in his mouth, coughing and struggling. He rolled up to his knees.\nHooves crashed against the broken ground. Boots slid and stomped. He fumbled in\nhis hair for his circlet, but it must have come off somewhere. How would anyone\nknow he was king? Was he still king? His head was all sticky. A helmet would have\nbeen a damn good thing to have brought with him, but it was a little late now. He\nplucked weakly at the rubble, turned over a flat stone. He had forgotten what he was\nlooking for. He stumbled up, something caught his foot and snatched it painfully\naway, dumping him on his face again. He waited to have the back of his head\nbroken, but it was only his stirrup, still strapped to his horse's magnificent corpse.\nHe dragged his boot free, gasping for air, reeled a couple of drunken steps under the\nweight of his armour, his sword dangling from one limp hand.\nSomeone lifted a curved blade and Jezal stabbed him through the chest. He\nvomited blood in Jezal's face, fell and twisted the steel from his hand. Something\nthumped into Jezal's breastplate with a dull clang and knocked him sideways, right\ninto a Gurkish soldier with a spear. He dropped it and they clawed at each other,\ntottering pointlessly around. Jezal was getting terribly, terribly tired. His head hurt a\nlot. Just dragging the breath in was a tremendous effort. The whole heroic charge\nidea seemed as if it had been a bad one. He wanted to lie down.\nThe Gurkish soldier tore one arm free and raised it up high, a knife clutched in his\nfist. It flew off at the wrist, a long gout of blood spurting after it. He started to slide\nto the ground, staring at the stump and wailing. 'The king!' piped Gorst's boyish little\nvoice. 'The king!'\nHis long steel described a wide arc and whipped the screaming soldier's head\naway. Another leaped forward, a curved sword raised.

An axe clanged into his armoured shoulder and\nhe shrugged it away as if it was a fly, chopped the man who had swung it down in a\nshower of gore. A fourth got the short steel through his neck, staggered forward,\neyes bulging, one bloody hand clutched to his throat.\nJezal, swaying numbly back and forward, almost felt sorry for the Gurkish. Their\nnumbers might have been impressive from a distance, but close up these men were\nevidently auxiliaries, thrown forward into the crater as a forlorn hope. They were\nscrawny, dirty, helplessly disorganised, lightly armed and barely armoured. Many of\nthem, he realised, looked extremely scared. Gorst hacked his way impassively\nthrough them like a bull through a flock of sheep, growling as his scything steels\nopened gaping wounds with sickening fleshy sounds. Other armoured figures\ncrowded in after him, shoving with shields, chopping with their bright swords,\nclearing a bloody space in the Gurkish crowd.\nGorst's hand slid under Jezal's armpit and dragged him backwards, his heels\nkicking at the rubble. He was vaguely aware that he had dropped his sword\nsomewhere, but it seemed foolish to go looking for it now. Some beggar would no\ndoubt receive a priceless windfall while he hunted among the bodies, later. Jezal saw\na Knight Herald still mounted, an outline with a winged helmet in the choking dust,\nhis long axe chopping around him.\nHe was half-carried back, out of the press. Some of the city's regular defenders\nhad regrouped, or were coming in from other parts of the walls. Men with steel caps\nstarted to kneel at the lip of the crater, shooting flatbows down into the heaving mass\nof Gurkish in the bottom, all tangled up with the mud and the rubble. Others dragged\nup a cart and tipped it onto its side to form a temporary rampart. A Gurkish soldier\nsobbed as he was cut open, tumbled over the ragged edge of the crater and back\ndown into the mud. More Union flatbows appeared at the edge of the square, more\nspears. Barrels, masonry, broken spars came with them until an improvised\nbarricade was built up all across the wide gap in Arnault's wall, bristling with men\nand weapons.\nPeppered with bolts and chunks of fallen masonry, the Gurkish faltered, then fell\nback, scrambling through the debris to their side of the crater and up towards safety,\nleaving the bottom strewn with corpses.\n'To the Agriont, your Majesty,' said Gorst. 'At once.'\nJezal made no effort to resist. He had done more than enough fighting for today.\nSomething strange was happening in the Square of Marshals. Labourers were\nworking at the paving stones with pick and chisel, digging up shallow trenches,\napparently at random. Smiths sweated at temporary forges, pouring iron into\nmoulds, lit by the glow of molten metal.

The din of clanging hammers and crashing\nstone was enough to make Jezal's teeth hurt, yet somehow the voice of the First of\nthe Magi managed to be louder still.\n'No! A circle, dunce, from here to there!'\n'I must return to the Halls Martial, your Majesty,' said Varuz. 'Arnault's Wall is\nbreached. It will not be long until the Gurkish try to push through once again. They\nwould already be at the Middleway if it hadn't been for that charge of yours, though,\neh? I see now how you won your reputation in the west! As noble a business as I\never saw!'\n'Uh.' Jezal watched the dead being dragged away. Three Knights of the Body,\none of Varuz' staff and a page-boy no older than twelve, the last with his head\nhanging off by a flap of gristle. Three men and a child he had led to their deaths.\nAnd that was without even considering the wounds the rest of his faithful entourage\nhad gathered on his behalf. A noble business indeed.\n'Wait here,' he snapped at Gorst, then he threaded his way through the sweating\nworkmen towards the First of the Magi. Ferro sat cross-legged nearby on a row of\nbarrels, her hands dangling loose, the same utter contempt she had always shown\nhim written plainly on her dark face. It was almost comforting to see that some\nthings never changed. Bayaz was glaring grimly down into the pages of a large black\nbook, evidently of great age, its leather covers cracked and torn. He looked gaunt\nand pale, old and withered. One side of his face was covered in scabbed-over\nscratches.\n'What happened to you?' asked Jezal.\nBayaz frowned, a muscle trembling under one dark-ringed eye. 'I could ask you\nthe same question.'\nJezal noted that the Magus had not even bothered with a 'your Majesty'. He\ntouched a hand to the bloody bandage round his skull. 'I was involved in a charge.'\n'In a what?'\n'The Gurkish brought down a section of Arnault's Wall while I was surveying the\ncity. There was no one to turn them back, and so… I did it myself.' He was almost\nsurprised to hear himself saying the words. He was far from proud of the fact,\ncertainly. He had done little more than ride, fall, and hit his head. Bremer dan Gorst\nand his own dead horse had done the majority of the fighting, and against meagre\nopposition to boot. But he supposed he had done the right thing, for once, if there\nwas any such a thing.\nBayaz did not agree. 'Have what little brains fate saved for you turned to shit?'\n'Have they…' Jezal blinked as the meaning of Bayaz' words soaked slowly into\nhis consciousness. 'How dare you, you meddling old turd? You are talking to a\nking!' That was what he wanted to say, but his head was pounding, and something in\nthe Magus' twitching, wasted face prevented him. Instead he found himself\nmumbling in a tone almost apologetic. 'But… I don't understand. I thought… isn't\nthat what Harod the Great would have done?'"

'Harod was an utter coward, and an utter\nfathead to boot! That idiot could scarcely dress himself without my help!'\n'But—'\n'It is easy to find men to lead charges.' The Magus pronounced each word with\nexaggerated care, as though addressing a simpleton. 'Finding men to lead nations is\nconsiderably more difficult. I do not intend that the effort I have put into you should\nbe wasted. Next time you experience a yearning to risk your life, perhaps you might\nlock yourself in the latrine instead. People respect a man with a fighter's reputation,\nand that you have been fortunate enough to have been gifted. People do not respect\na corpse. Not there!' roared Bayaz, limping past Jezal and waving one arm angrily at\none of the smiths. The poor man started like a frightened rabbit, glowing embers\nspattering from his crucible. 'I told you, fool! You must follow the charts precisely!\nExactly as I have drawn it! One mistake could be worse than fatal!'\nJezal stared after him, outrage, guilt, and simple exhaustion fighting for control of\nhis body. Exhaustion won. He trudged over to the barrels and slumped down next to\nFerro.\n'Your fucking Majesty,' she said.\nHe rubbed at his eyes with finger and thumb. 'You do me too much honour with\nyour kind attentions.'\n'Bayaz not happy, eh?'\n'It seems not.'\n'Well. When is that old bastard happy with anything?'\nJezal gave a grunt of agreement. He realised that he had not spoken to Ferro since\nhe was crowned. It was not as though they had been fast friends before, of course,\nbut he had to admit that he was finding her utter lack of deference to him an\nunexpected tonic. It was almost like being, for a brief moment, the vain, idle,\nworthless, happy man he used to be. He frowned over at Bayaz, stabbing his finger\nat something in his old book. 'What ever is he up to, anyway?'\n'Saving the world, he tells me.'\n'Ah. That. He's left it a little late, don't you think?\nShe shrugged. 'I'm not in charge of the timing.'\n'How does he plan to do it? With picks and forges?'\nFerro watched him. He still found those devil-yellow eyes as off-putting as ever.\n'Among other things.'\nJezal planted his elbows on his knees, his chin drooping down onto his palms,\nand gave vent to a long sigh. He was so very, very tired. 'I seem to have done the\nwrong thing,' he muttered.\n'Huh.' Ferro's eyes slid away. 'You've got a knack for it.'\nNightfall\n« ^ »\nGeneral Poulder squirmed in his field chair, moustaches quivering, as though he\ncould only just control his body so overpowering was his fury.

General Kroy sat rigidly erect\non the opposite side of the table, clenched jaw-muscles bulging from the side of his\nclose-cropped skull. His murderous frown clearly demonstrated that his anger at the\ninvader, while no less than anyone else's, was kept under iron command, and if any\ncharging was to be done it would be managed with fastidious attention to detail.\nIn their first briefings West had found himself outnumbered twenty to one by the\ntwo Generals' monstrous staffs. He had reduced them, by a relentless process of\nattrition, to a meagre two officers a piece. The meetings had lost the charged\natmosphere of a tavern brawl and instead taken on the character of a small and\nbad-tempered family event—perhaps the reading of a disputed will. West was the\nexecutor, trying to find an acceptable solution for two squabbling beneficiaries to\nwhom nothing was acceptable. Jalenhorm and Brint, sitting to either side of him,\nwere his dumbstruck assistants. What role the Dogman played in the metaphor it was\nhard to judge, but he was adding to the already feverish pitch of worry in the tent by\npicking at his fingernails with a dagger.\n'This will be a battle like no other!' Poulder was frothing, pointlessly. 'Never since\nHarod forged the Union has an invader set foot upon the soil of Midderland!'\nKroy growled his agreement.\n'The Gurkish mean to overturn our laws, smother our culture, make slaves of our\npeople! The very future of our nation hangs in the—'\nThe tent flap snapped back and Pike ducked through, his melted face\nexpressionless. A tall man shuffled behind, stooped over and wobbly with fatigue, a\nheavy blanket wrapped round his shoulders, his face smeared with dirt.\n'This is Fedor dan Hayden,' said Pike. 'A Knight Herald. He was able to swim\nfrom the docks in Adua under cover of night, and slip around the Gurkish lines.'\n'An action of conspicuous bravery,' said West, to grumbles of grudging\nagreement from Poulder and Kroy. 'You have all of our thanks. How do things stand\ninside the city?'\n'Frankly, my Lord Marshal, they are dire.' Hayden's voice was scratchy with\nweariness. 'The western districts—the Arches and the Three Farms—belong to the\nEmperor. The Gurkish breached Arnault's Wall two days ago, and the defences are\nstretched to breaking point. At any moment they could burst through, and threaten\nthe Agriont itself. His Majesty asks that you march on Adua with all possible speed.\nEvery hour could be vital.'\n'Does he have any particular strategy in mind?' asked West. Jezal dan Luthar\nnever used to have anything in mind beyond getting drunk and bedding his sister, but\nhe hoped that time might have wrought changes.\n'The Gurkish have the city surrounded, but they are spread thin. On the eastern\nside, particularly. Lord Marshal Varuz believes you could break through with a sharp\nattack.'\n'Though the western districts of the city will still be crawling with Gurkish swine,'\ngrowled Kroy."

'Bastards.'\n'We have no choice but to march on Adua immediately,' said West. 'We will\nmake use of every road and move with all possible speed to take up a position east\nof the city, marching by torchlight if necessary. We must assault the Gurkish\nencirclement at dawn and break their hold on the walls. Admiral Reutzer will\nmeanwhile lead the fleet in an attack against the Gurkish ships in the harbour. General\nKroy, order some cavalry forward to scout the way and screen our advance. I want\nno surprises.'\nFor once, there was no sign of reluctance. 'Of course, my Lord Marshal.'\n'Your division will approach Adua from the north-east, break through the Gurkish\nlines and enter the city in force, pushing westward towards the Agriont. If the enemy\nhave reached the centre of the city, you will engage them. If not, you will bolster the\ndefences at Arnault's Wall and prepare to flush them from the Arches district.'\nKroy nodded grimly, a single vein bulging on his forehead, his officers like\nstatues of military precision behind him. 'By this time tomorrow, not one Kantic\nsoldier will be left alive in Adua.'\n'Dogman, I would like you and your Northmen to support General Kroy's\ndivision in their attack. If your…' West wrestled with the word, '… king has no\nobjections.'\nThe Dogman licked his sharp teeth. 'Reckon he'll go whichever way the wind\nblows. That's always been his style.'\n'The wind blows towards Adua tonight.'\n'Aye.' The Northman nodded. 'Towards Adua, then.'\n'General Poulder, your division will approach the city from the south-east,\nparticipate in the battle for the walls, then enter the city in force and move on the\ndocks. If the enemy has made it that far, you will clear them away, then turn\nnorthwards and follow the Middleway to the Agriont.'\nPoulder hammered the table with his fist, his officers growling like prize-fighters.\n'Yes, damn it! We'll paint the streets with Gurkish blood!'\nWest gave Poulder, and then Kroy, each a hard frown. 'I hardly need to\nemphasise the importance of victory tomorrow.'\nThe two Generals rose without a word and moved for the tent flap together. They\nfaced each other before it. For a moment West wondered if, even now, they would\nfall back into their familiar bickering.\nThen Kroy held out his hand. 'The best of luck, General Poulder.'\nPoulder seized the hand in both of his. 'And to you, General Kroy. The very best\nof luck to all of us.' The two of them stepped smartly out into the dusk, their officers\nfollowing, Jalenhorm and Brint close behind.\nHayden coughed.

Have any of the others arrived?'\n'No… not yet. Perhaps later…' West did not think it terribly likely, and neither\ndid Hayden, he could see it in his eyes.\n'Of course. Perhaps later.'\n'Sergeant Pike will find you some wine and a horse. I imagine you would very\nmuch like to see us attack the Gurkish in the morning.'\n'I would.'\n'Very good.' The two men left the way they had come, and West frowned after\nthem. A shame about the man's comrades, but there would be many more deaths to\nmourn before tomorrow was done. If there was anyone left to do the mourning. He\npushed aside the tent flap and stepped out into the chill air.\nThe ships of the fleet were anchored in the narrow harbour down below, rocking\nslowly on the waves, tall masts waving back and forth against the darkening\nclouds—hard blue, and cold grey, and angry orange. West fancied he could see a\nfew boats crawling closer to the black beach, still ferrying the last of the army to the\nshore.\nThe sun was dropping fast towards the horizon, a final muddy flare above the\nhills in the west. Somewhere under there, just out of sight, Adua was burning. West\nworked his shoulders round in circles, trying to force the knotted muscles to relax.\nHe had heard no word since before they left Angland. As far as he was aware Ardee\nwas still inside its walls. But there was nothing he could do. Nothing beyond\nordering an immediate attack and hoping, against the general run of luck, for the\nbest. He rubbed unhappily at his stomach. He had been suffering with indigestion\never since the sea journey. The pressures of command, no doubt. A few more\nweeks of it would probably see him vomiting blood over his maps, just like his\npredecessor. He took a long, ragged breath and blew it out.\n'I know how you feel.' It was the Dogman, sitting on a rickety bench beside the\ntent flap, elbows on his knees, staring down towards the sea.\nWest sagged down beside him. Briefings with Poulder and Kroy were always a\nterrible drain. Play the man of stone for too long and you are left a man of straw. 'I'm\nsorry,' he found himself saying.\nDogman looked up at him. 'You are? For what?'\n'For all of it. For Threetrees, for Tul… for Cathil.' West had to swallow an\nunexpected lump in his throat. 'For all of it. I'm sorry.'\n'Ah, we're all sorry. I don't blame you. I don't blame no one, not even Bethod.\nWhat good does blame do? We all do what we have to. I gave up looking for\nreasons a long time ago.'\nWest thought about that for a moment. Then he nodded. 'Alright.' They sat and\nwatched the torches being lit around the bay below, like glittering dust spreading out\nacross the dark country.\nNight time, and a grim one.

Grim most of all for what\nwaited at the end of it, when the sun came up. Marching to a battle only got harder\neach time. When Logen had been a young man, before he lost a finger and gained a\nblack reputation, there'd at least been some trace of excitement to it, some shadow\nof a thrill. Now there was only the sick fear. Fear of the fight, and worse still, fear of\nthe results.\nBeing king was no kind of help. It was no help to anything, far as he could see. It\nwas just like being chief, but worse. Made him think there was something he should\nbe doing that he wasn't. Made the gap between him and everyone else that bit wider.\nThat bit more unbridgeable.\nBoots squelched and sucked, weapons and harness clattered and jingled, men\ngrunted and cursed in the darkness. A few of them had spitting torches now, to light\nthe muddy way, streaks of rain flitting down in the glow around them. The rain fell\non Logen too, a feathery kiss at his scalp, and his face, the odd pit and patter on the\nshoulders of his old coat.\nThe Union army was spread out down five roads, all heading east, all pointing\ntowards Adua and what sounded like a hard reckoning with the Gurkish. Logen and\nhis crew were on the northernmost one. Off to the south he could see a faint line of\nflickering lights, floating disembodied in the black country, stretching away out of\nsight. Another column. Another few thousand men, cursing through the mud\ntowards a bloody dawn.\nLogen frowned. He saw the side of Shivers' lean face, up ahead, by the flickering\nlight of a torch, a scowl full of hard shadows, one eye glinting. They watched each\nother for a moment, then Shivers turned his back, hunched up his shoulders and\ncarried on walking.\n'He still don't like me much, that one, and never will.'\n'Careless slaughter ain't necessarily the high road to popularity,' said Dogman.\n'Especially in a king.'\n'But that one there might have the bones to do something about it.' Shivers had a\ngrudge. One that wasn't going away with time, or kindness, or even lives saved.\nThere aren't many wounds that ever heal all the way, and there are some that hurt\nmore with every day that passes.\nThe Dogman seemed to guess at Logen's thoughts. 'Don't worry about Shivers.\nHe's alright. We've got plenty to worry about with these Gurkish, or whatever.'\n'Uh,' said Grim.\nLogen wasn't so sure about that. The worst enemies are the ones that live next\ndoor, his father always used to tell him. Back in the old days he'd just have murdered\nthe bastard where he stood and problem solved. But he was trying to be a better\nman now. He was trying hard.\n'By the dead, though,' Dogman was saying. 'Fighting against brown men, now,\nfor the Union? How the bloody hell did that all happen? We shouldn't be down here.'"

It's\njust this one last fight.'\n'You ever noticed how one fight has a habit of leading on to another? Seems like\nthere's always one fight more.'\n'Uh,' said Grim.\n'Not this time. This is the last, then we're done.'\n'That so? And what happens then?'\n'Back to the North, I guess.' Logen shrugged his shoulders. 'Peace, isn't it?'\n'Peace?' grunted the Dogman. 'Just what is that, anyway? What do you do with\nit?'\n'I reckon… well… we'll make things grow, or something.'\n'Make things grow? By all the fucking dead! What do you, or I, or any one of us\nknow about making things grow? What else have we done, all our lives, but kill?'\nLogen wriggled his shoulders, uncomfortable. 'Got to keep some hope. A man\ncan learn, can't he?'\n'Can he? The more you kill, the better you get at it. And the better you get at\nkilling, the less use you are for anything else. Seems to me we've lived this long\n'cause when it comes to killing we're the very best there is.'\n'You're in a black mood, Dogman.'\n'I been in a black mood for years. What worries me is that you ain't. Hope don't\nmuch suit the likes of us, Logen. Answer me this. You ever touched a thing that\nwasn't hurt by it? What have you ever had, that didn't turn to dirt?'\nLogen thought about that. His wife and his children, his father and his people, all\nback to the mud. Forley, Threetrees and Tul. All good folk, and all dead, some of\nthem by Logen's own hand, some of them by his neglect, and his pride, and his\nfoolishness. He could see their faces, now, in his thoughts, and they didn't look\nhappy. The dead don't often. And that was without looking to the dark and sullen\ncrew lurking behind. A crowd of ghosts. A hacked and bloody army. All the folk\nhe'd chosen to kill. Shama Heartless, his guts hanging out of his split stomach.\nBlacktoe, with his crushed legs and his burned hands. That Finnius bastard, one foot\ncut off and his chest slashed open. Bethod, even, right at the front with his skull\npounded to mush, his frowning face twisted sideways, Crummock's dead boy\npeering from around his elbow. A sea of murder. Logen squeezed his eyes shut then\nprised them wide open, but the faces still lingered at the edge of his mind. There was\nnothing he could say.\n'Thought so.'

He strode\noff up the road, under the cold stars. Grim lingered next to Logen for a moment,\nthen he shrugged his damp shoulders and followed the Dogman, taking his torch\nwith him.\n'A man can change,' whispered Logen, not sure whether he was talking to the\nDogman, or to himself, or to those corpse-pale faces waiting in the darkness. Men\nclattered down the track all round him, and yet he stood alone. 'A man can change.'\nQuestions\n« ^ »\nA trace of autumn fog had slunk off the restless sea as the sun went down over\ncrippled Adua, turning the chill night ghostly. A hundred strides distant the houses\nwere indistinct. Two hundred and they were spectral, the few lights in the windows\nfloating wraiths, hazy through the gloom. Good weather for bad work, and we have\nmuch of that ahead of us.\nNo distant explosions had rattled the still darkness so far. The Gurkish catapults\nhad fallen silent. At least for the moment, and why not? The city almost belongs to\nthem, and why burn your own city? Here, on the eastern side of Adua, far from the\nfighting, all seemed timelessly calm. Almost as if the Gurkish had never come. So\nwhen a vague clattering filtered through the gloom, as of the boots of a body of\nwell-armed men, Glokta could not help a pang of nervousness, and pressed himself\ninto the deeper shadows against the hedge by the road. Faint, bobbing lights filtered\nthrough the murk. Then the outline of a man, one hand resting casually on the\npommel of a sword, walking with a loose, strutting slouch that bespoke extreme\nover-confidence. Something tall appeared to stick from his head, waving with his\nmovements.\nGlokta peered into the murk. 'Cosca?'\n'The very same!' laughed the Styrian. He was affecting a fine leather cap with a\nludicrously tall plume, and he flicked at it with a finger. 'I bought a new hat. Or\nshould I say you bought me one, eh, Superior?'\n'So I see.' Glokta glared at the long feather, the flamboyant golden basketwork on\nthe hilt of Cosca's sword. 'I thought we said inconspicuous.'\n'In… con… spicuous?' The Styrian frowned, then shrugged his shoulders. 'Ah,\nso that was the word. I remember something was said, and I remember I didn't\nunderstand it.' He winced, and scratched at his crotch with one hand. 'I think I\npicked up some passengers from one of those women at the tavern. Little bastards\ndon't half give a man an itch.' Huh. The women are paid to go there. One might\nhave thought the lice would have better taste.\nA shadowy crowd began to form out of the darkness behind Cosca, a few\ncarrying hooded lanterns. A dozen shaggy outlines, then a dozen more, menace\nfloating silently from each one of them like the stink floating from a turd. 'Are these\nyour men?'"

A man almost dwarfish, with a face like a rat and\nonly one eye accompanied him. He had not bothered with a patch, and the socket\nyawned open under his greasy hair. The list of villainy went on.

His warm breath smelled\nstrongly of spirits and corruption. 'Every man not desperate fled the city the moment\nthe Gurkish arrived. But who cares, eh? I hired them for their guts and their sinews,\nnot their looks. Desperate men are the kind I like! We can understand them, no, you\nand I? Some jobs call for desperate men only, eh, Superior?'\nGlokta frowned briefly over that collection of gaunt, of bloated, of scarred and\nruined faces. How could it possibly be that promising Colonel Glokta, dashing\ncommander of the King's Own first regiment, came to be in charge of such a\nrabble? He gave a long sigh. But it is a little late now to be finding fine-looking\nmercenaries, and I suppose these will fill a pit as well as better. 'Very well. Wait\nhere.'\nGlokta looked up at the dark house as he swung the gate open with his free hand\nand hobbled through. A chink of light peeped out from between the heavy hangings\nin the front window. He rapped at the door with the handle of his cane. A pause,\nthen the sound of reluctant footsteps shuffling up the hall.\n'Who is it?'\n'Me. Glokta.'\nBolts drew back and light spilled out into the chill. Ardee's face appeared,\nlean-looking, grey round the eyes and pink round the nose. Like a dying cat.\n'Superior!' She grinned as she took him by the elbow and half-dragged him over\nthe threshold. 'What a delight! Some conversation at last! I'm so toweringly bored.'\nSeveral empty bottles were gathered in the corner of the living room, made to glint\nangrily by smoky candles and a smouldering log in the grate. The table was cluttered"

The table was cluttered\nwith dirty plates and glasses. The place smelled of sweat and wine, old food and\nnew desperation. Can there be a more miserable occupation than getting drunk on\none's own? Wine can keep a happy man happy, on occasion. A sad one it always\nmakes worse.\n'I've been trying to get through this damn book again.' Ardee slapped at a heavy\nvolume lying open, face down, on a chair.\n'The Fall of the Master Maker,' muttered Glokta. 'That rubbish? All magic and\nvalour, no? I couldn't get through the first one.'\n'I sympathise. I'm onto the third and it doesn't get any easier. Too many damn\nwizards. I get them mixed up one with another. It's all battles and endless bloody\njourneys, here to there and back again. If I so much as glimpse another map I swear\nI'll kill myself.'\n'Someone might save you the trouble.'\n'Eh?'\n'I'm afraid you are no longer safe here. You should come with me.'\n'Rescue? Thank the fates!' She waved a dismissive hand. 'We've been over this.\nThe Gurkish are away on the other side of the city. You're in more danger in the\nAgriont I shouldn't—'\n'The Gurkish are not the threat. My suitors are.'\n'Your gentleman-friends are a threat to me?'\n'You underestimate the extent of their jealousy. I fear they will soon become a\nthreat to everyone I have known, friend or enemy, my whole sorry life.' Glokta\njerked a hooded cloak from a peg on the wall and held it out to her.\n'Where are we going?'\n'A charming little house down near the docks. A little past its best, but plenty of\ncharacter. Like the two of us, you could say.'\nThere were heavy footsteps in the hallway and Cosca stuck his head into the\nroom. 'Superior, we should leave if we want to reach the docks by—' He stopped,\nstaring at Ardee. There was an uncomfortable silence.\n'Who is this?' she murmured.\nCosca pushed flamboyantly into the room, swept off his hat, displaying his\nscabrous bald patch, and bowed low, low, low. Any lower and his nose would\nscrape the floorboards. 'Forgive me, my lady. Nicomo Cosca, famed soldier of\nfortune, at your service. Abject, in fact, at your feet.' His throwing knife dropped out\nof his coat and rattled against the boards.\nThey all stared at it for a moment, then Cosca grinned up. 'You see that fly,\nagainst the wall?'\nGlokta narrowed his eyes. 'Perhaps not the best moment for—'\nThe blade spun across the room, missed the target by a stride, hit the wall\nhandle-first and gouged out a lump of plaster, bounced back and clattered across the\nfloor.\n'Shit,' said Cosca.

When the Superior\ndescribed to me your beauty I thought he must have… how do you say…\nexaggerated? Now I see that he came short of the mark.' He retrieved his knife and\njammed his hat back on, slightly askew. 'Please allow me to declare myself in love.'\n'What did you tell him?' asked Ardee.\n'Nothing.' Glokta sucked sourly at his gums. 'Master Cosca has a habit of\noverstating the case.'\n'Especially when in love,' threw in the mercenary. 'Especially then. When I fall in\nlove, I fall hard, and, as a rule, I do it no more than once a day.'\nArdee stared at him. 'I don't know whether to feel flattered or scared.'\n'Why not be both?' said Glokta. 'But you will have to do it on the way.' We are\nshort of time, and I have a rank garden to weed.\nThe gate came open with an agonised shrieking of rusted metal. Glokta lurched over\nthe decaying threshold, his leg, his hip, his back all stabbing at him from the long\nlimp to the docks. The ruined mansion loomed out of the gloom at the far end of the\nshattered courtyard. Like a mighty mausoleum. A suitable tomb for all my dead\nhopes. Severard and Frost waited in the shadows on the broken steps, dressed all in\nblack and masked, as usual. But not at all alike. A burly man and a slender, one\nwhite haired and one dark, one standing, arms folded, the other sitting, cross-legged.\nOne is loyal, the other… we shall find out.\nSeverard unravelled himself and got up with the usual grin around his eyes.\n'Alright, chief, so what's all the—'\nCosca stepped through the gate and wandered lazily across the broken paving,\ntapping a few lumps of masonry away with the toe of one shabby boot. He stopped\nbeside a ruined fountain and scraped some muck out of it with a finger. 'Nice place.\nNice and…' He waved the finger around, and the muck with it. 'Crumbly.' His\nmercenaries were already spreading out slowly around the rubble-strewn courtyard.\nPatched coats and tattered cloaks twitched back to display weapons of every size\nand shape. Edges, points, spikes and flanges glinted in the shifting light from their\nlanterns, their steel as smooth and clean as their faces were rough and dirty.\n'Who the hell are these?' asked Severard.\n'Friends.'\n'They don't look too friendly.'\nGlokta showed his Practical the yawning hole in his front teeth. 'Well. I suppose\nthat all depends whose side you're on.'\nThe last traces of Severard's smile had vanished. His eyes flickered nervously\naround the yard. The eyes of the guilty.

One might have\nhoped for better from a man of his experience, but holding the blade is a poor\npreparation for being cut by it. I should know. Severard dashed towards the house,\nquick as a rabbit, but he only got a step before a heavy white hand chopped into the\nside of his neck and flung him senseless on the broken paving.\n'Take him downstairs, Frost. You know the way.'\n'Downthairth. Unh.' The hulking albino dragged Severard's limp body over his\nshoulder and set off towards the front door.\n'I have to say,' said Cosca, flicking the scum carelessly off his finger, 'that I like\nyour way with your men, Superior. Discipline, I've always admired it.'\n'Fine advice from the least disciplined man in the Circle of the World.'\n'I have learned all kinds of things from my many mistakes.' Cosca stretched his\nchin up and scratched at his scabby neck. 'The one thing I never learn is to stop\nmaking them.'\n'Huh,' grunted Glokta as he laboured up the steps. A curse we all have to bear.\nRound and round in circles we go, clutching at successes that we never grasp,\nendlessly tripping over the same old failures. Truly, life is the misery we endure\nbetween disappointments.\nThey stepped through the empty doorway and into the deeper darkness of the\nentrance hall. Cosca held his lamp high, staring up towards the ragged roof, his\nboots squelching heedless in the bird droppings spattering the floor. 'A palace!' His\nvoice echoed back from the shattered staircases, the empty doorways, the naked\nrafters high above.\n'Please make yourselves comfortable,' said Glokta. 'But out of sight, perhaps.\nWe can expect visitors some time tonight.'\n'Excellent. We love company, don't we lads?'\nOne of Cosca's men gave a wet-lunged chuckle, displaying two rows of\nshit-coloured teeth. A set so incredibly rotten I am almost glad to have my own.\n'These visitors will come from his Eminence the Arch Lector. Perhaps you could\ntake a firm hand with them, while I'm downstairs?'\nCosca glanced round approvingly at the crumbling hall. 'A nice place for a warm\nwelcome. I'll let you know when our guests have been. I doubt they'll stay long.'\nArdee had found a place near the wall, her hood up, her eyes on the floor. Trying\nto fade into the plaster, and who could blame her? Hardly the most pleasant\ncompany for a young woman, or the most reassuring setting. But better than a slit\nthroat, I suppose. Glokta held his hand out to her. 'It would be best if you were to\ncome with me.'\nShe hesitated. As though not entirely sure that it would, in fact, be best to come\nwith me. But a brief glance at some of the ugliest men in one of the world's ugliest\nprofessions evidently persuaded her. Cosca handed her his lamp, making sure his\nfingers lingered on hers for an uncomfortably long moment.\n'Thank you,' she said, jerking her hand away.\n'My particular pleasure.'\nSheets of hanging paper, broken laths, lumps of fallen plaster cast strange"

Doorways passed by, squares of blackness, yawning like\ngraves.\n'Your friends seem a charming crowd,' murmured Ardee.\n'Oh indeed, the brightest stars in the social firmament. Some tasks demand\ndesperate men, apparently.'\n'You must have some truly desperate work in mind, then.'\n'When don't I?'\nTheir lamp barely lit the rotting drawing room, panelling sagging from the cheap\nbrickwork, the best part of the floor a single festering puddle. The hidden door\nstood open in the far wall and Glokta shuffled round the edge of the room towards\nit, his hips burning with the effort.\n'What did your man do?'\n'Severard? He let me down.' And we will soon find out how badly.\n'I hope I never let you down, then.'\n'You, I am sure, have better sense. I should go first, then if I fall at least I fall\nalone.' He winced his way down the steps while she followed with the light.\n'Ugh. What's that smell?'\n'The sewers. There's an entrance to them down here, somewhere.' Glokta\nstepped past the heavy door and into the converted wine cellar, the bright steel grilles\non the cells to either side glimmering as they passed, the whole place reeking of\ndamp and fear.\n'Superior!' came a voice from the darkness. Brother Longfoot's desperate face\nappeared, pressed up against one set of bars.\n'Brother Longfoot, my apologies! I have been so very busy. The Gurkish have\nlaid siege to the city.'\n'Gurkish?' squeaked the man, his eyes bulging. 'Please, if you release me—'\n'Silence!' hissed Glokta in a voice that brooked no dallying. 'You should stay\nhere.'\nArdee glanced nervously towards the Navigator's cell. 'Here?'\n'He isn't dangerous. I think you'll be more comfortable than you would be…' and\nhe nodded his head towards the open doorway at the end of the vaulted hall, 'in\nthere.'\nShe swallowed. 'Alright.'\n'Superior, please!' One despairing arm stuck from Longfoot's cell, 'please, when\nwill you release me? Superior, please!' Glokta shut the door on his begging with a\ngentle click. We have other business today, and it will not wait.\nFrost already had Severard manacled to the chair beside the table, still\nunconscious, and was lighting the lamps one by one with a flaming taper. The\ndomed chamber gradually grew bright, the colour leaking into the mural across the\nround walls. Kanedias frowned down, arms outstretched, the fire burning behind\nhim. Ah, our old friend the Master Maker, always disapproving. Opposite him his\nbrother Juvens still bled his lurid last across the wall.

Severard grunted again, his head dropped\nback, eyelids flickering. Frost lumbered over, reached out and undid the buckles on\nSeverard's mask, pulled it off and tossed it away into the corner of the room. From\na fearsome Practical of the Inquisition to… nothing much. He stirred, wrinkled his\nnose, twitching like a boy asleep.\nYoung. Weak. Helpless. One could almost feel sorry for him, if one had a heart.\nBut now is not the time for sentiment and soft feelings, for friendship and\nforgiveness. The ghost of happy and promising Colonel Sand dan Glokta has been\nclinging to me for far too long. Farewell, my old friend. You cannot help us today.\nNow is the time for the ruthless Superior Glokta to do what he does best. To do the\nonly thing that he does well. Now is the time for hard heads, hard hearts and even\nharder edges.\nTime to cut the truth out.\nFrost jabbed Severard in the stomach with two fingers and his eyes snapped\nopen. He jerked in his chair, the manacles rattling. He saw Glokta. He saw Frost. His\neyes went wide as they darted round the room. They went wider still when he\nrealised where he was. He snorted in air, the quick, hard breath of abject terror, the\ngreasy strands of hair across his face blowing this way and that with the force of it.\nAnd how will we begin?\n'I know…' he croaked. 'I know I told that woman who you were… I know… but\nI had no choice.' Ah, the wheedling. Every man, more or less, behaves the same\nway when he's chained to a chair. 'What could I do? She would've fucking killed\nme! I had no choice! Please—'\n'I know what you told her, and I know you had no choice.'\n'Then… then why—'\n'Don't give me that, Severard. You know why you're here.' Frost stepped\nforward, as impassive as ever, and lifted the lid on Glokta's wonderful case. The\ntrays inside opened up like an exotic flower, proffering out the polished handles, the\ngleaming needles, the shining blades of his instruments.\nGlokta puffed out his cheeks. 'I had a good day, today. I woke up clean, and\nmade it to the bath on my own. Not too much pain.' He wrapped his fingers around\nthe grip of the cleaver. 'Something to celebrate, a good day. I get so very few of\nthem.' He slid it from its sheath, the heavy blade flashing in the harsh lamplight.\nSeverard's eyes followed it all the way, bulging with fear and fascination, beads of\nsweat glittering on his pale forehead.\n'No,' he whispered. Yes. Frost unlocked the cuff around Severard's left wrist,\nlifted his arm in both meaty hands. He took the fingers and spread them out one by\none until they were flattened on the wood in front of him, wrapping his other arm\naround Severard's shoulders in a tight embrace."

Glokta rocked forward, got up and\nlimped slowly around the table, his cane clicking on the tiles, his left leg dragging\nbehind it, the corner of the cleaver's blade scraping gently across the wood of the\ntable-top. 'I need not explain how this will work to you. You, who have assisted me\nso very ably, on so very many occasions. Who could know better how we will\nproceed?'\n'No,' whimpered Severard, trying half a desperate smile, but with a tear leaking\nfrom the corner of his eye nonetheless. 'No, you wouldn't! Not to me! You\nwouldn't!'\n'Not to you?' Glokta gave a sad smile of his own. 'Oh, Practical Severard,\nplease…' He let the grin slowly fade as he lifted the cleaver. 'You know me so much\nbetter than that.'\nBang! The heavy blade flashed down and hacked into the table-top, paring the\nslightest sliver of skin from the end of Severard's middle finger.\n'No!' he squawked. 'No!' You don't admire my precision any longer, then?\n'Oh, yes, yes.' Glokta tugged at the smooth handle and dragged the blade free.\n'How did you think this would end? You've been talking. You've been saying things\nyou shouldn't, to people you had no business saying anything to. You will tell me\nwhat. You will tell me who.' The cleaver glimmered as he raised it again. 'And you\nhad better tell me soon.'\n'No!' Severard thrashed and wriggled in the chair but Frost had him as tightly as a\nfly in honey. Yes.\nThe blade sliced cleanly through the end of Severard's middle finger and took it\noff at the first joint. The end of his index finger spun across the wood. The tip of his\nring finger stayed where it was, wedged into a joint in the table top. With Frost's\nhand still clamped tight as a vice round his wrist the blood only dribbled gently from\nthe three wounds and spread out in slow rivulets down the grain.\nThere was a breathless pause. One, two, three… Severard screamed. He wailed,\nand jerked, and trembled, his face quivering. Painful, eh? Welcome to my world.\nGlokta worked his aching foot around in his boot. 'Who would ever have thought\nthat our charming association, so enjoyable and profitable to us both, could possibly\nend like this? Not my choice. Not mine. Tell me who you spoke to. Tell me what\nyou said. Then this unpleasantness will all be over. Otherwise…'\nBang! The end of his little finger, now, and three more pieces of the rest. His\nmiddle finger was down to the knuckle, almost. Severard stared, his eyes wide with\nhorror, his breath coming in short, fast gasps. Shock, amazement, stunned terror.\nGlokta leaned down to his ear. 'I hope you weren't planning to take up the violin,"

Damn it.\nFrost had already tightened a tourniquet round Severard's wrist and manacled the\nbloody remains of his left hand back to the chair.

Does his conscience nag at him, I wonder,\nwhen the sun goes down? I doubt it. I give the orders after all. And I act on orders\nfrom Sult, on advice from Marovia, on the demands of Valint and Balk. What\nchoice do any of us have, in the end? Why, the excuses almost make themselves.\nFrost's white face was dusted with bloody red specks as he spread Severard's\nright hand out on the table, just where the left one had been.

We are left with more questions than before, and nowhere to\nlook for the answers. He arched his back, wincing at the aches in his twisted spine,\ndown his twisted leg, through his toeless foot. Sult must have gained his\ninformation elsewhere. Who else survived Dagoska, who else saw enough? Eider?\nShe would never dare reveal herself. Vitari? If she wanted to spill her guts she\ncould have done it at the time. Cosca? His Eminence would never work with a\nman that unpredictable. I only use him myself because I have no other choice.\nThen who?\nGlokta's eyes met Frost's. Pink eyes, unblinking. They stared at him, bright and\nhard as pink gemstones. And the wheels clicked into place.\nI see.\nNeither one of them spoke. Frost reached out, without much haste, his eyes never\nleaving Glokta's, and wrapped both his thick arms around Severard's neck. The\nex-Practical could only stare, helpless.\n'What're—' Frost frowned slightly. There was a sharp crunching sound as he\nwrenched Severard's head sideways. As simple and careless as killing a chicken.\nSeverard's skull flopped backwards as Frost let him go, and far past backwards,\nunnatural knobbly shapes sticking from the pale skin of his twisted neck.\nThe albino stood up, between Glokta and the door, hanging ajar. No way out.\nGlokta winced as he stumbled backwards, the tip of his cane scraping against the\nfloor. 'Why?' Frost came on, slowly and surely, his white fists clenched tight, his\nwhite face expressionless behind his mask. Glokta held up one hand. 'Just tell me\nwhy, damn it!'\nThe albino shrugged. I suppose some questions have no answers, after all.\nGlokta's twisted back hit the curved wall. And my time is up. Ah well. He took a\nlong breath. The odds were always stacked against me.

I do not mind dying, so\nvery much.\nFrost raised his white fist, then grunted. The cleaver sank deep into his heavy\nshoulder with a dull smack. Blood began to leak out from it into his shirt. Frost\nturned. Ardee stood behind him. The three of them stared at each other for a\nmoment. Then Frost punched her in the face. She reeled away and crashed into the\nside of the table, slid limp to the floor, dragging it over on its side, Glokta's case\nclattering down beside her, instruments tumbling, blood and bits of flesh scattering.\nFrost started to turn back, the cleaver still wedged in his flesh, his left arm hanging\nlimp.\nGlokta's lips curled away from his empty gums. I do not mind dying. But I\nrefuse to be beaten.\nHe set his feet as best he could, ignoring the pain that stabbed through his toeless\nfoot and up his front leg. He brought up his cane and jammed his thumb into its\nhidden catch. It had been made to his precise instructions by the same man who had\nmade the case for his instruments. And is an even finer piece of craftsmanship.\nThere was a gentle click as the wood sprang open on secret hinges and dropped\naway revealing a two-foot needle of mirror-bright metal. He let go a piercing shriek.\nJab, jab, Glokta. Jab, jab.\nThe steel was a blur. The first thrust ran Frost neatly through the left side of his\nchest. The second darted silently through the right side of his neck. The third\npunctured his mask and scraped against his jaw bone, the glinting point showing\nitself just under his white ear for an instant before it whipped back out.\nFrost stood, motionless, his white eyebrows going up with mild surprise. Then\nblood welled from the tiny wound on his throat and ran down into his shirt in a black\nline. He reached out with one big white hand. He wobbled, blood bubbling from\nunder his mask.\n'Futh,' he breathed.\nHe crumpled to the ground as though his legs had been snatched suddenly from\nunder him. He put out an arm to push himself up, but there was no strength in it. His\nbreaths gurgled noisily, then quietly, and he was still. And that is all.\nArdee was sitting up near the table, blood running out of her nose and down her\ntop lip. 'He's dead.'\n'I used to fence,' murmured Glokta. 'It seems the trick never entirely leaves you.'\nHe stared from one corpse to the other. Frost lay in a slowly widening dark pool,\none pink eye staring ahead, still unblinking, even in death. Severard's head was\nhanging back over the chair, mouth yawning wide open in a silent scream, his\nmutilated hand still manacled, the other hanging limp. My boys. My eyes. My hands.\nAll finished. He frowned at the bloody length of metal in his fist. Well. We must\nfumble onwards as best we can without them.\nHe winced as he reached down and picked up the fallen piece of his cane"

We must\nfumble onwards as best we can without them.\nHe winced as he reached down and picked up the fallen piece of his cane\nbetween two fingers, snapped it shut around the bloody steel. 'If you wouldn't mind\nclosing that case for me.' Ardee stared wide-eyed at the instruments, at Severard's\nyawning corpse, at the blood-stained table on its side and the fragments of flesh\nscattered across the floor. She coughed, and pressed the back of her hand to her\nmouth. One forgets that some people are not used to dealing with these matters.\nBut we need such help as we can get, and it is a little late for easing anyone into\nthis gently. If she can chop into a man with a cleaver, she can carry a blade or\ntwo for me without swooning. 'The case,' he snapped. 'I will still need my\ninstruments.'\nArdee blinked, collected the few scattered tools with trembling hands and put\nthem back in their places. She wedged the box under her arm and stood up,\nsomewhat unsteadily, wiping the blood from her nose on her white sleeve. Glokta\nnoticed that she had a piece of one of Severard's fingers caught in her hair.\n'You have something…' he pointed at his head, 'just here.'\n'What? Gah!' She tore the dead thing out and flung it on the ground, gave a shiver\nof disgust. 'You should find another way to make a living.'\n'I have been thinking that for some time. But there are still a few more questions I\nmust have answered.'\nThe door creaked and Glokta felt a sudden stab of panic. Cosca stepped through\ninto the room. He whistled softly as he surveyed the carnage, pushed his cap back\non his head, its feather casting a spray of long shadows across the mural behind him.\n'You've made quite a mess, Superior, quite a mess.'\nGlokta fingered his cane. His leg was on fire, his heart was thumping dully at his\ntemples, he was damp with cold sweat under his scratchy clothes. 'Unavoidable.'\n'I thought you'd want to know that we had our visitors. Six Practicals of the\nInquisition. I rather suspect they may have been sent here to kill you.' Undoubtedly.\nOn the Arch Lector's orders, acting on information from the late Practical Frost.\n'And?' asked Glokta. After the events of the past hour he was almost expecting\nCosca to come at him, sword swinging.\nBut if the last hour has taught us anything, it is that the least trusted henchman\nis not always the least reliable. 'And we cut them to pieces, of course.' The Styrian\ngrinned. 'I'm insulted you might think otherwise.'\n'Good. Good.' At least something has gone to plan. Glokta wanted nothing\nmore than to slide to the floor and lie there, screaming. But there is work to do. He\nwinced as he limped for the door.

There was still mist on the air, but it\nwas fading, now. A fine day in prospect, it would appear. A fine day for bloodshed,\ntreachery, and—\nShapes were moving in the mist, away south down the wide cobbled road,\ntowards the sea. There were noises too. Rattling, jingling. It sounded very much like\na body of armoured men on the move. Further off, someone was shouting. A bell\nbegan to clang, sullen and muffled. A warning bell.\nCosca frowned into the thinning mist. 'What is that?'\nThe shapes grew more distinct. Armoured men, carrying spears, and in numbers.\nTheir tall helmets were plainly not of Union design.\nArdee touched Glokta on the arm. 'Are they—'\n'Gurkish.' Their armour glinted in the thin, grey light as the fog drifted aside. A\nvast body of them, marching north up the Middleway. They must finally have\nlanded men at the docks, broken through into the centre of the city. What\nastonishingly poor timing. 'Back!' Glokta turned towards the alley, slipped and\nnearly fell, grimacing as Ardee caught him by the elbow and dragged him up straight.\n'Back to the mansion!' And hope we weren't seen already. 'And keep those\nlamps with you, we'll need them.' He hurried to the stinking alley as best he could,\nbarged and jostled by Cosca's mercenaries.\n'Damn these Gurkish,' hissed the Styrian. 'I don't know for the life of me what I\ndid to upset them so.'\n'You have my sympathy.' The gate squealed shut and a couple of the mercenaries\nstarted dragging a broken fountain behind it. I'm not sure how long that will keep\nout one of the Emperor's legions.\n'Might I ask what the plan is now, exactly, Superior? Charming though your\npalace is, sitting here and waiting for relief would hardly seem to be an option.'\n'No.' Glokta struggled up the steps and through the open front door. 'We need to\nget to the Agriont.'\n'Something tells me our Gurkish friends will have had the same idea. We will not\nbe getting there overground, that is certain.'\n'Then we must go underground.' Glokta limped into the guts of the building as\nsmartly as he could, Ardee and the mercenaries following behind in a worried crowd.\n'There is an entrance to the sewers here. One can get all the way to the Agriont, if\none knows the route.'\n'Sewers?' Cosca grinned. 'I like nothing more than wading through life's filth, as\nyou well know, but sewers can be quite… confusing. Do you know the route?'\n'Actually, no.' But I know a man who says he can find a way through anything,\neven a river of shit. 'Brother Longfoot!' he called out as he hobbled towards the\nsteps.

        "text": "steps. 'I have a proposition for you!'\nThe Day of Judgement\n« ^ »\nLord Marshal West stood in the shadow of an abandoned barn, up on a rise above\nthe fertile plains of Midderland, his eye-glass clutched tightly in one gloved hand.\nThere was still a trace of morning mist clinging to the flat autumn fields—patchworks\nof brown, green, yellow, stabbed with trees, slashed with bare hedgerows. In the\ndistance West could see the outermost walls of Adua, a stern grey line pimpled with\ntowers. Behind, in a lighter grey, the vague shapes of buildings jutted skywards.\nAbove them loomed the towering ghost of the House of the Maker, stark and\nunrepentant. All in all, it was a grim homecoming.\nThere was not so much as a breath of wind. The crisp air was strangely still. Just\nas if there was no war, no rival armies drawing up, no bloody battles scheduled to\nbegin. West swept his eye-glass back and forth, but he could scarcely see any hint\nof the Gurkish. Perhaps he imagined a tiny fence, down there before the walls,\nperhaps the outlines of pin-prick spears, but at this distance, in this light, he could be\nsure of nothing.\n'They must be expecting us. They must be.'\n'Maybe they're sleeping late,' said Jalenhorm, ever the optimist.\nPike was more direct. 'What difference if they are?'\n'Not much,' West admitted. King Jezal's orders had been specific. The city was\ninfested with Gurkish troops and the defences were close to complete collapse.\nThere was no time for clever stratagems, for careful approaches, for probing the\nenemy for weak spots. Prince Ladisla, ironically, would probably have been as good\na commander for this particular situation as anyone else. For once, circumstances\ncalled for a magnificent charge, followed closely by death or glory. The only thing\nunder West's control was the timing.\nBrint pulled up his horse nearby, sending a shower of grit into the cold air. He\nswung down from the saddle and gave a smart salute. 'General Kroy's cavalry is in\nposition on the right wing, Lord Marshal, and ready to charge at your order.'\n'Thank you, Captain. His foot?'\n'Perhaps halfway to deploying. Some companies are still spread out down the\nroads.'\n'Still?'\n'Muddy-going, sir.'\n'Huh.' Armies left mud behind them like a slug left a trail. 'What about Poulder?'\n'A similar position, as far as I can tell,' said Brint. 'No messages?'\nJalenhorm shook his head. 'General Poulder has not been forthcoming this\nmorning.'\nWest stared towards the city, that distant grey line beyond the fields. 'Soon.' He\nchewed at his lip, already raw from his constant worrying. 'Very soon. Mustn't let fly\nhalf-drawn. When a little more of the foot comes up…'\nBrint was frowning off to the south. 'Sir, is that…' West followed his pointing\nfinger. Over on the left wing, where Poulder had been gathering his division, the\ncavalry were already moving smartly forward.\nWest stared as the riders gathered pace. 'What the…'"

'What the…'\nTwo full regiments of heavy horse broke into a majestic gallop. Thousands of\nthem, streaming forwards across the open farmland, surging round the trees and the\nscattered farmhouses, throwing up a wake of dusty earth. West could hear the\nhammering of their hooves now, like distant thunder, could almost feel the vibration\nof it through his boots. The sun glinted on raised sword and lance, on shield and full\narmour. Banners streamed and snapped in the wind. It was quite the display of\nmartial grandeur. A scene from a lurid storybook with a muscular hero in which\nmeaningless words like honour and righteousness were often repeated.\n'Shit,' growled West through gritted teeth, feeling the familiar pulsing coming up\nbehind his eyes. General Poulder had been itching to mount one of his fabled cavalry\ncharges all across the North and back. There the harsh terrain, or the harsh weather,\nor the harsh circumstances had all prevented it. Now, with the perfect conditions, it\nseemed he had been unable to resist the opportunity.\nJalenhorm slowly shook his head. 'Bloody Poulder.'\nWest gave a snarl of frustration, raised up his eye-glass to dash it on the ground.\nHe managed to stop himself at the last moment, forced in a heavy breath, and\nslapped the thing angrily closed. He could not afford to indulge himself today. 'Well,\nthat's it then, isn't it? Order the charge, all across the line!'\n'Sound the charge!' roared Pike. 'The charge!'\nThe sharp bugle call rang out, blaringly loud on the chill morning air, doing\nnothing to ease West's throbbing headache. He stuck one muddy boot in his stirrup\nand dragged himself reluctantly up into his saddle, already sore from riding all night.\n'I suppose we must follow General Poulder to glory. At a less honourable distance,\nthough, perhaps. Someone still needs to co-ordinate this shambles.' The sounds of\nanswering bugles further down the line floated up to them, and on the right Kroy's\nhorsemen began to trot forwards.\n'Major Jalenhorm, order the foot forward in support as soon as they come up.'\nWest worked his mouth. 'Piecemeal if need be.'\n'Of course, Lord Marshal.' The big man was already turning his horse to give the\norders.\n'War,' muttered West. 'A noble business.'\n'Sir?' asked Pike.\n'Nothing.'\nJezal took the last few steps two at a time, Gorst and a dozen of his Knights\nclattering after him, sticking to his heels as tightly as his shadow. He swept\nimperiously past the guard and into the bright morning light at the top of the Tower\nof Chains, high above the stricken city. Lord Marshal Varuz was already at the\nparapet, surrounded by a gaggle of his staff, all glaring out across Adua. The old\nsoldier stood stiffly, his hands clasped behind him, just the way he had always done\nat fencing practice, long ago. Jezal had never noticed his hands shake in the old"

Jezal had never noticed his hands shake in the old\ndays, however. They shook now, and badly. High Justice Marovia stood beside him,\nblack robes stirred by the gentle breeze.\n'The news?' demanded Jezal.\nThe Lord Marshal's tongue darted nervously over his lips. 'The Gurkish mounted\nan assault before dawn. The defenders of Arnault's wall were overwhelmed. Not\nlong afterwards they managed to land men at the docks. A great number of men. We\nhave been fighting a rearguard action with the greatest courage, but… well…'\nThere was really no need to say more. As Jezal moved closer to the parapet, and\nwounded Adua came into view, he could plainly see the Gurkish flooding down the\nMiddleway, the tiny golden standards of the Emperor's legions bobbing above the\nmass of humanity like flotsam on a glittering tide. Like seeing one ant on the carpet,\nthen gradually becoming aware of hundreds all across his living room, Jezal began to\nnotice movement elsewhere, then everywhere. The very centre of the city was\ninfested with Gurkish soldiers.\n'Fighting a rearguard action with… mixed success,' finished Varuz lamely.\nDown below, a few men burst out from the buildings near the western gate of the\nAgriont, ran across the cobbled square before the moat, heading for the bridge.\n'Gurkish?' someone squealed.\n'No,' muttered the Lord Marshal. 'Those are ours.' Men doing their very best to\nescape the slaughter that was no doubt taking place down in the ruined city. Jezal\nhad faced death often enough to guess at how they felt.\n'Have those men brought to safety,' he said, voice cracking slightly.\n'I am afraid… the gates have been sealed, your Majesty.'\n'Then unseal them!'\nVaruz' dewy eyes wandered nervously to Marovia. 'That would… not be wise.'\nA dozen or more had made it to the bridge now, were shouting and waving their\narms. Their words were lost over the distance, but the tone of helpless, abject terror\nwas impossible to miss.\n'We should do something.' Jezal's hands gripped tight to the parapet. 'We must\ndo something! There will be others out there, many more!'\nVaruz cleared his throat. 'Your Majesty—'\n'No! Have my horse saddled. Gather the Knights of the Body. I refuse to—'\nHigh Justice Marovia had moved to block the door to the stairs, and now looked\ncalmly, sadly into Jezal's face. 'If you were to open the gates now, you would be\nputting everyone in the Agriont at risk. Many thousands of citizens, all looking to\nyou for protection. Here we can keep them safe, at least for now. We must keep\nthem safe.' His eyes slid sideways to the streets. Different-coloured eyes, Jezal\nnoticed, one blue, one green.

        "text": "'The greater good.' Jezal looked the other way, into the Agriont. Brave defenders\nwere ranged around the walls, he knew, ready to fight to the death for king and\ncountry, however undeserving. He pictured civilians too, scurrying for safety\nthrough the narrow lanes. Men, women, children, the old and the young, driven from\ntheir ruined homes. People to whom he had promised safety. His eyes flickered\nacross the high white buildings around the green park, the wide Square of Marshals,\nthe long Kingsway with its tall statues. They were filled, he knew, with the helpless\nand the needy. Those unlucky enough to have no one better to rely on than the\ngutless fraud, Jezal dan Luthar.\nIt stuck in his throat, but he knew the old bureaucrat was right. There was nothing\nhe could do. He had been shockingly lucky to survive his last magnificent charge,\nand it was far too late for another. Outside the Agriont, Gurkish soldiers were\nbeginning to boil into the square before the gate. A few of them knelt, bows in hand,\nand sent a flight of arrows arcing across onto the bridge. Tiny figures tumbled and\nfell, splashed into the moat. Tiny screams wafted gently up to the top of the Tower\nof Chains.\nAn answering volley rattled from the walls, peppered the Gurkish with flatbow\nbolts. Men dropped, others faltered and fell back, leaving a few bodies scattered\nacross the cobbles. They scurried for cover in the buildings around the edge of the\nsquare, men darting through the shadows from house to house. A Union soldier\njumped from the bridge and splashed along in the moat for a few strokes before\ndisappearing. He did not resurface. Behind him a last handful of the stranded\ndefenders were still crawling, desperately holding up their arms. The notion of the\ngreater good was likely to be scant consolation for them as they choked their last\nbreaths. Jezal squeezed his eyes shut and looked away.\n'There! To the east!'\nVaruz and a few members of his staff had clustered around the far parapet,\ngazing out past the House of the Maker and towards the distant fields outside the\ncity. Jezal strode over to them, shielded his eyes against the rising sun. Beyond the\ngreat wall of the Agriont, beyond the shining river and the wide curve of the city, he\nthought he caught some trace of movement. A wide crescent of movement, crawling\nslowly towards Adua.\nOne of the officers lowered an eye-glass. 'Cavalry! Union Cavalry!'\n'Are you sure?'\n'The Army!'\n'Late to the party,' muttered Varuz, 'but no less welcome for that.'\n'Hurrah for Marshal West!'\n'We are delivered!'\nJezal was in no mood to whoop for joy. Hope was a fine thing, of course, and\nhad long been in short supply, but celebrations were decidedly premature. He\ncrossed back to the other side of the tower and frowned down.\nMore Gurkish were surging into the square outside the citadel, and more still, and\nthey were coming well prepared.

The\nforemost of them already bristled with flatbow bolts, but they continued to creep\ntowards the bridge. Arrows flitted up and down. The wounded fell, did their best to\ncrawl for the rear. One of the buildings at the side of the square had already caught\nfire, flames licking hungrily round the eaves of its roof.\n'The army!' someone whooped from the opposite battlement. 'Marshal West!'\n'Indeed.' Marovia frowned down at the carnage below, the sounds of battle\ngrowing steadily more frantic. 'Let us hope he has not come too late.'\nThe noise of fighting crept up through the cool air. Clashing and clicking, echoing\ncalls. Logen glanced left and right at the men around him, jogging forward over the\nopen fields, quick breath hissing, gear rattling, all blunt frowns and sharp weapons.\nHardly a heartening thing, to be part of all this again.\nThe sad fact was that Logen had felt more warmth and more trust with Ferro and\nJezal, Bayaz and Quai than he did with his own kind now. They'd been a difficult set\nof bastards, each in their own way. It wasn't that he'd really understood them, or\neven liked them much. But Logen had liked himself when he was with them. Out\nthere in the deserted west of the World, he'd been a man you could rely on, like his\nfather had been. A man with no bloody history breathing on his shoulder, no name\nblacker than hell, no need to watch his back every moment. A man with hopes for\nsomething better.\nThe thought of seeing those folk again, the chance at being that man again, put\nthe spur to him, made Logen want to run at the grey wall of Adua all the faster. It\nseemed, in that moment anyway, as if he might be able to leave the Bloody-Nine\noutside it.\nBut the rest of the Northmen didn't share his eagerness. It was closer to a stroll\nthan a charge. They ambled up to a stand of trees, a couple of birds went flapping\ninto the white sky, and they stopped altogether. No one said anything. One lad even\nsat down, with his back to a tree, and started supping water from a flask.\nLogen stared at him. 'By the dead, I don't reckon I ever saw such a piss-weak\ncharge as this. Did you leave your bones back in the North?'\nThere was a bit of mumbling, a few shifty looks. Red Hat glanced sideways, his\ntongue wedged into his bottom lip. 'Maybe we did. Don't get me wrong, chief, or\nyour Royal Highness, or whatever it is now.' He bowed his head to show he meant\nno disrespect by it. 'I've fought before and hard enough, had my life balanced on a\nsword's edge, and all o' that. Just, well… why fight now, is what I'm saying. What\nwe're all thinking, I reckon. Ain't none of our business, is it? Ain't our fight, this.'\nDogman shook his head. 'The Union are going to take us for a right crowd o'\ncowards.'"

'Look, chief, I don't care much of a shit whether\nsome fool I don't know thinks I'm a coward. I've spilled enough blood for that. We\nall have.'\n'Huh,' grunted Logen. 'So your vote's to stay here, then, is it?'\nRed Hat shrugged. 'Well, I guess—' He squawked as Logen's forehead crunched\ninto his face, smashing his nose like a nut on an anvil. He dropped hard on his back\nin the mud, spluttering blood down his chin.\nLogen turned round, and he let his face hang on one side, the way he used to.\nThe Bloody-Nine's face—cold and dead, caring for nothing. It was easy to do it.\nFelt as natural on him as a favourite pair of boots. His hand found the cold grip of\nthe Maker's sword, and all around him men eased back, shuffled away, muttered and\nwhispered.\n'Any other one o' you cunts want a vote?'\nThe lad dropped his flask in the grass and jumped up from where he'd been\nsitting. Logen gave a few of them his eye, one by one, whoever looked hardest, and\none by one they looked at the ground, at the trees, at anything but him. Until he\nlooked at Shivers. That longhaired bastard stared straight back at him. Logen\nnarrowed his eyes. 'How about you?'\nShivers shook his head, hair swaying across his face. 'Oh no. Not now.'\n'When you're ready, then. When any one o' you are ready. Until then, I'll have\nsome work out o' you. Weapons,' he growled.\nSwords and axes, spears and shields were all made ready quick-time. Men fussed\nabout, finding their places, competing all of a sudden to be the first to charge. Red\nHat was just getting up, wincing with one hand to his bloody face. Logen looked\ndown at him. 'If you're feeling hard done by, think on this. In the old days you'd be\ntrying to hold your guts in about now.'\n'Aye,' he grunted, wiping his mouth. 'Right y'are.' Logen watched him walk off\nback to his boys, spitting blood. Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say he's got a\ntalent for turning a friend into an enemy.\n'Did you have to?' asked the Dogman.\nLogen shrugged. He hadn't wanted it, but he was leader now. Always a disaster,\nbut there it was, and a man in charge can't have men putting questions. Just can't\nhave it. They come with questions first, then they come with knives. 'Couldn't see\nanother way. That's how it's always been, ain't it?'\n'I was hoping times changed.'\n'Times never change. You have to be realistic, Dogman.'\n'Aye.

And this time\nlike we care a shit!' He started off through the trees, hearing the rest of the lads\nfollowing. Out into the open air, and the walls of Adua loomed up, a sheer grey cliff\nat the top of a grassy rise, studded with round towers. There were quite a number of\ncorpses lying around. Enough to give even a battle-hardened Carl some cold\nfeelings. Gurkish corpses mostly, from the colour of their skin, sprawled among all\nkinds of broken gear, squashed into muddy earth, trampled with hoof-prints.\n'Steady!' shouted Logen as he jogged on through them. 'Steady!' He caught sight\nof something up ahead, a fence of sharpened stakes, the body of a horse hanging\ndead from one of them. Behind the stakes, men moved. Men with bows.\n'Cover up!' A few arrows came zipping down. One thudded into Shivers' shield,\na couple more into the ground round Logen's feet. A Carl not a stride from him got\none in the chest and tumbled over.\nLogen ran. The fence came wobbling towards him, a good bit slower than he'd\nhave liked. Someone stood between two of the stakes, dark-faced, with a shining\nbreastplate, a red plume on his pointed helmet. He was shouting to a crowd of\nothers gathered behind him, waving a curved sword. A Gurkish officer, maybe. As\ngood a thing to charge at as any. Logen's boots squelched at the churned-up\nground. A couple more arrows spun past him, hastily aimed. The officer's eyes went\nwide. He took a nervous step back, raised his sword.\nLogen jerked to his left and the curved blade thudded into the turf at his feet. He\ngrowled as he swung the Maker's sword round and the heavy length of metal clanged\ndeep into the officer's bright breastplate, left a great dent in it. He screeched, then\ntottered forwards, all doubled up and hardly able to gasp in a breath. His sword\nspun out of his hand and Logen hit him on the back of his head, crushed his helmet\nand sent him sprawling in the mud.\nHe looked to the others, but not one of them had moved. They were a\ntattered-looking set, like a dark-skinned version of the weakest kind of Thralls.\nHardly the ruthless bastards he'd expected from the way that Ferro had always\ntalked about the Gurkish. They huddled together, spears sticking out this way and\nthat. A couple even had bows with arrows nocked, probably could have stuck him\nlike a hedgehog, but they didn't. Still, charging right at them might well have been the\nvery thing to wake them up. Logen had taken an arrow or two in his time and he\ndidn't fancy another.\nSo instead of coming forward, he stood up tall, and he gave a roar. A fighting\nroar, like the one he'd given when he charged down the hill at Carleon, all those years\nago, when he still had all his fingers and all his hopes intact. He felt the Dogman"

Then Red Hat, with his bloody face, and Grim, and all the rest, yelling their\nwar cries.\nThey stood in a long line, shaking their weapons, beating them crashing together,\nroaring and screaming and whooping at the tops of their voices, making a sound as\nif hell itself had opened up and a crowd of devils was singing welcome. The brown\nmen watched them, staring and trembling, their mouths and their eyes wide open.\nLogen didn't reckon they'd ever seen anything like this before.\nOne of them dropped his spear. Didn't mean to, maybe, just so struck with the\nnoise and the sight of all these crazy hairy bastards his fingers came open. It fell\nanyway, whether he meant it or not, and that was it, they all started dropping their\ngear. Fast as they could, it clattered down in the grass. Seemed stupid to keep\nshouting, and the war cries died out, left the two groups of men staring at each other\nin silence across that stretch of mud, planted with bent stakes and twisted corpses.\n'Strange kind o' battle, that,' muttered Shivers.\nThe Dogman leaned towards Logen. 'What do we do with 'em now we've got\n'em?'\n'We can't just sit hear minding 'em.'\n'Uh,' said Grim.\nLogen chewed at his lip, spun his sword round and round in his hand, trying to\nthink of some clever way to come at this. He couldn't see one. 'Might as well just let\n'em go.' He jerked his head away north. None of them moved, so he tried it again,\nand pointed with his sword. They cringed and muttered to each other when he lifted\nit, one of them falling over in the mud. 'Just piss off that way,' he said, 'and we've\ngot no argument. Just piss… off… that way!' He stabbed with the sword again.\nOne of them got the idea now, took a cautious step away from the group. When\nno one struck him dead, he started running. Soon enough the others followed him.\nDogman watched the last of them shamble off. Then he shrugged his shoulders.\n'Good luck to 'em, then, I guess.'\n'Aye,' muttered Logen. 'Good luck.' Then, so quiet that no one could hear, 'Still\nalive, still alive, still alive…'\nGlokta limped through the reeking gloom, down a fetid walkway half a stride across,\nhis tongue squirming into his empty gums with the effort of staying upright, wincing\nall the way as the pain in his leg grew worse and worse, doing his best not to breathe\nthrough his nose.

How wrong I was.\nCosca and his mercenaries formed a single file with Glokta in their midst, their\ncursing, grumbling, slapping footfalls echoing up and down the vaulted tunnel, the\nlight from their swinging lamps casting swaying shadows over the glistening stone.\nRotten black water dripped from above, trickled down the mossy walls, gurgled in\nslimy gutters, rushed and churned down the reeking channel beside him. Ardee\nshuffled along behind with his instruments clasped under one arm. She had\nabandoned any attempt to hold up the hem of her dress and the fabric was well\nstained with black slurry. She looked up at him, damp hair hanging across her face,\nand made a weak effort at a smile. 'You certainly do take a girl to the very best\nplaces.'\n'Oh, indeed. My knack for finding romantic settings no doubt explains my\ncontinuing popularity with the fairer sex.' Glokta winced at a painful twinge. 'Despite\nbeing a crippled monstrosity. Which way are we heading, now?'\nLongfoot hobbled along in front, tethered by a rope to one of the mercenaries.\n'North! Due north, give or take. We are just beside the Middleway.'\n'Huh.' Above us, not ten strides distant, are some of the most fashionable\naddresses in the city. The shimmering palaces and a river of shit, so much closer\ntogether than most would ever like to believe. Everything beautiful has a dark side,\nand some of us must dwell there, so that others can laugh in the light. His snort of\nlaughter turned to a squeak of panic as his toeless foot slid on the sticky walkway.\nHe flailed at the wall with his free hand, fumbled his cane and it clattered to the slimy\nstones. Ardee caught his elbow before he fell and pulled him upright. He could not\nstop a girlish whimper of pain hissing out from the gaps in his teeth.\n'You're really not enjoying yourself, are you?'\n'I've had better days.' He smacked the back of his head against the stone as\nArdee leaned down to retrieve his cane. 'To be betrayed by both,' he found himself\nmuttering. 'That hurts. Even me. One I expected. One I could have taken. But both?\nWhy?'\n'Because you're a ruthless, plotting, bitter, twisted, self-pitying villain?' Glokta\nstared at her, and she shrugged. 'You asked.' They set off once again through the\nnauseating darkness.\n'The question was meant to be rhetorical.'\n'Rhetoric? In a sewer?'\n'Wait up, there!' Cosca held up his hand and the grumbling procession shuffled\nto a halt again. A sound filtered down from above, softly at first, then louder—the\nrhythmic boom of tramping feet, seeming to come, disconcertingly, from everywhere\nat once.

Those bastards don't give up, eh?'\n'They've moved quickly,' grunted Glokta as he tried to catch his breath.\n'No one much fighting in the streets any more, I imagine. All pulled back to the\nAgriont, or surrendered.'\nSurrendering to the Gurkish. Glokta winced as he stretched out his leg. Rarely a\ngood idea, and not one a man I would ever consider twice. 'We must hurry, then.\nMove along there, Brother Longfoot!'\nThe Navigator hobbled on. 'Not much further, now! I have not led you wrong, oh\nno, not I! That would not have been my way.

It was\nas if snow had come suddenly, only here, and left a thin blanket across the smooth\nflags. Across the dark stone, and across the bright metal.\n'Good.' Bayaz nodded with rare satisfaction. 'Very good!'\n'Is that all, my Lord?' called their foreman from the midst of their cringing group.\n'Unless any of you wish to stay, and witness the destruction of the indestructible\nHundred Words?'\nThe foreman squinted sideways at one of his fellows with some confusion. 'No.\nNo, I think we'll just… you know…' He and the rest of the workmen began to back\noff, taking their empty barrels with them. Soon they were away between the white\npalaces. Ferro and Bayaz were left alone in all that flat expanse of dust.\nJust the two of them, and the Maker's box, and the thing that it contained.\n'So. The trap is set. We need merely wait for our quarry.' Bayaz tried his knowing\ngrin, but Ferro was not fooled. She saw his gnarled hands fussing with each other,\nthe muscles clenching and unclenching on the side of his bald head. He was not sure\nif his plans would work. However wise he was, however subtle, however cunning, he\ncould not be sure. The thing in the box, the cold and heavy thing that Ferro longed\nto touch, was an unknown. The only precedent for its use was far away, in the\nempty wastes of the Old Empire.

There were a few folk scattered on the walls over the archway, cheering and\nwhooping like they were at a wedding. A fat man in a leather apron was standing on\nthe other side of the tunnel, clapping folk on the back as they came past. 'Thank\nyou, friend! Thank you!' He shoved something into Dogman's hand, grinning like a\nmadman all the way. A loaf of bread.\n'Bread.' Dogman sniffed at it, but it smelled alright. 'What the hell's all that about?'\nThe man had a whole heap of loaves on a cart. He was handing them out to any\nsoldier that came past, Union or Northman. 'Who's he, anyway?'\nGrim shrugged. 'A baker?'\nThere weren't much time to think on it. They were all getting shoved together into\na big space full of men pushing, and grumbling, and making mess. All kind of\nsoldiers and some old men and women round the edge, starting to get tired of\ncheering. A well-clipped lad in a black uniform was standing on top of a cart in the\nmidst of this madness and screeching like a lost goat.\n'Eighth regiment, towards the Four Corners! Ninth towards the Agriont! If you're\nwith the tenth you came through the wrong damn gate!'\n'Thought we were to the docks, Major!'\n'Poulder's division are dealing with the docks!

'Northmen!'\nThe lad stared at them, wide-eyed, then he threw up his hands. 'Just get in there!\nIf you see any Gurkish, kill them!' He turned back towards the gate, jerking his\nthumb over his shoulder into the city. 'Ninth regiment towards the Agriont!'\nLogen scowled. 'We'll get no sense here.' He pointed down a wide street, full of\nwalking soldiers. Some great tall tower poked up above the buildings. Huge thing,\nmust've been built on a hill. 'We get split up. we'll just aim at that.'

He was too busy staring at the houses down either side of the road.\nHouses the like of which he'd never seen in his life. Made of little square, red stones,\nand black wood filled in with white render. Each one of 'em was big enough for a\nchieftain to be happy with, most with glass windows in as well.\n'Bloody palaces, eh?'\nLogen snorted. 'You think this is something? You should see this Agriont we're\naiming at. The buildings they got there. You never dreamed o' the like. Carleon's a\npigsty beside this place.'\nDogman had always found Carleon a good bit too built-up. This was downright\nridiculous. He dropped back a way, found he was walking next to Shivers. He lore\nthe loaf and held one half out.\n'Thanks.' Shivers took a bite out of the end, then another. 'Not bad.'\n'Ain't nothing quite like it, is there? That taste o' new bread? Tastes like… peace,\nI guess.'\n'If you say so.' They chewed together for a while, saying nothing.\nDogman looked sideways. 'I think you need to put this feud o' yours behind you.'\n'What feud's that?'\n'How many you got? The one with our new king up there. Ninefingers.'\n'Can't say I haven't tried.' Shivers frowned up the road at Logen's back. 'But\nwhenever I turn around, there it is beside me.'\n'Shivers, you're a good man. I like you. We all do. You got bones, lad, and\nbrains too, and men'll follow you. You could go a long way if you don't get yourself\nkilled, and there's the problem. I don't want to see you start up something you can't\nput a good end to.'\n'You needn't worry then. Anything I start I'll make sure I finish.'\nDogman shook his head. 'No, no, that ain't my point, lad, not at all. Maybe you\ncome out on top, maybe you don't. My point is neither one's a victory. Blood makes\nblood, and nothing else. My point is it ain't too late for you. It ain't too late for you\nto be better'n that.'\nShivers frowned at him. Then he tossed the heel of bread away, turned his big\nshoulder and headed off without another word. Dogman sighed. Some things can't\nbe put right just with talk. Some things can't be put right at all.\nThey came out from the maze of buildings and onto a river. It must've been as\nwide as the Whiteflow, only the banks on each side were made of stone. The biggest\nbridge the Dogman had ever seen spanned it, railings made of curly iron, wide\nenough to drive two carts across side by side. Another wall stood at the far end,\neven bigger than the one they came through first. Dogman took a few gawping steps"

Even Grim had a twist to his face that might've been surprise.\n'Bloody hell,' said Shivers. 'You ever see the like o' this?'\nDogman's neck was aching from staring round at it all.

The one-eyed mercenary slid\nout a long knife and sawed through the rope round Longfoot's wrists. 'It would be\nbest if I didn't ever see you again.'\nThe Navigator had the ghost of a grin on his face. 'Don't worry, Superior. I was\nonly this moment thinking the very same thing.' He hobbled back the way they had\ncome, down the dank stairway towards the sewers, rounded a corner and was gone.\n'Tell me you brought the things,' said Glokta.\n'I'm untrustworthy, Superior. Not incompetent.' Cosca flicked a hand at the\nmercenaries. 'Time, my friends. Let's black up.'\nAs a unit they pulled out black masks and buckled them on, pulled off their\nragged coats, their torn clothes. Every man wore clean black underneath, from head\nto toe, with weapons carefully stowed. In a few moments a crowd of criminal villains\nwas transformed into a well-ordered unit of Practicals of his Majesty's Inquisition.\nNot that there's too much of a leap from one to the other."

He took off his hat, flicked at the filthy feather. 'Can I keep\nit?'\n'No.'\n'You're a hard man, Superior.' He grinned as he tossed the cap away into the\nshadows. 'And I love you for it.' He pulled his own mask on, then frowned at Ardee,\nstanding, confused and exhausted in a corner of the store-room. 'What about her?'\n'Her? A prisoner, Practical Cosca! A spy in league with the Gurkish. His\nEminence expressed his desire to question her personally.' Ardee blinked at him. 'It's\neasy. Just look scared.'\nShe swallowed. 'That shouldn't be a problem.'\nWandering through the House of Questions with the aim of arresting the Arch\nLector? I should say not. Glokta snapped his fingers.

Brint tried to push his horse further, but they were\nsquashed in by a grumbling throng. Spears waved, their points flailing dangerously\nclose. Soldiers cursed. Sergeants bellowed. Officers clucked like frustrated\nchickens. It was hard to imagine more difficult terrain than the narrow streets behind\nthe docks through which to manoeuvre an army of thousands. To make matters\nworse there was now an ominous flow of wounded, limping or being carried, in the\nopposite direction.\n'Make some room for the Lord Marshal!' roared Pike. 'The Lord Marshal!' He\nlifted his sword as though he was more than willing to lay about him with the flat,\nand men rapidly cleared out of the way, a valley forming through the rattling spears.\nA rider came clattering up out of their midst. Jalenhorm, a bloody cut across his\nforehead.\n'Are you alright?'\nThe big man grinned. 'It's nothing, sir. Caught my head on a damn timber.'\n'Progress?'\n'We're forcing them back towards the western side of the city.

'Bloody hell.'\nWest could only agree.\nThe graceful curve of Adua's docks had been transformed into a crescent of\ncarnage. Near to them the quay was blackened, wasted, scattered with broken gear\nand broken bodies. Further off, crowds of men were struggling in ill-formed groups,\npolearms sticking up in all directions like hedgehog's spines, the air heavy with their\nnoise. Union battle-flags and Gurkish standards flailed like scarecrows in the breeze.\nThe epic conflict covered almost the entire long sweep of the shoreline. Several\nwarehouses were in flames, sending up a shimmering heat-haze, lending a ghostly air\nto the hundreds of men locked in battle beyond them. Long smears of choking\nsmoke, black, grey, white, rolled from the burning buildings and out into the bay.\nThere, in the churning harbour, a host of ships was engaged in their own desperate\nstruggle.\nVessels ploughed this way and that under full sail, turning, tacking, jockeying for\nposition, flinging glittering spray high into the air. Catapults hurled flaming missiles,\narchers on the decks loosed flaming volleys, sailors crawled high in the cobwebs of\nrigging. Other ships were locked together in ungainly pairs by rope and grapple, like\nfighting dogs snapping at one another, glinting sunlight showing men in savage melée\non their decks. Stricken vessels limped vainly, torn sailcloth hanging, slashed rigging\ndangling. Several were burning, sending up brown columns of smoke, turning the\nlow sun into an ugly smudge.\nWreckage floated everywhere on the frothing water—barrels, boxes, shivered\ntimbers and dead sailors.\nWest knew the familiar shapes of the Union ships, yellow suns stitched into their\nsails, he could guess which were the Gurkish vessels. But there were others there\ntoo—long, lean, black-hulled predators, each one of their white sails marked with a\nblack cross. One in particular towered far over every other vessel in the harbour, and\nwas even now being secured at one of the few wharves still intact.\n'Nothing good ever comes from Talins,' muttered Pike.\n'What the hell are Styrian ships doing here?'\nThe ex-convict pointed to one in the very act of ramming a Gurkish ship in the\nside. 'Fighting the Gurkish, by the look of it.'\n'Sir,' somebody asked. 'What shall we do?'\nThe eternal question. West opened his mouth, but nothing came out. How could\none man hope to exert any measure of control over the colossal chaos spread out\nbefore him? He remembered Varuz, in the desert, striding around with his huge staff\ncrowding after him.

A dozen watchful guards in black\narmour flanked a single man. He had black hair streaked with grey, sported a pointed\nbeard, immaculately trimmed. He wore black boots, a fluted breastplate of black\nsteel, a cloak of black velvet flowing majestically from one shoulder. He was\ndressed, in fact, like the world's richest undertaker, but walked with the kind of\nsteely self-importance reserved for the highest royalty. He plotted a direct course\ntowards West, looking neither left nor right, the dumbfounded guards and staff\nforced effortlessly aside by his air of command like iron filings parted by magnetic\nrepulsion.\nHe held out his black-gauntleted hand. 'I am Grand Duke Orso, of Talins.'\nThe idea, perhaps, was that West should kneel and kiss it. Instead he seized it\nwith his own and gave it a firm shake. 'Your Excellency, an honour.' He had no idea\nif that was even the proper form of address. He had scarcely been expecting to\nencounter one of the most powerful men in the world in the midst of a bloody battle\non the docks of Adua. 'I am Lord Marshal West, commander of his Majesty's\nArmy. Not to appear ungrateful, but you are far from home—'\n'My daughter is your Queen. On her behalf, the people of Talins are prepared to\nmake any sacrifice. As soon as I heard of the…' He arched one black eyebrow at the\nburning harbour. 'Troubles, here, I prepared an expedition. The ships of my fleet, as\nwell as ten thousand of my best troops, stand at your disposal.'\nWest hardly knew how to respond. 'They do?'\n'I have taken the liberty of disembarking them. They are engaged in clearing the\nGurkish from the south-western quarter of the city. The Three Farms, is it called?'\n'Er… yes.'\nDuke Orso gave the thinnest of smiles.

He knew that he really should have been grateful for the\nsudden appearance of ten thousand helpful Styrian troops, but he could not escape\nthe nagging feeling that he would have been happier if Grand Duke Orso had never\narrived. For the time being, however, he had more pressing worries.\n'Lord Marshal!' It was Brint, hurrying down the quay at the front of a group of\nofficers. One side of his face was covered in a long smear of ash. 'Lord Marshal,\nGeneral Poulder—'\n'At long bloody last!' snapped West. 'Now perhaps we'll have some answers.\nWhere the hell is that bastard?' He shouldered Brint aside, and froze. Poulder lay on\na stretcher held by four muddy and miserable-looking members of his staff. He had\nthe expression of a man in peaceful sleep, to the degree that West kept expecting to\nhear him snore. A huge, ragged wound in his chest rather spoiled the effect,\nhowever.\n'General Poulder led the charge from the front,' said one of the officers,\nswallowing his tears. 'A noble sacrifice…'\nWest stared down. How often had he wished that man dead? He jerked one hand\nover his face at a sudden wave of nausea. 'Damn it,' he whispered.\n'Damn it!' hissed Glokta as he twisted his trembling ankle on the topmost step and\nnearly pitched onto his face. A bony Inquisitor coming the other way gave him a\nlong look. 'Is there a problem?' he snarled back. The man lowered his head and\nhurried past without speaking.\nClick, tap, pain. The dim hallway slid by with agonising slowness. Every step\nwas an ordeal, now, but he forced himself on, legs burning, foot throbbing, neck\naching, sweat running down his twisted back under his clothes, a rictus of toothless\nnonchalance clamped onto his face. At every gasp and grunt through the building he\nhad expected a challenge. With each twinge and spasm he had been waiting for the\nPracticals to flood from the doorways and butcher him and his thinly disguised\nhirelings like hogs.\nBut those few nervous people they had passed had scarcely looked up. Fear has\nmade them sloppy. The world teeters at a precipice. All scared to take a step in\ncase they put a foot into empty air. The instinct of self-preservation. It can destroy\na man's efficiency.\nHe lurched through the open doors and into the ante-room outside the Arch\nLector's office. The secretary's head jerked angrily up. 'Superior Glokta! You cannot\nsimply…' He stumbled on the words as the mercenaries began to tramp into the\nnarrow room behind him. 'I mean to say… you cannot…'\n'Silence! I am acting on the express orders of the king himself.' Well, everyone\nlies. The difference between a hero and a villain is whether anyone believes him.\n'Step aside!' he hissed at the two Practicals flanking the door, 'or be prepared to\nanswer for it.' They glanced at each other, then, as more of Cosca's men appeared,\nraised their hands together and allowed themselves to be disarmed. The instinct of\nself-preservation. A decided disadvantage."

The instinct of\nself-preservation. A decided disadvantage.\nGlokta paused before the doorway. Where I have cringed so often at the\npleasure of his Eminence. His fingers tingled against the wood. Can it possibly be\nthis easy? To simply walk up in broad daylight and arrest the most powerful man\nin the Union? He had to suppress a smirk. If only I had thought of it sooner. He\nwrenched the doorknob round and lurched over the threshold.\nSult's office was much as it had always been. The great windows, with their view\nof the University, the huge round table with its jewelled map of the Union, the ornate\nchairs and the brooding portraits. It was not Sult sitting in the tall chair, however. It\nwas none other than his favourite lapdog, Superior Goyle. Trying the big seat out\nfor size, are we? Far too big for you, I'm afraid.\nGoyle's first reaction was outrage. How dare anyone barge in here like this? His\nsecond was confusion. Who would dare to barge in here like this? His third was\nshock. The cripple? But how? His fourth, as he saw Cosca and four of his men\nfollow Glokta through the door, was horror. Now we're getting so mew here.\n'You!' he hissed. 'But you're—'\n'Slaughtered? Change of plans, I'm afraid. Where's Sult?'\nGoyle's eyes flickered around the room, over the dwarfish mercenary, the one\nwith a hook for a hand, the one with the hideous boils, and came to rest on Cosca,\nswaggering round the edge of the chamber with one fist on his sword-hilt.\n'I'll pay you! Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it!'\nCosca held out his open palm. 'I prefer cash in hand.'\n'Now? I don't have… I don't have it with me!'\n'A shame, but I work on the same principle as a whore. You'll buy no fun with\npromises, my friend. No fun at all.'\n'Wait!' Goyle stumbled up and took a step back, his trembling hands held up in\nfront of him. But there's nowhere to go but out the window. That's the trouble with\nambition. It's easy to forget, when you're always looking upwards, that the only\nway down from the dizzy heights is a long drop.\n'Sit down, Goyle,' growled Glokta.\nCosca grabbed his wrist, twisted his right arm savagely behind him and made him\nsqueal, forced him back into the chair, clamped one hand round the back of his head\nand smashed his face into the beautiful map of the Union. There was a sharp crunch\nas his nose broke, spattering blood across the western part of Midderland.\nHardly subtle, but then the time for subtlety is behind us. The Arch Lector's\nconfession, or someone close to him… Sult would have been better, but if we\ncannot have the brains, I suppose we must make do with the arsehole.

Ardee crept cautiously into the room, came slowly\nacross to the table and put the case down.\nGlokta snapped his fingers, pointed. The fat mercenary ambled up and took a\nfirm grip on Goyle's free arm, dragged it sharply out across the table. 'I expect you\nthink you know an awful lot about torture, eh, Goyle? Believe me, though, you don't\nreally understand a thing until you've spent some time on both sides of the table.'\n'You mad bastard!' The Superior squirmed, smearing blood across the Union\nwith his face. 'You've crossed the line!'\n'Line?' Glokta spluttered with laughter. 'I spent the night cutting the fingers from\none of my friends and killing another, and you dare to talk to me about lines?' He\npushed open the lid of the case and his instruments offered themselves up. 'The only\nline that matters is the one that separates the strong from the weak. The man who\nasks the questions from the man who answers them. There are no other lines.'\nHe leaned forward and ground the tip of his finger into the side of Goyle's skull.\n'That's all in your head! The manacles, if you please.'\n'Eh?' Cosca looked to the fat mercenary, and the man shrugged, the blurred\ntattoos on his thick neck squirming.\n'Pffft,' said the dwarf. Boil-face was silent. The one-handed mercenary had pulled\ndown his mask and was busy picking his nose with his hook.\nGlokta arched his back and gave a heavy sigh. There really is no replacement for\nexperienced help. 'Then I suppose we must improvise.' He scooped up a dozen\nlong nails and scattered them jingling across the table-top. He slid out the hammer,\nits polished head shining. 'I think you can see where we're going with this.'\n'No. No! We can work something out, we can—' Glokta pressed the point of one\nnail into Goyle's wrist. 'Ah! Wait! Wait—'\n'Would you be good enough to hold this? I have only one hand to spare.'\nCosca took the nail gingerly between finger and thumb. 'Mind where you aim with\nthe hammer, though, eh?'\n'Don't worry. I am quite precise.' An awful lot of practice.\n'Wait!' screeched Goyle.\nThe hammer made three metallic clicks, almost disappointingly quiet, as it drove\nthe nail cleanly between the bones of Goyle's forearm and into the table beneath. He\nroared with pain, spraying bloody spit over the table.\n'Oh, come now, Superior, compared to what you did to your prisoners in\nAngland this is really quite infantile. Try to pace yourself. If you scream like that\nnow, you'll have nowhere to go later.' The fat mercenary seized Goyle's other wrist\nin his pudgy hands and dragged it out across the map of the Union.\n'Nail?' asked Cosca, raising an eyebrow.\n'You're getting the hang of it.'\n'Wait! Ah! Wait!'\n'Why? This is the closest I've come to enjoying myself in six years. Don't"

I get so very few of them.' Glokta raised the hammer.\n'Wait!'\nClick. Goyle roared with pain again. Click. And again. Click. The nail was\nthrough, and the one-time scourge of Angland's penal colonies was pinned flat by\nboth arms. I suppose that's where ambition gets you without the talent. Humility is\neasier to teach than one would think. All it takes to puncture our arrogance is a\nnail or two in the right place. Goyle's breath hissed through his bloody teeth,\npinioned fingers clawing at the wood. Glokta disapprovingly shook his head. 'I\nwould stop struggling if I was you. You'll only tear the flesh.'\n'You'll pay for this, you crippled bastard! Don't think you won't!'\n'Oh, I've paid already.' Glokta turned his neck around in a slow circle, trying to\nmake the grumbling muscles in his shoulders unclench just a fraction. 'I was kept, I\nam not sure for how long, but I would guess at several months, in a cell no bigger\nthan a chest of drawers. Far too small to stand, or even to sit up straight in. Every\npossible position twisted, bent, agonising. Hundreds of interminable hours in the\npitch darkness, the stifling heat. Kneeling in a stinking slurry of my own shit,\nwriggling, and squirming, and gasping for air. Begging for water which my jailers let\ndrip down through a grate above. Sometimes they would piss through it, and I\nwould be grateful. I have never stood up straight since. I really have no idea how I\nremained sane.' Glokta thought about it for a moment, then shrugged. 'Perhaps I\ndidn't. In any case, these are the kind of sacrifices I have made. What sacrifices will\nyou make, just to keep Sult's secrets?'\nNo answer but the blood running out from under Goyle's forearms, pooling\naround the glittering stone that marked the House of Questions in the city of Keln.\n'Huh.' Glokta gripped his cane hard and leaned down to whisper in Goyle's ear.\n'There's a little bit of flesh, between your fruits and your arsehole. You never really\nsee it, unless you're a contortionist, or unnaturally fond of mirrors. You know the\none I'm talking about. Men spend hours thinking about the area in front of it, and\nalmost as long on the area behind, but that little patch of flesh? Unfairly ignored.' He\nscooped up a few nails and jingled them gently in Goyle's face. 'I mean to set that\nright, today. I'm going to start there, and work outwards, and believe me, once I'm\ndone, you'll be thinking about that patch of flesh for the rest of your life. Or you'll be\nthinking about where it used to be, at least. Practical Cosca, would you be kind\nenough to help the Superior out of his trousers?'\n'The University!' bellowed Goyle.

Almost disappointing. But then few bullies take a beating well.\n'What's he doing there, at a time like this?'\n'I… I don't—'\n'Not good enough. Trousers, please.'\n'Silber! He's with Silber!'\nGlokta frowned. 'The University Administrator?'\nGoyle's eyes darted from Glokta, to Cosca, and back again. He squeezed them\nshut. 'The Adeptus Demonic!'\nThere was a long pause. 'The what?'\n'Silber, he doesn't just run the University! He conducts… experiments.'\n'Experiments of what nature?' Glokta jabbed sharply at Goyle's bloody face with\nthe head of the hammer. 'Before I nail your tongue to the table.'\n'Occult experiments! Sult has been giving him money, for a long time! Since the\nFirst of the Magi came calling! Before, maybe!'\nOccult experiments? Funding from the Arch Lector? It hardly seems Sult's\nstyle, but it explains why those damn Adepti were expecting money from me when I\nfirst visited the place. And why Vitari and her circus have set up shop there now.\n'What experiments?'\n'Silber… he can make contact… with the Other Side!'\n'What?'\n'It's true! I have seen it! He can learn things, secrets, there is no other way of\nknowing, and now…'\n'Yes?'\n'He says he has found a way to bring them through!'\n'Them?'\n'The Tellers of Secrets, he calls them!'\nGlokta licked at his dry lips. 'Demons?' I thought his Eminence had no patience\nwith superstition, when all this time… The nerve of the man!\n'He can send them against his enemies, he says. Against the Arch Lector's\nenemies! They are ready to do it!'\nGlokta felt his left eye twitching, and he pressed the back of his hand against it. A\nyear ago I would have laughed to my boots and nailed him to the ceiling. But\nthings are different, now. We passed inside the House of the Maker. We saw\nShickel smile as she burned. If there are Eaters? If there are Magi? Why should\nthere not be demons? How could there not be? 'What enemies?'\n'The High Justice! The First of the Magi!' Goyle squeezed his eyes shut again.\n'The king,' he whimpered.\nAhhhh. The. King. Those two little words are my kind of magic. Glokta turned\nto Ardee, and showed her the yawning gap in his front teeth. 'Would you be so kind\nas to prepare a Paper of Confession?'\n'Would I…' She stared at him for a moment, eyes wide in her pale face, then\nhurried to the Arch Lector's desk, snatched up a sheet of paper and a pen, dipped it\nrattling in a bottle of ink.

How else but call it what it is? '\"To use diabolical arts against his\nMajesty the king and members of his Closed Council.\"'\nThe nib scratched clumsily over the paper, scattering specks of ink. Ardee held it\ncrackling out to him. 'Good enough?'\nHe remembered the beautiful documents that Practical Frost used to prepare. The\nelegant, flowing script, the immaculate wording. Each Paper of Confession, a work\nof art. Glokta stared sadly down at the ink-spotted daub in his hand.\n'But a brief step from unreadable, but it will serve.' He slid the paper under\nGoyle's trembling hand, then took the pen from Ardee and wedged it between his\nfingers. 'Sign.'\nGoyle sobbed, sniffed, scrawled his name at the bottom of the page as best he\ncould with his arm nailed down. I win, and for once the taste is almost sweet.\n'Excellent,' said Glokta. 'Pull those nails, and find some sort of bandage. It would\nbe a shame if he bled to death before he had the chance to testify. Gag him, though,\nI've heard enough for now. We'll take him with us to the High Justice.'\n'Wait! Wait! Wurghh—!' Goyle's cries were sharply cut off as the mercenary with\nthe boils wedged a wad of dirty cloth in his mouth. The dwarf slid the pliers from the\ncase. So far, and we are still alive. What ever are the odds of that? Glokta limped\nto the window and stood, stretching his aching legs. There was a muffled shriek as\nthe first nail was ripped from Goyle's arm, but Glokta's thoughts were elsewhere. He\nstared out towards the University, its spires looming up through the smoky murk like\nclawing fingers. Occult experiments? Summonings and sendings? He licked sourly\nat his empty gums. What is going on in there?\n'What is going on out there?' Jezal strode up and down the roof of the Tower of\nChains in a manner which he hoped was reminiscent of a caged tiger, but probably\nwas closer to a criminal on the morning of his own hanging.\nSmoke had drawn a sooty veil across the city and made it impossible to tell what\nwas happening any further than a half mile distant. Members of Varuz' staff,\nscattered around the parapets, would occasionally call out useless and wildly\ncontradictory news. There was fighting in the Four Corners, up the Middleway,\nthroughout the central part of the city. There was fighting on land and on sea. By\nturns all hope was lost and they were on the verge of deliverance. But one thing was\nin no doubt.

Below, beyond the moat of the Agriont, the Gurkish efforts continued\nominously unabated.\nA rain of flatbow bolts continued to pepper the square outside the gates, but for\nevery corpse the Gurkish left, for every wounded man dragged away, five more\nwould vomit out from the burning buildings like bees from a broken hive. Soldiers\nswarmed down there in teeming hundreds, enclosing the whole circuit of the Agriont\nin an ever-strengthening ring of men and steel. They squatted behind their wooden\nscreens, they shot arrows up towards the battlements. The pounding of drums had\ndrawn steadily closer and now echoed out around the city. Peering through his\neye-glass, with every muscle tensed to try and hold it steady, Jezal had begun to\nnotice strange figures scattered below.\nTall and graceful figures, conspicuous in pearly white armour edged with glinting\ngold, they moved among the Gurkish soldiers, pointing, ordering, directing. Often,\nnow, they were pointing towards the bridge that led to the west gate of the Agriont.\nDark thoughts niggled at the back of Jezal's mind. Khalul's Hundred Words? Risen\nup from the shadowy corners of history to bring the First of the Magi to justice?\n'If I didn't know better, I would have said that they were preparing for an assault.'\n'There is no cause for alarm,' croaked Varuz, 'our defences are impregnable.' His\nvoice quavered, then cracked entirely at the final word, doing little to give anyone the\nslightest reassurance. Only a few short weeks ago, nobody would have dared to\nsuggest that the Agriont could ever fall. But nobody would ever have dreamed that it\nwould be surrounded by legions of Gurkish soldiers, either. Very plainly, the rules\nhad changed. A deep blast of horns rang out.\n'Down there,' muttered one of his staff.\nJezal peered through his borrowed eye-glass. Some form of great cart had been\ndrawn up through the streets, like a wooden house on wheels, covered by plates of\nbeaten metal. Even now, Gurkish soldiers were loading barrels into it under the\ndirection of two men in white armour.\n'Explosive powder,' someone said, unhelpfully.\nJezal felt Marovia's hand on his arm. 'Your Majesty, it might be best if you were\nto retire.'\n'And if I am not safe here? Where, precisely, will I be out of danger, do you\nsuppose?'\n'Marshal West will soon deliver us, I am sure. But in the meantime the palace is\nmuch the safest place. I will accompany you.' He gave an apologetic smile. 'At my\nage, I fear I will be little use on the walls.'\nGorst held out one gauntleted hand towards the stairs. 'This way.'\n'This way,' growled Glokta, limping up the hall as swiftly as his ruined feet would\ncarry him, Cosca ambling after. Click, tap, pain.\nOnly one secretary remained outside the office of the High Justice, peering\ndisapprovingly over his twinkling eye-glasses. No doubt the rest have donned\nill-fitting armour and are manning the walls. Or, more likely, have locked\nthemselves in cellars. If only I were with them."

If only I were with them.\n'I am afraid his Worship is busy.'\n'Oh, he will see me, don't worry about that.' Glokta hobbled past without\nstopping, placed his hand on the brass doorknob of Marovia's office, and almost\njerked it back in surprise. The metal was icy cold. Cold as hell. He turned it with his\nfingertips and opened the door a crack. A breath of white vapour curled out into the\nhall, like the freezing mist that would hang over the snowy valleys in Angland in the\nmidst of winter.\nIt was deathly cold in the room beyond. The heavy wooden furniture, the old oak\npanelling, the grubby window panes, all glittered with white hoar-frost. The heaps of\nlegal papers were furry with it. A bottle of wine on a table by the door had shattered,\nleaving behind a bottle-shaped block of pink ice and a scattering of sparkling\nsplinters.\n'What in hell…' Glokta's breath smoked before his smarting lips. Mysterious\narticles were scattered widely about the wintry room. A long, snaking length of black\ntubing was frozen to the panelling, like a string of sausages left in the snow. There\nwere patches of black ice on the books, on the desk, on the crunching carpet. There\nwere pink fragments frozen to the ceiling, long white splinters frozen to the floor…\nHuman remains?\nA large chunk of icy flesh, partly coated in rime, lay in the middle of the desk.\nGlokta turned his head sideways to better take it in. There was a mouth, still with\nsome teeth attached, an ear, an eye. Some strands of a long beard. Enough, in the\nend, for Glokta to recognise whose parts were scattered so widely around the\nfreezing room. Who else but my last hope, my third suitor, High justice Marovia?\nCosca cleared his throat. 'It seems there is something to your friend Silber's\nclaims after all.'\nAn understatement of devilish proportions. Glokta felt the muscles round his left\neye twitching with a painful intensity. The secretary fussed up to the door behind\nthem, peered through, gasped, and reeled away. Glokta heard him being noisily sick\noutside. 'I doubt the High Justice will be lending us much assistance.'\n'True. But isn't it getting a little late in the day for your papers and so forth\nanyway?' Cosca gestured towards the windows, flecked and spotted with frozen\nblood. 'The Gurkish are coming, remember? If you've scores to settle, get them\nsettled now, before our Kantic friends tear up all the bills. When plans fail, swift\naction must serve, eh, Superior?' He reached behind his head, unbuckled his mask,\nand let it drop to the floor. 'Time to laugh in your enemy's face! To risk all on one\nfinal throw! You can pick up the pieces afterward. If they don't go back together,\nwell, what's the difference? Tomorrow we might all be living in a different world.'\nOr dying in one. Not the way we wanted it, maybe, but he is right. Perhaps we"

A man can be\nfearless on his own doorstep, against enemies he understands, but take him long\nmiles over the salty sea to strange places he never dreamed of, he'll take fright at\nevery empty doorway. And there were an awful lot of those, now.\nThe city of white towers, where Logen had hurried after the First of the Magi,\namazed at the scale of the buildings, the strangeness of the people, the sheer quantity\nof both, had become a maze of blackened ruins. They crept down empty streets,\nlined with the outsize skeletons of burned-out houses, charred rafters stabbing at the\nsky. They crept across empty squares, scattered with rubble and dusted with ash.\nAlways the sounds of battle echoed, ghostly—near, far, all around them.\nIt was as if they crept through hell.\n'How d'you fight in this?' whispered the Dogman.\nLogen wished he had an answer. Fighting in forests, in mountains, in valleys,\nthey'd done it all a hundred times, and knew the rules, but this? His eyes flickered\nnervously over the gaping windows and doorways, the piles of fallen stones.

The scored metal of the\nMaker's sword was slippery in his sweaty palm. He crept low to the ground, over a\nheap of rubble and along beside a shattered wall, his hand held flat behind him to say\ngo careful. He eased up to the edge, and peered around it.\nThe Agriont rose up just ahead, great walls and towers black against the white\nsky, a second set reflected in the moat below. A lot of men were gathered near the\nwater, crowded up and down the cobbled space as far as Logen could see. It didn't\ntake a sharp mind to realise they were Gurkish. Arrows flitted up towards the\nbattlements, bolts flitted back down, spinning from the cobbles, sticking wobbling\ninto wooden screens.\nNot thirty strides away they'd drawn up a line, facing into the city. A good, clean\nline, bristling with spears, set out on either side of a tall standard, golden letters\ntwinkling on it. A tough-looking line of hard men, well armed and well armoured,\nnothing like the rubbish they'd faced outside the walls. Logen didn't reckon shouting\nwas going to get this lot moving anywhere.

Armour rattled as the men set their spears.\n'Ah, shit,' hissed Logen. They came forward, fast, but organised. A mass of\nthem, and bristling with bright, sharp, deadly metal.\nThere are only three choices when you get charged. Run away, stand, or charge\nyourself. Running away isn't usually a bad option, but given the way the rest of the\nboys were feeling, if they ran they wouldn't stop running until they fell in the sea. If\nthey stood, all in a puzzled mess from coming through the city, the chances were\ngood that they'd break, and that would leave some dead and do nothing for the rest.\nWhich left one choice, and that's no choice at all.\nTwo charges in one day. Shitty luck, that, but there was no use crying about it.\nYou have to be realistic about these things.\nLogen started running. Not the way he wanted to, but forward, out from the\nbuildings and across the cobbles towards the moat. He didn't give too much thought\nto whether anyone was following. He was too busy screaming and waving his sword\naround. The first into the killing, just like in the old days. A fitting end for the\nBloody-Nine. Be a good song, maybe, if anyone could be bothered finding a tune\nfor it. He gritted his teeth, waiting for the terrible impact.\nThen a crowd of Union soldiers came pouring from the buildings on the left,\nshouting like madmen themselves.

The Gurkish charge faltered, their line began to\nbreak up, spears swinging wildly as men turned to face the sudden threat. An\nunexpected bonus, and no mistake.\nThe Union crashed into the end of the line. Men screeched and bellowed, metal\nshrieked on metal, weapons flashed, bodies dropped, and Logen fell into the midst\nof it. He slid past a wobbling spear, slashed at a Gurkish soldier. He missed and hit\nanother, sent him screaming, blood bubbling down chain-mail. He rammed into a\nthird with his shoulder and flung him on his back, stomped on the side of his jaw\nand felt it crunch under his boot.\nThe Gurkish officer who'd led the charge was only a stride away, his sword\nready. Logen heard a bow string behind and an arrow took the officer near the collar\nbone. He dragged in a shuddering breath to scream, half spinning round. Logen\nchopped a deep gash through his back-plate, spots of blood jumping. Men crunched\ninto the remains of the line around him. A spear shaft bent up and shattered sending\nsplinters flying in Logen's face. Someone roared right next to him and made his ear\nbuzz. He jerked his head away to see a Carl throw a desperate hand up, a curved\nsword sliced into it and sent a thumb spinning. Logen hacked the Gurkish soldier\nwho'd swung it in the face, the heavy blade of the Maker's sword catching him\nacross the cheek and splitting his skull wide.\nA spear flashed at him. Logen tried to turn sideways, gasped as the point slid\nthrough his shirt and down his right side, leaving a cold line under his ribs. The man\nwho held it stumbled on towards him, moving too quick to stop. Logen stabbed him\nright through, just under his breastplate, ended up blinking in his face. A Union\nsoldier with a patchy ginger beard on his cheeks.\nThe man frowned, puzzled at seeing another white face. 'Wha…' he croaked,\nclutching at him. Logen tore away, one hand pressed to his side. It was wet there. He\nwondered if the spear had nicked him or run him right through. He wondered if it\nhad killed him already, and he had just a last few bloody moments left.\nThen something hit him on the back of his head and he was reeling, bellowing,\nnot knowing what was happening. His limbs were made of mud. The world wobbled\nabout, full of flying dirt and flying edges. He hacked at something, kicked at\nsomething else. He grappled with someone, snarling, tore his hand free and fumbled\nout a knife, stabbed at a neck, black blood flowing. The sounds of battle roared and\nhummed in his ears. A man staggered past with part of his face hanging off. Logen\ncould see right inside his mangled mouth from the side, bits of teeth falling out.\nThe cut down his side burned, and burned, and sucked his breath out.

It's me!'\nLogen saw who it was. But it wasn't his hand that held the sword, now, and the\nBloody-Nine saw only work that needed doing.\nWhat a curious flock this crippled shepherd has acquired. Two dozen fake\nPracticals followed Glokta through the deserted lanes of the Agriont, Nicomo\nCosca, infamous soldier of fortune, swaggering at their head. My hopes all entrusted\nto the world's least trustworthy man. One of them dragged the bound and gagged\nSuperior Goyle stumbling along by a rope. Like an unwilling dog being taken for a\nwalk. Ardee West shuffled in their midst, her white dress stained with the filth of the\nsewers and the blood of several men, her face stained with darkening bruises and a\nhaunted slackness. No doubt the result of the several horrors she has already\nwitnessed today. All capering through the Agriont after the Inquisition's only\ncrippled Superior. A merry dance to hell, accompanied by the sounds of distant\nbattle.\nHe lurched to a sudden halt. An archway beside him led through into the Square\nof Marshals and, for some reason beyond his comprehension, the whole wide space\nhad been covered with sawdust. In the middle of that yellow-white expanse,\nperfectly recognisable even over this distance, the First of the Magi stood, waiting.\nBeside him was the dark-skinned woman who had nearly drowned Glokta in his\nbath. My two favourite people in all the world, I do declare.\n'Bayaz,' hissed Glokta.\n'No time for that.' Cosca caught him by the elbow and pulled him away, and the\nFirst of the Magi and his sullen companion passed out of view. Glokta limped on,\ndown the narrow lane, winced as he turned a corner, and found himself staring\ndirectly into the face of his old acquaintance Jezal dan Luthar. Or, should I say, the\nHigh King of the Union. I am painfully honoured.\n'Your Majesty,' he said, lowering his head and causing a particularly unpleasant\nstabbing through his neck. Cosca, just appearing beside him, gave an extravagant\nbow, reaching for his cap to sweep it from his head. It was gone. He shrugged his\nshoulders apologetically, and tugged at his greasy forelock.\nLuthar frowned at him, and at each member of his strange group as they\nappeared. Someone seemed to be lurking at the back of the royal entourage. A robe\nof black and gold in amongst all that polished steel. Could that be… our old friend\nthe High Justice? But surely he is in frozen pieces—Then Ardee shuffled around\nthe corner.\nLuthar's eyes went wide. 'Ardee…'\n'Jezal…' She looked every bit as amazed as he did.

'I mean—'\nAnd the air was ripped apart by a colossal explosion.\nThe Middleway was not what it used to be.\nWest and his staff rode northwards in stunned silence. Their horses' hooves\ntapped at the cracked road. A sorry bird cheeped from the bare rafters of a\nburned-out house. Someone in a side street squealed for help. From the west the\nvague sounds of fighting still echoed, like the noise of a distant sporting event, but\none with no winners. Fire had swept through the centre of the city, turning whole\nswathes of buildings to blackened shells, the trees to grey claws, the gardens to\npatches of withered slime. Corpses were the only addition. Corpses of every size\nand description.\nThe Four Corners was a slaughter-yard, scattered with all the ugly garbage of\nwar, bounded by the ruined remains of some of Adua's finest buildings. Near at\nhand, the wounded were laid out in long rows on the dusty ground, coughing,\ngroaning, calling for water, bloody surgeons moving helplessly among them.\nA few grim soldiers were already piling the Gurkish dead into formless heaps,\nmasses of tangled arms, legs, faces. They were watched over by a tall man with his\nhands clenched behind his back. General Kroy, always quick to put things in order.\nHis black uniform was smudged with grey ash, one torn sleeve flapping around his\nwrist. The fighting must have been savage indeed to make a mark on his perfect\npresentation, but his salute was unaffected. It could not have been more impeccable\nif they stood on a parade ground.\n'Progress, General?'\n'Bitter fighting through the central district, Lord Marshal! Our cavalry broke\nthrough this morning and we took them by surprise. Then they counterattacked while\nwe were waiting for the foot. I swear, this weary patch of ground has changed hands\na dozen times. But we have the Four Corners, now! They're fighting hard for every\nstride, but we're driving them back towards Arnault's wall. Look at that, now!' He\npointed to a pair of Gurkish standards leaning against a length of crumbling\nmasonry, their golden symbols gleaming in the midst of that drab destruction.\n'They'll make a fine centrepiece to anyone's living room, eh, sir?'\nWest could not stop his eyes wandering down to a group of groaning wounded\nlolling against the wall below. 'I wish you joy of them. The Agriont?'\n'The news is less good there, I'm afraid. We're pushing them hard, but the\nGurkish are up in numbers. They still have the citadel entirely surrounded.'\n'Push harder, General!'\nKroy snapped out another salute. 'Yes, sir, we'll break them, don't you worry.\nMight I ask how General Poulder is doing with the docks?'\n'The docks are back in our hands, but General Poulder… is dead.'\nThere was a pause. 'Dead?' Kroy's face had turned deathly pale. 'But how did\nhe—'\nThere was a rumble, like thunder in the distance, and the horses shied, pawed at\nthe ground.

West's face, and Kroy's, and the faces of their officers, all turned as one\nto the north. There, over the tops of the blackened ruins at the edge of the square, a\ngreat mass of dust was rising high above the Agriont.\nThe bright world spun and throbbed, full of the beautiful song of battle, the\nwonderful taste of blood, the fine and fruitful stink of death. In the midst of it, no\nfurther than arms length away, a small man stood, watching him.\nTo come so close to the Bloody-Nine? To ask for death as surely as to step into\nthe searing fire. To beg for death. To demand it.\nSomething about his pointed teeth seemed familiar. A faint memory, from long\nago. But the Bloody-Nine pushed it away, shook it off, sunk it in the bottomless sea.\nIt meant nothing to him who men were, or what they had done. He was the Great\nLeveller, and all men were equal before him. His only care was to turn the living into\nthe dead, and it was past time for the good work to begin. He raised the sword.\nThe earth shook.\nHe stumbled, and a great noise washed over him, tore between the dead men and\nthe living, split the world in half. He felt it knock something loose inside his skull. He\nsnarled as he righted himself, lifted the blade high…\nExcept the arm would not move.\n'Bastard…' snarled the Bloody-Nine, but the flames were all burned out. It was\nLogen who turned towards the noise.\nA vast cloud of grey smoke was rising up from the wall of the Agriont a few\nhundred strides away. Spinning specks flew up high, high above it leaving arching\ntrails of brown dust in the sky, like the tentacles of some vast sea-monster. One\nseemed to reach its peak just above them. Logen watched it fall. It had looked like a\npebble at first. As it tumbled slowly down he realised it was a chunk of masonry the\nsize of a cart.\n'Shit,' said Grim. There was nothing else to say. It crashed through the side of a\nbuilding right in the midst of the fight. The whole house burst apart, flinging broken\nbodies in every direction. A broken timber whirred past the Dogman and splashed\ninto the moat. Specks of grit nipped at the back of Logen's head as he flung himself\nto the ground.\nChoking dirt billowed out across the road. He retched, one hand over his face.\nHe wobbled up to standing, the dusty world lurching around him, using his sword as\na crutch, ears still ringing from the noise, not sure who he was, let alone where.\nThe bones had gone right out of the battle by the moat. Men coughed, stared,\nwandered in the gloom. There were a lot of bodies, Northmen, Gurkish, Union, all\nmixed up together. Logen saw a dark-skinned man staring at him, blood running\ndown his dusty face from a cut above one eye.\nLogen lifted his sword, gave a throaty roar, tried to charge and ended up"

The Gurkish soldier dropped his spear\nand ran off into the murk.\nThere was a second deafening detonation, this one even closer, off to the west. A\nsudden blast of wind ripped at Jezal's hair, nipped at his eyes. Swords rang from\nsheaths. Men stared up, faces slack with shock.\n'We must go,' piped Gorst, taking a firm grip on Jezal's elbow.\nGlokta and his henchmen were already making off down a cobbled lane, as\nquickly as the Superior could limp. Ardee gave one brief look over her shoulder,\neyes wide.\n'Wait…' Seeing her like that had given Jezal a sudden and painful rush of longing.\nThe idea of her in the thrall of that disgusting cripple was almost too much to bear.\nBut Gorst was having none of it.\n'The palace, your Majesty.' He ushered Jezal away towards the park without a\nbackward glance, the rest of the royal bodyguard clattering after. Fragments of stone\nbegan to click off the roofs around them, to bounce from the road, to ping from the\narmour of the Knights of the Body.\n'They are coming,' muttered Marovia, staring grimly off towards the Square of\nMarshals.\nFerro squatted, hands held over her head, the monstrous echoes still booming from\nthe high white walls. A stone the size of a man's head fell out of the sky and burst\napart on the ground a few strides away, black gravel scattering across the pale\nsawdust. A boulder ten times as big crashed through the roof of a building, sent\nglass tinkling from shattered windows. Dust billowed out from the streets and into\nthe square in grey clouds. Gradually the noise faded. The man-made hailstorm rattled\nto a stop, and there was a pregnant silence.\n'What now?' she growled at Bayaz.\n'Now they will come.' There was a crash somewhere in the streets, the sound of\nmen shouting, then a long scream suddenly cut off. He turned towards her, his jaw\nworking nervously. 'Once we begin, do not move from the spot. Not a hair. The\ncircles have been carefully—'\n'Keep your mind on your own part, Magus.'\n'Then I will. Open the box, Ferro.'\nShe stood, frowning, her fingertips rubbing at her thumbs. Once it was opened,\nthere would be no going back, she felt it.\n'Now!' snapped Bayaz. 'Now, if you want your vengeance!'\n'Sssss.' But the time for going back was far behind her. She squatted down,\nlaying her hand on the cool metal of the lid. A dark path was the only choice, and\nalways had been. She found the hidden catch and pressed it in. The box swung\nsilently open, and that strange thrill seeped, then flowed, then poured out over her\nand made the air catch in her throat.\nThe Seed lay inside, nestling on its metal coils, a dull, grey, unremarkable lump."

Lead-heavy and ice-cold, she lifted it from the box.\n'Good.' But Bayaz was wincing as he watched her, face twisted with fear and\ndisgust. She held it out towards him and he flinched back. There were beads of\nsweat across his forehead. 'Come no closer!'\nFerro slammed the box shut. Two Union guards, clad in full armour, were\nbacking into the square, heavy swords in their fists. There was a fear in the way they\nmoved, as if they were retreating from an army. But only one man rounded the\ncorner. A man in white armour, worked with designs of shining metal. His dark face\nwas young, and smooth, and beautiful, but his eyes seemed old. Ferro had seen\nsuch a face before, in the wastelands near Dagoska.\nAn Eater.\nThe two guards came at him together, one shouting a shrill battle-cry. The Eater\nshrugged effortlessly around their swords, came forward in a sudden blur, caught\none of the Union men with a careless flick of his open hand. There was a hollow\nclang as it caved in his shield and breastplate both, lifted him flailing into the air. He\ncrunched down some twenty strides from where he had been standing, rolled over\nand over leaving dark marks in the pale sawdust. He flopped to rest not far from\nFerro, coughed out a long spatter of blood and was still.\nThe other guard backed away. The Eater looked at him, a sadness on his perfect\nface. The air around him shimmered, briefly, the man's sword clattered down, he\ngave a long squeal and clutched at his head. It burst apart, showering fragments of\nskull and flesh across the walls of the white building beside him. The headless\ncorpse slumped to the ground. There was a pause.\n'Welcome to the Agriont!' shouted Bayaz.\nFerro's eyes were drawn up by a flash of movement. High above, a figure in\nwhite armour dashed across a roof. They made an impossible leap across the wide\ngap to the next building and vanished from sight. In the street below a woman\nflowed out of the shadows and into the square, dressed in glittering chain-mail. Her\nhips swayed as she sauntered forwards, a happy smile on her flawless face, a long\nspear carried loose in one hand. Ferro swallowed, shifted her fist around the Seed,\ngripping it tight.\nPart of a wall collapsed behind her, blocks of stone tumbling out across the\nsquare. A huge man stepped through the ragged gap, a great length of wood in his\nhands, studded with black iron, his armour and his long beard coated in dust. Two\nothers followed, a man and a woman, all with the same smooth skin, the same young\nfaces and the same old, black eyes. Ferro scowled round at them as she slid her\nsword out, the cold metal glinting. Useless, maybe, but holding it was some kind of\ncomfort.\n'Welcome to you all!' called Bayaz.

'I have been waiting for you, Mamun!'\nThe first of the Eaters frowned as he stepped carefully over the headless corpse.\n'And we for you.' White shapes flitted from the roofs of the buildings, thumped\ndown into the square in crouches, and stood tall. Four of them, one to each corner.\n'Where is that creeping shadow, Yulwei?'\n'He could not be with us.'\n'Zacharus?'\n'Mired in the ruined west, trying to heal a corpse with a bandage.'\n'Cawneil?'\n'Too much in love with what she used to be to spare a thought for what comes.'\n'You are left all alone, then, in the end, apart from this.' Mamun turned his empty\ngaze on Ferro. 'She is a strange one.'\n'She is, and exceptionally difficult, but not without resources.' Ferro scowled,\nand said nothing. If anything needed saying, she could talk with her sword. 'Ah,\nwell.' Bayaz shrugged. 'I have always found myself my own best council.'\n'What choice have you? You destroyed your own order with your pride, and\nyour arrogance, and your hunger for power.' More figures stepped from doorways\nround the square, strolled unhurried from the streets. Some strutted like lords. Some\nheld hands like lovers. 'Power is all you ever cared for, and you are left without even\nthat. The First of the Magi, and the last.'\n'So it would seem. Does that not please you?'\n'I take no pleasure in this, Bayaz. This is what must be done.'\n'Ah. A righteous battle? A holy duty? A crusade, perhaps? Will God smile on\nyour methods, do you think?'\nMamun shrugged. 'God smiles on results.' More figures in white armour spilled\ninto the square and spread out around its edge. They moved with careless grace,\nwith effortless strength, with bottomless arrogance. Ferro frowned around at them,\nthe Seed clutched tight at one hip, her sword at the other.\n'If you have a plan,' she hissed. 'Now might be the time.'\nBut the First of the Magi only watched as they were surrounded, the muscles\ntwitching on the side of his face, his hands clenching and unclenching by his sides.\n'A shame that Khalul himself could not pay a visit, but you have brought some\nfriends with you, I see.'\n'One hundred, as I promised. Some few have other tasks about the city. They\nsend their regrets. But most of us are here for you. More than enough.' The Eaters\nwere still. They stood facing inwards, spread out in a great ring with the First of the\nMagi at their centre. Ferro Maljinn felt no fear, of course.\nBut these were poor odds.\n'Answer me one thing,' called Mamun, 'since we are come to the end. Why did\nyou kill Juvens?'\n'Juvens? Ha! He thought to make the world a better place with smiles and good\nintentions. Good intentions get you nothing, and the world does not improve without"

His eyes were feverish\nbright, now, his scalp glistened with sweat. 'But what does it matter who killed who a\nthousand years ago? What matters is who dies today.'\n'True. Now, at last, you will be judged.' Slowly, very slowly, the circle of Eaters\nbegan to contract, stepping gently forward as one, drawing softly inwards.\nThe First of the Magi gave a grim smile. 'Oh, there will be a judgement here,\nMamun, on that you can depend. The magic has drained from the world. My Art is a\nshadow of what it was. But you forgot, while you were gorging yourselves on human\nmeat, that knowledge is the root of power. High Art I learned from Juvens. Making I\ntook from Kanedias.'\n'You will need more than that to defeat us.'\n'Of course. For that I need some darker medicine.'\nThe air around Bayaz' shoulders shimmered. The Eaters paused, some of them\nraised their arms in front of their faces. Ferro narrowed her eyes, but there was only\nthe gentlest breath of wind. A subtle breeze, that washed out from the First of the\nMagi in a wave, that lifted the sawdust from the stones and carried it out in a white\ncloud to the very edge of the Square of Marshals.\nMamun looked down, and frowned. Set into the stone beneath his feet, metal\nshone dully in the thin sunlight. Circles, and lines, and symbols, and circles within\ncircles, covering the entire wide space in a single vast design.\n'Eleven wards, and eleven wards reversed,' said Bayaz. 'Iron. Quenched in salt\nwater. An improvement suggested by Kanedias' researches. Glustrod used raw salt.\nThat was his mistake.'\nMamun looked up, the icy calmness vanished from his face. 'You cannot\nmean…' His black eyes flickered to Ferro, then down to her hand, clenched tight\naround the Seed. 'No! The First Law—'\n'The First Law?' The Magus showed his teeth. 'Rules are for children. This is\nwar, and in war the only crime is to lose. The word of Euz?' Bayaz' lip curled. 'Hah!\nLet him come forth and stop me!'\n'Enough!' One of the Eaters leaped forward, flashing across the metal circles\ntowards their centre. Ferro gasped as the stone in her hand turned suddenly, terribly\ncold. The air about Bayaz twisted, danced, as though he was reflected in a rippling\npool.\nThe Eater sprang up, mouth open, the bright blade of his sword shining. Then he\nwas gone. So were two others behind him. A long spray of blood was smeared\nacross the ground where one of them had been standing. Ferro's eyes followed it,\ngrowing wider and wider.

The gates rattled slightly against the mighty beams,\nand the notion of hiding in the cellar gained appeal with astonishing speed.\n'A line!' barked Gorst's shrill voice. 'To the King!' A wall of heavily-armoured\nmen clustered instantly around Jezal, swords drawn, shields raised. Others kneeled in\nfront, pulling bolts from quivers, turning the cranks of their heavy flatbows. All eyes\nwere fixed on the mighty double doors. They rattled gently again, wobbled slightly.\n'Down there!' someone called from the walls above.

The Eater raised one hand, as if in blessing.\n'May God admit us all to heaven.'\n'Loose!' squealed Gorst. Flatbows rattled and popped. A couple of bolts glanced\noff the Eater's armour, a couple more thudded into flesh, one under the breastplate,\nanother in the shoulder. One bolt caught it right through the face, the flights sticking\nout just below the eye. Any man should have dropped dead before them. The Eater\nsprang forwards with shocking speed.\nOne of the Knights raised his flatbow in a feeble attempt to defend himself. The\nspear split it in two and sliced him cleanly in half at the belly, chopped into another\nman with an echoing clang and sent him tumbling through the air into a tree ten\nstrides away. Fragments of dented armour and splintered wood flew. The first\nKnight made a strange whistling sound as his top half tumbled to the path, showering\nhis dumbstruck comrades with gore.\nJezal was jostled back, could see nothing more than flashes of movement\nbetween his bodyguards. He heard screams and groans, clashing metal, saw swords\nglinting, gouts of blood flying. An armoured body flew into the air, flopping like a\nrag-doll, crunched into a wall on the other side of the gardens.\nThe bodies swayed apart. The Eater was surrounded, swinging its spear in\nblinding circles. One ripped into a man's shoulder and knocked him shrieking to the\nground, the shaft splintering with the force of the blow and the blade spinning away\nedge-first into the turf. A Knight charged in from behind and spitted the Eater\nthrough the back, the glittering point of his halberd sliding bloodless through the\nwhite armour on its chest. Another Knight struck its arm off with an axe and dust\nshowered from the stump. The Eater screeched, hit him across the chest with a\nbackhanded blow that crushed his breastplate and drove him sighing into the dirt.\nA sword-cut squealed through the white armour, sending dust flying up as if from\na beaten carpet. Jezal stared dumbly as the Eater reeled towards him. Gorst shoved\nhim out of the way, growling as he brought his long steel round to hack deep into the\nEater's neck with a meaty thud. It flailed, silently, its head hanging off by a flap of\ngristle, brown dust pouring from its yawning wounds. It clutched at Gorst with its\nremaining hand and he staggered, face twisted with pain, sank to his knees as it\nwrenched his arm around.\n'Here's heaven, bastard!' Jezal's sword chopped through the last bit of neck and\nthe Eaters' head dropped onto the grass. It let go of Gorst and he clutched at his"

It let go of Gorst and he clutched at his\nmangled forearm, the shape of the Eater's hand dented into his heavy armour. The\nheadless body slowly toppled over. 'Cursed thing!' Jezal took one step and kicked\nits head across the garden, watched it bounce and roll into a flower bed leaving a\ntrail of dust through the grass. Three men stood over the body, their heavy breath\nechoing from inside their helmets, their swords flashing in the sun as they hacked it\ninto pieces. Its fingers were still twitching.\n'They're made of dust,' someone whispered.\nMarovia frowned at the remains. 'Some are. Some bleed. Each one is different.\nWe should get inside the palace!' he shouted as he hurried across the gardens.\n'There will be more of them!'\n'More?' Twelve Knights of the Body lay dead. Jezal swallowed as he counted\ntheir broken and bloody, dented and battered corpses. The best men the Union had\nto offer, scattered around the palace gardens like heaps of scrap metal among the\nbrown leaves. 'More? But how do we—?' The gates shuddered. Jezal's head\nsnapped towards them, the blind courage of the fight fading quickly and sick panic\nrushing in behind it.\n'This way!' roared Marovia, holding open a door and beckoning desperately. It\nwas not as though there were other choices. Jezal rushed towards him, caught one\ngilded boot with the other three steps in, and went sprawling painfully on his face.\nThere was a cracking, a tearing, a squealing of wood and metal behind. He clawed\nhis way onto his back to see the gates torn apart in a cloud of flying timber. Broken\nplanks spun through the air, bent nails pinged from the pathways, splinters settled\ngently across the lawns.\nA woman sauntered through the open gateway, the air still shimmering gently\naround her tall, thin body. A pale woman with long, golden hair. Another walked\nbeside her, just the same except that her left side was spattered from head to toe with\nred blood. Two women, happy smiles on their beautiful, perfect, identical faces. One\nof them slapped a Knight Herald across the head as he charged up, tearing his\nwinged helmet from his shattered skull and sending it spinning high into the air. The\nother turned her black, empty eyes on Jezal. He struggled up and ran, wheezing with\nfear, slid through the door beside Marovia and into the shadowy hallway, lined with\nancient arms and armour.\nGorst and a few Knights of the Body tumbled through after him. Over their\nshoulders the one-sided battle in the gardens continued. A man raised a flatbow only\nto explode in a shower of blood. An armoured corpse crashed into a Knight just as\nhe turned to run, sent him hurtling sideways through a window, sword spinning from\nhis hand. Another ran towards them, arms pumping, tumbled down a few strides\naway, thrashing on the ground, flames spurting from the joints in his armour.\n'Help me!' someone wailed. 'Help me! Help—' Gorst slammed the heavy doors"

Help—' Gorst slammed the heavy doors\nshut with his one good arm, one of his fellows dropped the thick bar into the\nbrackets. They tore old polearms from the walls, one with a tattered battle-flag\nattached, and started wedging them in the doorway.\nJezal was already backing away, cold sweat tickling at his skin under his armour,\ngripping tight to the hilt of his sword more for reassurance than defence. His\ndrastically denuded entourage stumbled back with him—Gorst, Marovia, and but\nfive others, their gasping, horrified breath echoing in the dim corridor, all staring\ntowards the door.\n'The last gate did not hold them,' Jezal whispered. 'Why should this one?'\nNo one answered.\n'Keep your wits about you, gentlemen,' said Glokta. 'The door, please.' The fat\nmercenary took his axe to the front gate of the University. Splinters flew. It wobbled\nat the first blow, shuddered at the second, tore open at the third. The one-eyed\ndwarf slithered through, a knife in either hand, closely followed by Cosca, sword\ndrawn. 'Clear,' came his Styrian drawl from inside, 'if fusty.'\n'Excellent.' Glokta looked at Ardee. 'It might be best if you stayed towards the\nback.'\nShe gave an exhausted nod. 'I was thinking the same.' He limped painfully over\nthe threshold, black-clad mercenaries pouring through the doorway behind him, the\nlast of them dragging Goyle reluctantly by his bandaged wrists. And along the very\npaths I took the first time I visited this heap of dust, so many months ago. Before\nthe vote. Before Dagoska, even. How lovely to be back…\nDown the dark hallway, past the dirty paintings of forgotten Adepti, tortured\nfloorboards groaning under the boots of the mercenaries. Glokta lurched out into the\nwide dining hall.\nThe freak-show of Practicals was scattered about the dim chamber just as it had\nbeen when he last visited. The two identical men from Suljuk, with their curved\nswords. The tall, thin one, the dark men with their axes, the vast Northman with the\nruined face. And so on. A good score of them in all. Have they been sitting here all\nthis time, I wonder, just being menacing to each other?\nVitari was already up from her chair. 'I thought I told you to keep away from\nhere, cripple.'\n'I tried, indeed I did, but I could not banish the memory of your smile.'\n'Ho, ho, Shylo!' Cosca strolled out from the hallway, twiddling at the waxed ends\nof his moustache with one hand, sword drawn in the other.\n'Cosca! Don't you ever die?' Vitari let a cross-shaped knife tumble from her hand\nto clatter across the boards on the end of a long chain. 'Seems a day for men I\nhoped I'd seen the last of.' Her Practicals spread out around her, swords sliding\nfrom sheaths, axes, maces, spears scraping off the table. The mercenaries clomped"

The mercenaries clomped\ninto the hall, their own weapons at the ready. Glokta cleared his throat. 'I think it\nwould be better for all concerned if we could discuss this like civilised—'\n'You see anyone civilised?' snarled Vitari.\nA fair point. One Practical sprang up on the table making the cutlery jump. The\none-handed mercenary waved his hook in the air. The two heavily-armed groups\nedged towards each other. It looked very much as if Cosca and his hired hands\nwould be earning their pay. A merry bloodbath I daresay it will be, and the\noutcome of a bloodbath is notoriously hard to predict. All in all, I would rather not\ntake the gamble.\n'A shame about your children! A shame for them, that there's no one civilised\naround!'\nVitari's orange eyebrows drew furiously inwards. 'They're far away!'\n'Oh, I'm afraid not. Two girls and a boy? Beautiful, flaming red hair, just like their\nmother's?' Which gate would they go through? The Gurkish came from the west,\nso… 'They were stopped at the east gate, and taken into custody.' Glokta stuck out\nhis bottom lip. 'Protective custody. These are dangerous times for children to be\nwandering the streets, you know.'\nEven with her mask on Glokta could see her horror. 'When?' she hissed.\nWhen would a loving mother send her children to safety? 'Why, the very day the\nGurkish arrived, of course, you know that.' The way her eyes widened told him that\nhe had guessed right. Now to twist the blade. 'Don't worry though, they're tucked up\nsafe. Practical Severard is acting as nurse. But if I don't come back…'\n'You wouldn't hurt them.'\n'What is it with everyone today? Lines I won't cross? People I won't hurt?'\nGlokta showed his most revolting leer. 'Children? Hope, and prospects, and all that\nhappy life ahead of them? I despise the little bastards!' He shrugged his twisted\nshoulders. 'But perhaps you know me better. If you're keen to play dice with your\nchildren's lives, I suppose we can find out. Or we could reach an understanding, as\nwe did in Dagoska.'\n'Shit on this,' growled one of the Practicals, hefting his axe and taking a step\nforward. And the atmosphere of violence lurches another dizzy step towards the\nbrink…\nVitari shoved out her open hand. 'Don't move.'\n'You've got children, so what? Means nothing to me. It'll mean nothing to Sult\neeeeeee—' There was a flash of metal, the jingling of a chain, and the Practical\nstaggered forward, blood pouring from his opened throat.\nVitari's cross-shaped knife slapped back into her palm and her eyes flicked back\nto Glokta. 'An understanding?'\n'Exactly. You stay here. We go past. You didn't see nothing, as they say in the\nolder parts of town. You know well enough that you can't trust Sult. He left you to"

Time we tried something new, don't you think?'\nVitari's mask shifted as she worked her mouth. Thinking, thinking. The eyes of\nher killers sparkled, the blades of their weapons glinted. Don't call the bluff, bitch,\ndon't you dare…\n'Alright!' She gestured with her arm and the Practicals edged unhappily back, still\nglaring at the mercenaries across the room. Vitari nodded her spiky head towards a\ndoorway at the end of the chamber. 'Down that hall, down the stairs at the end, and\nthere's a door. A door with black iron rivets.'\n'Excellent.' A few words can be more effective than a lot of blades, even in such\ntimes as these. Glokta began to hobble away, Cosca and his men following.\nVitari frowned after them, her eyes deadly slits. 'If you so much as touch my—'\n'Yes, yes.' Glokta waved his hand. 'My terror is boundless.'\nThere was a moment of stillness, as the remains of the gutted building settled across\none side of the Square of Marshals. The Eaters stood, as shocked as Ferro, a circle\nof amazement. Bayaz appeared to be the only one not horrified by the scale of the\ndestruction. His harsh chuckling echoed out and bounced back from the walls. 'It\nworks!' he shouted.\n'No!' screamed Mamun, and the Hundred Words came rushing forward.\nCloser they came, the polished blades of their beautiful weapons flashing, their\nhungry mouths hanging open, their white teeth gleaming. Closer yet, streaming\ninwards with terrible speed, shrieking out a chorus of hate that made even Ferro's\nblood turn cold.\nBut Bayaz only laughed. 'Let the judgement begin!'\nFerro growled through clenched teeth as the Seed burned cold at her palm. A\nmighty blast of wind swept out across the square from its centre, sent Eaters\ntumbling like skittles, rolling and flailing. It shattered every window, ripped open\nevery door, stripped the roofs of every building bare.\nThe great inlaid gates of the Lords' Round were sucked open, then torn from\ntheir hinges, careering across the square. Tons of wood, spinning over and over like\nsheets of paper in a gale. They carved a crazy swathe through the helpless Eaters.\nThey ripped white-armoured bodies apart, sending parts of limbs flying, blood and\ndust going up in sprays and spatters.\nFerro's hand was shimmering, and half her forearm. She gasped quick breaths as\nthe cold spread through her veins, out to every part of her, burning at her insides.\nThe Seed blurred and trembled as if she looked at it through fast flowing water. The\nwind whipped at her eyes as white figures were flung through the air like toys,\nwrithing in a storm of shattered glass, shredded wood, splintered stone. No more"

No more\nthan a dozen of them kept their feet, reeling, clutching at the ground, shining hair\nstreaming from their heads, straining desperately against the blast.\nOne of them reached for Ferro, snarling into the wind. A woman, her glittering\nchain-mail thrashing, her hands clawing at the screaming air. She edged closer, and\ncloser. A smooth, proud face, stamped with contempt.\nLike the faces of the Eaters who had come for her near Dagoska. Like the faces\nof the slavers who had stolen her life from her. Like the face of Uthman-ul-Dosht,\nwho had smiled at her anger and her helplessness.\nFerro's shriek of fury merged with the shrieking of the wind. She had not known\nthat she could swing a sword so hard. The look of shock only just had time to form\non the Eater's perfect face before the curved blade sliced through her outstretched\narm and took her head from her shoulders. The corpse was plucked flopping away,\ndust flying from its gaping wounds.\nThe air was full of flashing shapes. Ferro stood frozen as debris whirred past her.\nA beam crashed through a struggling Eater's chest and carried it screaming away,\nhigh into the air, spitted like a locust on a skewer. Another burst suddenly apart in a\ncloud of blood and flesh, the remains sucked spiralling up into the trembling sky.\nThe great Eater with the beard struggled forward, lifting his huge club above his\nhead, bellowing words no one could hear. Through the pulsing, twisting air Ferro\nsaw Bayaz raise one eyebrow at him, saw his lips make one word.\n'Burn.'\nFor a single moment he blazed as brightly as a star, the image of him stamped\nwhite into Ferro's eyes. Then his blackened bones were snatched away into the\nstorm.\nOnly Mamun remained. He strained forwards, dragging his feet across the stone,\nacross the iron, inch by desperate inch towards Bayaz.\nOne armoured greave tore from his leg and flew back spinning through the\nmaddened air, then a plate from his shoulder followed it. Torn cloth flapped. The\nskin on his snarling face began to ripple and stretch.\n'No!' One clutching, clawing arm stretched desperately out towards the First of\nthe Magi, fingertips straining.\n'Yes,' said Bayaz, the air around his smiling face trembling like the air above the\ndesert. The nails tore from Mamun's fingers, his outstretched arm bent back,\nsnapped, was ripped from his shoulder. Flawless skin peeled from bone, flapping\nlike sailcloth in a squall, brown dust flying out of his torn body like a sandstorm over\nthe dunes.\nHe was dashed suddenly away, crashed through a wall near the top of one of the\ntall buildings. Blocks were sucked from the edges of the ragged hole he left and\ntumbled outwards, upwards.

It reached now as high as the tall buildings, and now higher yet. It flayed and\nscoured at everything it passed, tearing up more stone, glass, wood, metal, flesh,\ngrowing darker, faster, louder and more powerful with every moment.\nOver the mindless anger of the wind Ferro could just hear Bayaz' voice.\n'God smiles on results.'\nDogman got up, and shook his sore head, dirt flying from his hair. There was blood\nrunning down his arm, red on white. Seemed as if the world hadn't ended after all.\nLooked like it had come close, though.\nBridge and gatehouse both had disappeared. Where they'd stood there was\nnothing but a great heap of broken stone and a yawning chasm carved out of the\nwalls. That and a whole lot of dust. There were still some folk killing, but there were\na lot more rolling about, choking and groaning, staggering through the rubbish, the\nfight all gone out of 'em. Dogman knew how they felt.\nSomeone was clambering up onto that mass of junk where the moat used to be,\nheading towards the breach. Someone with a tangled mess of hair and a long sword\nin one hand.\nWho else but Logen Ninefingers?\n'Ah, shit,' cursed Dogman. He'd got some damn fool ideas all of a sudden, had\nLogen, but that wasn't halfway the worst of it. There was someone following him\nacross that bridge of rubble. Shivers, axe in hand, shield on arm, and a frown on his\ndirty face like a man with some dark work in mind.\n'Ah, shit!'\nGrim shrugged his dusty shoulders. 'Best get after 'em.'\n'Aye.' Dogman jerked his thumb at Red Hat, just getting up from the ground and\nshaking a pile of grit off his coat. 'Get some lads together, eh?' He pointed off\ntowards the breach with the blade of his sword. 'We're going that way.'\nDamn it but he needed to piss, just like always.\nJezal backed away down the shadowy hall, hardly daring even to breathe, feeling the\nsweat prickle at his palms, at his neck, at the small of his back.\n'What are they waiting for?' someone muttered.\nThere was a gentle creaking sound above.

Antique swords tumbled from their\nbrackets and clattered down into the hallway around his limp corpse.\n'This way!' The High Justice dragged Jezal, numb and helpless, towards a pair of\ngilded double doors. Gorst lifted up one heavy boot, gave them a shivering kick and\nsent them flying open. They burst through into the Chamber of Mirrors, cleared of\nthe many tables that had stood there on Jezal's wedding night, an empty acre of\npolished tiles.\nHe ran for the far door, his slapping footfalls and his heaving, wheezing, horrified\nbreath echoing out around the huge room. He saw himself running, distorted, in the\nmirrors far ahead of him, the mirrors to each side. A ludicrous sight. A clown-king,\nfleeing though his own palace, crown askew, his scarred face beaded with sweat,\nslack with terror and exhaustion. He skidded to a halt, almost fell over backwards in\nhis haste to stop, Gorst nearly ploughing into his back.\nOne of the twins was sitting on the floor beside the far doorway, leaning back\nagainst the mirrored wall, reflected in it, as though she were leaning against her sister.\nShe lifted up one languorous hand, daubed crimson with blood, and she waved.\nJezal spun towards the windows.

He saw bodies scattered on the lawns. Some armoured, some\nnot. He could hear a distant roar—far-off battle, maybe. Nothing nearer except the\nhissing of the wind through the bare branches and the crunching of his own\nfootsteps in the gravel. His skin prickled as he crept towards the high wall of the\npalace.\nThe heavy doors were gone, only the twisted hinges left hanging in the archway.\nThe gardens on the other side were full of corpses.

A wind had blown up in the gardens, and his black hair flicked\naround his face, dark skin smooth and flawless as a baby's. He was frowning down\nat a body near his feet, but he looked up at Logen as he came through the gate.\nWithout hatred or fear, without happiness or sadness. Without anything much.\n'You are a long way from home,' he said, in Northern.\n'You too.' Logen looked into that empty face. 'You an Eater?'\n'To that crime I must confess.'\n'We're all guilty o' something.' Logen hefted his sword in one hand. 'Shall we get\nto it, then?'\n'I came here to kill Bayaz. No one else.'\nLogen glanced round at the ruined corpses scattered across the gardens. 'How's\nthat working out for you?'\n'Once you set your mind on killing, it is hard to choose the number of the dead.'\n'That is a fact. Blood gets you nothing but more blood, my father used to tell\nme.'\n'A wise man.'\n'If only I'd listened.'\n'It is hard, sometimes, to know what is… the truth.' The Eater lifted up his\nbloody right hand and frowned at it. 'It is fitting that a righteous man should have…\ndoubts.'\n'You tell me. Can't say I know too many righteous men.'\n'I once thought I did. Now I am not sure. We must fight?'\nLogen took a long breath. 'Looks that way.'\n'So be it.'\nHe came so fast there was hardly time to lift a sword, let alone swing it. Logen\nthrew himself out of the way but still got caught in the ribs with something—elbow,\nknee, shoulder. It can be hard to tell when you're flopping over and over on the\ngrass, everything tumbling around you. He tried to get up, found that he couldn't.\nRaising his head an inch was almost more than he could manage. Every breath was\npainful. He dropped back, staring up at the white sky. Maybe he should've stayed\noutside the walls. Maybe he should've just let the lads rest in the trees, until after it\nwas all settled.\nThe tall shape of the Eater swam into his blurry vision, black against the clouds. 'I\nam sorry for this. I will pray for you. I will pray for us both.' He lifted up his\narmoured foot.\nAn axe chopped into his face and sent him staggering. Logen shook the light out\nof his head, dragged some air in. He forced himself up onto one elbow, clutching at\nhis side. He saw a white-armoured fist flash down and crash onto Shivers' shield. It\nripped a chunk out of the edge and knocked Shivers onto his knees. An arrow\npinged off the Eater's shoulder-plate and he turned, one side of his head hanging\nbloodily open. A second shaft stuck him neatly through the neck. Grim and the\nDogman stood in the archway, their bows raised.\nThe Eater went pounding towards them with huge strides, the wind of his passing\ntearing at the grass."

More Northmen charged through the gate, crowding\nround, screaming and shouting, hacking with axes and swords.\nLogen rolled over, crawled across the lawn and seized hold of his sword, tearing\na wet handful of grass up with it. A Carl tumbled past him, broken head covered in\nblood. Logen squeezed his jaws together and charged, lifting his sword in both\nhands.\nIt bit into the Eater's shoulder, sheared through his armour and split him open\ndown as far as his chest, showering blood in the Dogman's face.

He was smiling, so far as Logen could\ntell with half his face hanging off. 'Free,' he whispered.\nLogen raised the Maker's blade and hacked his head from his shoulders.\nA wind had blown up suddenly, swirling through the stained streets, hissing out of\nthe burned-out buildings, whipping ash and dust in West's face as he rode towards\nthe Agriont. He had to shout over it. 'How do we fare?'\n'The fight's gone out of 'em!' bellowed Brint, his hair dragged sideways by\nanother gust. 'They're in full retreat! Seems as if they were too keen to get the\nAgriont surrounded and they weren't ready for us! Now they're falling over each\nother to get away to the west.

Or, more accurately, where\nthe west gate had once been.\nIt took him a moment to make sense of it. The Tower of Chains loomed up to\none side of a monumental breach in the wall of the Agriont. The entire gatehouse had\nsomehow been brought down, along with large sections of the wall to either side, the\nremains choking the moat below or distributed widely around the ruined streets in\nfront.\nThe Gurkish were inside the Agriont.

He saw a line of kneeling flatbow-men deliver a withering volley\ninto a crowd of Gurkish, bodies toppling. Beside him a man screamed into the wind\nas another tried to secure a tourniquet on the bloody stump of his leg.\nPike's face was grimmer even than usual. 'We should be further back, sir. This\nisn't safe.'\nWest ignored him. Each man had to do his part, without exception.\n'We need a line formed up here! Where is General Kroy?' The Sergeant was no\nlonger listening. His eyes had drifted upwards, his mouth dropping stupidly open.\nWest turned around in his saddle.\nA black column was rising above the western end of the citadel. It seemed at first\nto be made of swirling smoke, but as West gained some sense of scale he realised it\nwas spinning matter. Masses of it. Countless tons of it. His eyes followed it\nupwards, higher and higher. The clouds themselves were moving, whipped round in\na spiral at the centre, shifting in a slow circle above them. The fighting sputtered, as\nUnion and Gurkish alike gaped up at the writhing pillar above the Agriont, the Tower\nof Chains a black finger in front of it, the House of the Maker an insignificant\npin-prick behind.\nThings began to rain from the sky. Small things, at first— splinters, dust, leaves,\nfragments of paper. Then a chunk of wood the size of a chair leg plummeted down\nand bounced spinning from the paving. A soldier squealed as a stone big as a fist\nsmashed into his shoulder. Those who were not fighting were backing away,\ncrouching to the ground, holding shields above their heads. The wind was growing\nmore savage, clothes whipping in the storm, men stumbling against it, leaning into it,\nteeth gritted and eyes narrowed. The spinning pillar was growing wider, darker,\nfaster, higher, touching the very sky. West could see specks around its edge dancing\nagainst the white clouds like swarms of midges on a summer's day.\nExcept that these were tumbling blocks of stone, wood, earth, metal, by some\nfreak of nature sucked into the heavens and set flying. He did not know what was\nhappening, or how. All he could do was stare.\n'Sir!' bellowed Pike in his ear. 'Sir, we must go!' He seized hold of West's bridle.\nA great chunk of masonry crashed into the paving not far from them. West's horse\nreared up, screaming in panic. The world lurched, spun, was black, he was not sure\nhow long for.\nHe was on his face, mouth full of grit. He raised his head, wobbled drunkenly up\nto his hands and knees, wind roaring in his ears, flying grit stinging at his face. It was\ndark as dusk. The air was full of tumbling rubbish. It ripped at the ground, at the\nbuildings, at the men, huddled now like sheep, all thoughts of battle long forgotten,\nthe living sprawled on their faces with the dead.

The Tower of Chains was scoured\nby debris, the slates flying from its rafters, then the rafters torn away into the storm.\nA giant beam plummeted down and crashed into the cobbles, spun end over end,\nflinging corpses out of its path to slice through the wall of a house and send its roof\nsliding inwards.\nWest trembled, tears snatched away from his stinging eyes, utterly helpless. Was\nthis how the end would come? Not covered in blood and glory at the head of a\nfool's charge like General Poulder. Not passing quietly in the night like Marshal Burr.\nNot even hooded on the scaffold for the murder of Crown Prince Ladisla.\nCrushed at random by a giant piece of rubbish falling from the sky.\n'Forgive me,' he whispered into the tempest.\nHe saw the black outline of the Tower of Chains shifting. He saw it lean\noutwards. Chunks of stone rained down, splashed into the churning moat. The\nwhole vast edifice lurched, bulged, and toppled outwards, with ludicrous slowness,\nthrough the flailing storm and into the city.\nIt broke into monstrous sections as it fell, crashing down upon the houses,\ncrushing cowering men like ants, throwing deadly missiles in every direction.\nAnd that was all.\nThere were no buildings, now, around the space that had once been the Square of\nMarshals. The gushing fountains, the stately statues in the Kingsway, the palaces full\nof soft pinks.\nAll snatched away.\nThe gilded dome had lifted from the Lords' Round, cracked, split, and been\nripped into chaff. The high wall of the Halls Martial was a ravaged ruin. The rest of\nthe proud buildings were nothing more than shattered stumps, torn down to their\nvery foundations. They had all melted away before Ferro's watering eyes. Dissolved\ninto the formless mass of fury that whirled shrieking around the First of the Magi,\nendlessly hungry from the ground to the very heavens.\n'Yes!' She could hear his delighted laughter, over the noise of the storm. 'I am\ngreater than Juvens! I am greater than Euz himself!'\nWas this vengeance? Then how much of it would make her whole? Ferro\nwondered dumbly how many people had been cowering in those vanished buildings.\nThe shimmering around the Seed was swelling, up to her shoulder, then to her neck,\nand it engulfed her.\nThe world grew quiet.\nFar away the destruction continued, but it was blurred now, the sounds of it\ncame to her muffled, as if through water. Her hand was beyond cold. She was numb\nto the shoulder. She saw Bayaz, smiling, his arms raised. The wind ripped about\nthem, a wall of endless movement.\nBut there were shapes within it.\nThey grew sharper even as the rest of the world grew less distinct.

The light had faded, then stuff had started tumbling down from the\ndark sky. Dogman didn't know where it was coming from and he didn't much care.\nHe had other things more pressing to worry on.\nThey dragged the wounded in through a high doorway, groaning, cursing, or\nworst of all, saying nothing. A couple they left outside, back to the mud already. No\npoint wasting breath on them who were far past helping.\nLogen had Grim under his armpits, the Dogman had him by the boots. His face\nwas white as chalk but for the red blood on his lips. You could see it plain on his\nface that it was bad, but he didn't complain any, not Harding Grim. Dogman\nwouldn't have believed it if he had.\nThey set him down on the floor, in the gloom on the other side of the door.\nDogman could hear things rattling against the windows, thumping against the turf\noutside, clattering on the roofs above. More men were carried in—broken arms and\nbroken legs and worse besides. Shivers came after, bloody axe in one hand and his\nshield-arm dangling useless.\nDogman had never seen a hallway like it. The floor was made of green stone and\nwhite stone, polished up smooth and shining bright as glass. The walls were hung\nwith great paintings. The ceiling was crusted with flowers and leaves, carved so fine\nthey looked almost real, except that they were made from gold, glittering in the dim\nlight leaking through the windows.\nMen bent down, tending to fellows injured, giving them water and soft words, a\nsplint or two being fixed. Logen and Shivers just stood there, giving each other a\nlook. Not hatred, exactly, and not respect. It was hard for the Dogman to say what it\nwas, and he didn't much care about that either.\n'What were you thinking?' he snapped. 'Pissing off on your own like that?\nThought you were supposed to be chief, now! That's a poor effort, ain't it?'\nLogen only stared back, eyes gleaming in the gloom. 'Got to help Ferro,' he\nmuttered, half to himself. 'Jezal too.'\nDogman stared at him. 'Got to help who? There's real folk here in need o' help.'\n'I ain't much with the wounded.'\n'Only with the making of 'em! Go on then, Bloody-Nine, if you must. Get to it.'\nDogman saw Logen's face flinch when he heard that name. He backed away, one\nhand clamped to his side and his sword gripped bloody in the other. Then he turned\nand limped off down the glittering hallway.\n'Hurts,' said Grim, as Dogman squatted down next to him.\n'Where?'\nHe gave a bloody smile. 'Everywhere.'\n'Right, well…' Dogman pulled his shirt up. One side of his chest was caved in, a\ngreat blue-black bruise spread out all across it like a tar-stain. He could hardly\nbelieve a man could still be breathing with a wound like that. 'Ah…' he muttered, not\nhaving a clue where to start even."

Dogman tried to grin but didn't have it in him. 'No more'n a scratch.'\n'Scratch, eh?' Grim tried to lift his head, winced and fell back, breathing shallow.\nHe stared up, eyes wide open. 'That's a fucking beautiful ceiling.'\nThe Dogman swallowed. 'Aye. I reckon.'\n'Should've died fighting Ninefingers, long time ago. The rest was all a gift.\nGrateful for it, though, Dogman. I've always loved… our talks.'\nHe closed his eyes, and he stopped breathing. He'd never said much, Harding\nGrim. Famous for it. Now he'd stay silent forever. A pointless sort of a death, a long\nway from home. Not for anything he'd believed in, or understood, or stood to gain\nfrom. Nothing more'n a waste. But then Dogman had seen a lot of men go back to\nthe mud, and there was never anything fine about it. He took a long breath, and\nstared down at the floor.\nA single lamp cast creeping shadows across the mouldering hallway, over rough\nstone and flaking plaster. It made sinister outlines of the mercenaries, turned Cosca's\nface and Ardee's into unfamiliar masks. The darkness seemed to gather inside the\nheavy stonework of the archway and around the door within— ancient-looking,\nknotted and grained, studded with black iron rivets.\n'Something amusing, Superior?'\n'I stood here,' murmured Glokta. 'In this exact spot. With Silber.' He reached out\nand brushed the iron handle with his fingertips. 'My hand was on the latch… and I\nmoved on.' Ah, the irony. The answers we seek so long and far for—so often at our\nfingertips all along.\nGlokta felt a shiver down his twisted spine as he leaned close to the door. He\ncould hear something from beyond, a muffled droning in a language he did not\nrecognise. The Adeptus Demonic calls upon the denizens of the abyss? He licked\nhis lips, the image of High Justice Marovia's frozen remains fresh in his mind. It\nwould be rash to plunge straight through, however keen we are to put our\nquestions to rest. Very rash…\n'Superior Goyle, since you have led us here, perhaps you would care to go first?'\n'Geegh?' squeaked Goyle through his gag, his already bulging eyes going even\nwider. Cosca took the Superior of Adua by his collar, seized the iron handle with his\nother hand, thrust it swiftly open and applied his boot to the seat of Goyle's\ntrousers. He stumbled through, bellowing meaningless nonsense into his gag. The\nmetallic sound of a flatbow being discharged issued from the other side of the door,\nalong with the chanting, louder and harsher now by far.\nWhat would Colonel Glokta have said? Onwards to victory, lads! Glokta\nlurched through the doorway, almost tripping over his own aching foot on the\nthreshold, and gazed about him in surprise. A large, circular hall with a domed"

A large, circular hall with a domed\nceiling, its shadowy walls painted with a vast, exquisitely detailed mural. And one\nthat seems uncomfortably familiar. Kanedias, the Master Maker, loomed up over\nthe chamber with arms outspread, five times life-size or more, fire blazing from\nbehind him in vivid crimson, orange, white. On the opposite wall lay his brother\nJuvens, stretched out on the grass beneath flowering trees, blood running from his\nmany wounds. In between the two men, the Magi marched to take their revenge, six\non one side, five on the other, bald Bayaz in the lead. Blood, fire, death, vengeance.\nHow wonderfully appropriate, given the circumstances.\nAn intricate design had been laid out with obsessive care, covering wide floor.\nCircles within circles, shapes, symbols, figures of frightening complexity, all\ndescribed in neat lines of white powder. Salt, unless I am much mistaken. Goyle lay\non his chest a stride or two from the door, at the edge of the outermost ring, his\nhands still tied behind him. Dark blood spread out from under him, the point of a\nflatbow bolt sticking out of his back. Just where his heart should be. I would never\nhave taken that for his weak spot.\nFour of the University's Adepti stood in various stages of amazement. Three of\nthem: Chayle, Denka, and Kandelau, held candles in both hands, their sputtering\nwicks giving off a choking corpse-stink. Saurizin, the Adeptus Chemical, clutched an\nempty flatbow. The faces of the old men, lit in bilious yellow from beneath, were\npantomime masks of fear.\nAt the far side of the room Silber stood behind a lectern, a great book open\nbefore him, staring down with intense concentration by the light of a single lamp. His\nfinger hissed across the page, his thin lips moving ceaselessly. Even at this distance,\nand despite the fact the room was icy cold, Glokta could see fat beads of sweat\nrunning down his thin face. Beside him, painfully upright in his pure white coat and\nglaring blue daggers across the width of the chamber, stood Arch Lector Sult.\n'Glokta, you crippled bastard!' he snarled, 'what the hell are you doing here?'\n'I could well ask you the same question, your Eminence.' He waved his cane at\nthe scene. 'Except the candles, the ancient books, the chanting and the circles of salt\nrather give the game away, no?' And a rather infantile game it seems, suddenly. All\nthat time, while I was torturing my way through the Mercers, while I was risking\nmy life in Dagoska, while I was blackmailing votes in your name, you were up\nto… this?\nBut Sult seemed to be taking it seriously enough. 'Get out, you fool! This is our\nlast chance!'\n'This? Seriously?' Cosca was already through the door, masked mercenaries\nfollowing. Silber's eyes were still fixed on the book, lips still moving, more sweat on\nhis face than ever. Glokta frowned. 'Someone shut him up.'"

'Someone shut him up.'\n'No!' shouted Chayle, a look of utter horror on his tiny face. 'You mustn't stop\nthe incantations! It is a profoundly dangerous operation! The consequences could\nbe… could be—'\n'Disastrous!' shrieked Kandelau. One of the mercenaries took a step towards the\nmiddle of the room nonetheless.\n'Don't tread near the salt!' screeched Denka, wax dripping from his wobbling\ncandle. 'Whatever you do!'\n'Wait!' snapped Glokta, and the man paused at the edge of the circle, peering at\nhim over his mask. The room was growing colder even as they spoke. Unnaturally\ncold. Something was happening in the centre of the circles. The air was trembling,\nlike the air above a bonfire, more and more as Silber's harsh voice droned on.\nGlokta stood frozen, his eyes flicking between the old Adepti. What to do? Stop\nhim, or don't stop him? Stop him, or—\n'Allow me!' Cosca stepped forwards, delving into his black coat with his spare\nleft hand. But you can't be— He whipped his arm out with a careless flourish and\nhis throwing knife came with it. The blade flashed in the candlelight, spun directly\nthrough the shimmering air in the centre of the room, and imbedded itself to the hilt\nin Silber's forehead with a gentle thud.\n'Ha!' Cosca seized Glokta by the shoulder. 'What did I tell you? Have you ever\nseen a knife thrown better?'\nBlood ran down the side of Silber's face in a red trickle. His eyes rolled upwards,\nflickered, then he sagged sideways, dragging over his lectern, and crashed to the\nfloor. His book tumbled down on top of him, aged pages flapping, the lamp spilled\nover and sprayed streaks of burning oil across the floor.\n'No!' shrieked Sult.\nChayle gasped, his mouth falling open. Kandelau threw his candle aside and sank\ngrovelling to the floor. Denka gave a terrified squeak, one hand over his face, staring\nout pop-eyed from between his fingers. There was a long pause while everyone\nexcept Cosca stared, horrified, towards the corpse of the Adeptus Demonic. Glokta\nwaited, his few teeth bared, his eyes almost squeezed shut. Like that horrible,\nbeautiful moment between stubbing your toe and feeling the hurt. Here it comes.\nHere it comes.\nHere comes the pain…\nBut nothing came. No demonic laughter echoed through the chamber. The floor\ndid not fall in to expose a gate to hell. The shimmering faded, the room began to\ngrow warmer. Glokta raised his brows, almost disappointed. 'It would seem the\ndiabolical arts are decidedly overrated.'\n'No!' snarled Sult again.\n'I am afraid so, your Eminence. And to think I used to respect you.' Glokta\ngrinned at the Adeptus Chemical, still clinging weakly to his empty flatbow. He\nwaved a hand at Goyle's body. 'A good shot. I congratulate you.

He waved a finger at the crowd of mercenaries behind him. 'Now\nseize that man.'\n'No!' bellowed Saurizin, throwing his flatbow to the floor. 'None of it was my\nidea! I had no choice! It was him!' He stabbed a thick finger at Silber's lifeless body.\n'And… and him!' He pointed to Sult with a trembling arm.\n'You've got the right idea, but it can wait for the interrogation. Would you be kind\nenough to take his Eminence into custody?'\n'Happily.' Cosca strolled across the floor of the wide room, his boots sending up\npuffs of white powder, leaving a trail of ruination through the intricate patterns.\n'Glokta, you blundering idiot!' shrieked Sult. 'You have no idea of the danger\nBayaz poses! This First of the Magi and his bastard king! Glokta! You have no\nright! Gah!' He yelped as Cosca dragged his arms behind his back and forced him to\nhis knees, his white hair in disarray. 'You have no idea—'\n'If the Gurkish don't kill the lot of us, you'll get ample time to explain it to me. Of\nthat I assure you.' Glokta leered his toothless smile as Cosca drew the rope tight\naround Sult's wrists. If you only knew how long I have dreamed of saying these\nwords. 'Arch Lector Sult. I arrest you for high treason against his Majesty the King.'\nJezal could only stand and stare. One of the twins, the one spattered in blood, lifted\nher long arms slowly over her head and gave a long, satisfied stretch. The other\nraised an eyebrow.\n'How would you like to die?' she asked.\n'Your Majesty, get behind me.' Gorst hefted his long steel in his one good hand.\n'No. Not this time.' Jezal pulled the crown from his head, the crown that Bayaz\nhad been so particular in designing, and tossed it clattering away. He was done with\nbeing a king. If he was to die, he would die a man, like any other. He had been given\nso many advantages, he realised now. Far more than most men could ever dream of.\nSo many chances to do good, and he had done nothing besides whine and think of\nhimself. Now it was too late. 'I've lived my life leaning on others. Hiding behind\nthem. Climbing on their shoulders. Not this time.'\nOne of the twins raised her hands and started slowly to clap, the regular tap, tap,\nechoing from the mirrors. The other giggled. Gorst raised his sword. Jezal did the\nsame, one last act of pointless defiance.\nThen High Justice Marovia flashed between them. The old man moved with\nimpossible speed, his dark robe snapping around him. He had something in his\nhand. A long rod of dark metal with a hook on the end.\n'What—' muttered Jezal.\nThe hook blazed suddenly, searingly white, bright as the sun on a summer's day."

A long rod of dark metal with a hook on the end.\n'What—' muttered Jezal.\nThe hook blazed suddenly, searingly white, bright as the sun on a summer's day.\nA hundred hooks burned like stars, reflected back from the mirrors round the walls,\nand back, and back, into the far distance. Jezal gasped, squeezed his eyes shut,\nholding one hand over his face, the long trail left by that brilliant point burned fizzing\ninto his vision.\nHe blinked, gaped, lowered his arm. The twins stood, the High Justice beside\nthem, just where they had before, still as statues. Tendrils of white steam hissed up\nfrom vents in the end of the strange weapon and curled around Marovia's arm. For a\nmoment, nothing moved.\nThen a dozen of the great mirrors at the far end of the hall fell in half across the\nmiddle, as though they were sheets of paper slashed suddenly by the world's\nsharpest knife. A couple of the bottom halves and one of the top toppled slowly\nforwards into the room and shattered, scattering bright fragments of glass across the\ntiled floor.\n'Urgggh,' breathed the twin on the left. Jezal realised that blood was spurting out\nfrom under her armour. She lifted one hand towards him and it dropped off the end\nof her arm and thudded to the tiles, blood squirting from the smoothly severed\nstump. She toppled to the left. Or her body did, at least. Her legs fell the other way.\nThe bigger part of her crashed to the ground, and her head came off and rolled\nacross the tiles in a widening pool. Her hair, trimmed off cleanly at the neck, fluttered\ndown into the bloody mess in a golden cloud.\nArmour, flesh, bone, all divided into neat sections as perfectly as cheese by a\ncheese wire. The twin on the right frowned, took a wobbling step towards Marovia.\nHer knees gave out and she fell in half at the waist. The legs slumped down and lay\nstill, dust sliding out in a brown heap. The top half dragged itself forward by the\nnails, lifted its head, hissing.\nThe air around the High Justice shimmered and the Eater's severed body burst\ninto flames. It thrashed, for a while, making a long squealing sound. Then it was still,\na mass of smoking black ash.\nMarovia lifted up the strange weapon, whistling softly as he smiled at the hook on\nthe end, a last few traces of vapour still drifting from it. 'Kanedias. He certainly knew\nhow to make a weapon. The Master Maker indeed, eh, your Majesty?'\n'What?' muttered Jezal, utterly dumbfounded.\nMarovia's face melted slowly away as he crossed the floor towards them.\nAnother began to show itself beneath. Only his eyes remained the same.\nDifferent-coloured eyes, happy lines around the corners, grinning at Jezal like an old\nfriend.\nYoru Sulfur bowed. 'Never any peace, eh, your Majesty? Never the slightest\npeace.'\nThere was a crash as one of the doors burst open. Jezal raised his sword, heart in\nhis mouth. Sulfur whipped round, the Maker's weapon held down by his side. A"

A\nman stumbled into the room.

How the hell did you\nget here?'\nThe Northman stared for a moment. Then he leaned back against a mirror by the\ndoor, let his sword drop to the tiles. He slid down, slowly, until he hit the floor, and\nsat there with his head leaning back against the glass. 'Long story,' he said.\n'Listen to us…'\nThe wind was full of shapes, now. Hundreds of them.

Voices she knew and had forgotten. Voices\nof the dead and of the living. Shouts, mutters, screams. Whispers, in her ear. Closer\nstill. Closer than her own thoughts.\n'You want vengeance?'\n'We can give you vengeance.'\n'Like nothing you have dreamed of.'\n'All you want. All you need.'\n'Only let us in…'\n'That empty space in you?'\n'We are what is missing!'\nThe metal rings had turned white with frost. Ferro kneeled at one end of a\ndizzying tunnel, its walls made from rushing, roaring, furious matter, full of shadows,\nits end far beyond the dark sky. The laughter of the First of the Magi echoed faintly\nin her ears. The air hummed with power, twisted, shimmered, blurred.\n'You need do nothing.'\n'Bayaz.'\n'He will do it.'\n'Fool!'\n'Liar!'\n'Let us in…'\n'He cannot understand.'\n'He uses you!'\n'He laughs.'\n'But not for long.'\n'The gates strain.'\n'Let us in…'\nIf Bayaz heard the voices he gave no sign. Cracks ran through the quivering\npaving, branching out from his feet, splinters floating up around him in whirling\nspirals. The iron rings began to shift, to buckle. With a grinding of tortured metal\nthey twisted out from the crumbling stones, bright edges shining.\n'The seals break.'\n'Eleven wards.'\n'And eleven wards reversed.'\n'The doors open.'\n'Yes,' came the voices, speaking together.\nThe shadows crowded in closer. Ferro's breath came short and fast, her teeth\nrattled, her limbs trembled, the cold was on her very heart. She knelt at a precipice,\nbottomless, limitless, full of shadows, full of voices.\n'Soon we will be with you.'\n'Very soon.'"

She wedged her tongue\nbetween her teeth and bit down hard, felt her mouth fill up with salty blood. She\nsucked in breath, forced her eyes open.\n'Trust us…'\n'Let us in!'\nShe saw the Maker's box, a shifting, swimming outline. She bent down over it,\ndigging at it with her numb fingertips while the air lashed at her. She would be no\none's slave. Not for Bayaz, not for the Tellers of Secrets. She would find her own\npath. A dark one, perhaps, but her own.\nThe lid swung open.\n'No.' The voices hissed together in her ear.\n'No!'\nFerro ground her bloody teeth, growled with fury as she forced her fingers to\nunclench. The world was a melting, screaming, formless mass of darkness.\nGradually, gradually, her dead hand came open. Here was her revenge. Against the\nliars, the users, the thieves. The earth shook, crumbled, tore, as thin and fragile as a\nsheet of glass, and with an empty void beneath it. She turned her trembling hand and\nthe Seed dropped from her palm.\nAll as one, the voices screamed their harsh command. 'No!'\nShe blindly seized hold of the lid. 'Fuck yourselves!' she hissed.\nAnd with her last grain of strength she forced the box closed.\nAfter the Rains\n« ^ »\nLogen leaned on the parapet, high up on a tower at one side of the palace, and\nfrowned into the wind.

Further\nwest, and they had no roofs, bare rafters hanging. Further still their walls were torn\nand scoured, empty shells, choked with rubble.\nBeyond that, there was nothing. The great hall with the golden dome, gone. The\nsquare where Logen had watched the sword-game, gone. The Tower of Chains, the\nmighty wall under it, and all the grand buildings over which Logen had fled with\nFerro. All gone.\nA colossal circle of destruction was carved from the western end of the Agriont,\nand only acres of formless wreckage remained. The city beyond was torn with black\nscars, smoke still rising from a few last fires, from smouldering hulks still drifting in\nthe bay. The House of the Maker loomed over the scene, a sharp black mass under\nthe brooding clouds, uncaring and untouched.\nLogen stood there, scratching at the scarred side of his face, over and over. His\nwounds ached. So many of them. Every part of him was battered and bruised,\nslashed and torn. From the fight with the Eater, from the battle beyond the moat,\nfrom the duel with the Feared, from seven days of slaughter in the High Places.\nFrom a hundred fights, and skirmishes, and old campaigns. Too many to remember.\nSo tired, and sore, and sick.\nHe frowned down at his hands on the parapet in front of him. The bare stone\nlooked back where his middle finger used to be. He was Ninefingers still. The\nBloody-Nine. A man made of death, just as Bethod had said. He'd nearly killed the\nDogman yesterday, he knew it. His oldest friend. His only friend. He'd raised the\nsword, and if it wasn't for a trick of fate, he would have done it.\nHe remembered standing high up, on the side of the Great Northern library,\nlooking out over the empty valley, the still lake like a great mirror beneath it. He\nremembered feeling the wind on his fresh-shaved jaw, and wondering whether a man\ncould change.\nNow he knew the answer.\n'Master Ninefingers!'\nLogen turned quickly, hissed through his teeth as the stitches down his side\nburned. The First of the Magi stepped through the doorway and out into the open\nair. He was changed, somehow. He looked young. Younger even than when Logen\nfirst met him. There was a sharpness to his movements, a gleam in his eye. It even\nseemed that there were a few dark hairs in the grey beard round his friendly grin. The\nfirst smile Logen had seen in a good while.\n'You are hurt?' he asked.\nLogen sucked sourly at his teeth. 'Hardly the first time.'\n'And yet it gets no easier.' Bayaz placed his meaty fists on the stone next to\nLogen's and stared out happily at the view. Just as if it was a field of flowers instead\nof a sweep of epic ruin. 'I hardly expected to see you again so soon. And to see you\nso very far advanced. I understand that your feud is over. You defeated Bethod."

You defeated Bethod.\nThrew him from his own walls, the way I heard it. A nice touch. Always thinking of\nthe song they will sing, eh? And then you took his place. The Bloody-Nine, King of\nthe Northmen! Imagine that.'\nLogen frowned. 'That wasn't how it happened.'\n'Details. The result is the same, is it not? Peace in the North, at last? Either way, I\ncongratulate you.'\n'Bethod had a few things to say.'\n'Did he?' asked Bayaz, carelessly. 'I always found his conversation rather drab.\nAll about himself, his plans, his achievements. It is so very tiresome when men think\nnever of others. Poor manners.'\n'He said you're the reason why he didn't kill me. That you bargained for my life.'\n'True, I must confess. He owed me, and you were the price I demanded. I like to\nkeep one eye on the future. Even then, I knew I might have need of a man who could\nspeak to the spirits. It was an unexpected bonus that you turned out to be such a\nwinning travelling companion.'\nLogen found he was talking through gritted teeth. 'Would have been nice to know\nis all.'\n'You never asked, Master Ninefingers. You did not want to know my plans, as I\nrecall, and I did not want to make you feel indebted. \"I saved your life once\" would\nhave been a poor start to our friendship.'\nAll reasonable enough, like everything Bayaz ever said, but it left a sour taste still,\nto have been traded like a hog. 'Where's Quai? I'd like to—'\n'Dead.' Bayaz pronounced the word smartly, sharp as a knife thrust. 'We feel his\nloss most keenly.'\n'Back to the mud, eh?' Logen remembered the effort he'd made to save that man's\nlife. The miles he'd slogged through the rain, trying to do the right thing. All wasted.\nPerhaps he should've felt more. But it was hard with so much death spread out in\nfront of him. Logen was numb, now. Either that, or he really didn't care a shit. It was\nhard to say which.\n'Back to the mud,' he muttered again. 'You carry on, though, don't you.'\n'Of course.'\n'That's the task that comes with surviving. You remember them, you say some\nwords, then you carry on, and hope for better.'\n'Indeed.'\n'You have to be realistic about these things.'\n'True.'\nLogen worked at his sore side with one hand, trying to make himself feel\nsomething. But a scrap of extra pain helped no one. 'I lost a friend yesterday.'\n'It was a bloody day. But a victorious one.'\n'Oh aye? For who?' He could see people moving among the ruins, insects picking\nat the rubble, searching for survivors and finding the dead. He doubted many of\nthem were feeling the flush of victory right now. He knew he wasn't. 'I should be\nwith my own kind,' he muttered, but without moving. 'Helping with the burying."

Healing\nis for the young. As one gets older, one finds one has less and less patience with the\nwounded.' He raised his eyebrows as he turned back towards the horrible view. 'I\nam very old.'\nHe lifted his fist to knock, then paused, fingers rubbing nervously against his palm.\nHe remembered the sour-sweet smell of her, the strength of her hands, the shape\nof her frown in the firelight. He remembered the warmth of her, pressed up close to\nhim in the night. He knew there had been something good between them, even if all\nthe words they had said had been hard. Some people don't have soft words in them,\nhowever much they try. He didn't hold much hope, of course. A man like him was\nbetter off without it. But you get nothing out if you put nothing in.\nSo Logen gritted his teeth and knocked. No reply. He chewed at his lip, and\nknocked again. Nothing. He frowned, twitchy and suddenly out of patience,\nwrenched the knob round and shoved the door open.\nFerro spun about. Her clothes were rumpled and dirty, even more than usual. Her\neyes were wide, wild even, her fists clenched. But her face quickly fell when she saw\nit was him, and his heart sank with it.\n'It's me, Logen.'\n'Uh,' she grunted. She jerked her head sideways, frowning at the window. She\ntook a couple of steps towards it, eyes narrowed. Then she snapped round suddenly\nthe other way. 'There!'\n'What?' muttered Logen, baffled.\n'Do you not hear them?'\n'Hear what?'\n'Them, idiot!' She crept over to one wall and pressed herself up against it.\nLogen hadn't been sure how it would go. You could never be sure of anything\nwith her, he knew that. But he hadn't been expecting this. Just plough ahead, he\nreckoned. What else could he do?\n'I'm a king, now.' He snorted. 'King of the Northmen, would you believe it?' He\nwas thinking she'd laugh in his face, but she just stood, listening to the wall. 'Me and\nLuthar, both. A pair of kings. Can you think of two more worthless bastards to put\ncrowns on, eh?' No answer.\nLogen licked his lips. No choice but to get straight to it, maybe. 'Ferro. The way\nthings turned out. The way we… left it.' He took a step towards her, and another. 'I\nwish I hadn't… I don't know…' He put one hand on her shoulder. 'Ferro, I'm trying\nto tell you—'\nShe turned, quickly, plastered her hand over his mouth. 'Shhhhh.'

Do you hear\nthem?'\nHe reached out, slowly, and touched the back of her neck, ran his rough\nfingertips over her skin. She shook him off with a jerk of her shoulders, and he felt\nhis face twist. Perhaps that good thing between them had been only in his mind, and\nnever in hers. Perhaps he had wanted it so badly that he had let himself imagine it.\nHe stood up, cleared his dry throat. 'Never mind. I'll come back later, maybe.'\nShe was still on her knees, her head against the floor. She did not even watch him\nleave.\nLogen Ninefingers was no stranger to death. He'd walked among it all his days. He'd\nwatched the bodies burned by the score after the battle at Carleon, long ago. He'd\nseen them buried by the hundred up in the nameless valley in the High Places. He'd\nwalked on a hill of men's bones under ruined Aulcus.\nBut even the Bloody-Nine, even the most feared man in the North, had never\nlooked on anything like this.\nBodies were stacked beside the wide avenue in heaps, chest-high. Sagging\nmounds of corpses, on and on. Hundreds upon hundreds. Too many for him to\nguess at the numbers. Someone had made an effort at covering them, but not that\ngreat an effort. The dead give no thanks for it, after all. Ragged sheets flapped in the\nbreeze, weighted down with broken wood, limp hands and feet hanging out from\nunderneath.\nAt this end of the road a few statues still stood. Once-proud kings and their\nadvisers, stone faces and bodies scarred and pitted, stared sadly down at the bloody\nwaste heaped round their feet. Enough of them for Logen to recognise that this truly\nwas the Kingsway, and that he hadn't somehow stumbled into the land of the dead.\nA hundred strides further and there were only empty plinths, one with broken legs\nstill attached. A strange group were clustered around them. Withered-looking.\nSomewhere between dead and alive. A man sat on a block of stone, staring numbly\nas he pulled handfuls of hair out of his head. Another was coughing into a bloody\nrag. A woman and a man lay side by side, gawping at nothing, faces shrivelled to\nlittle more than skulls. Her breath came crackling short and fast. His did not come at\nall.\nAnother hundred strides and it was as if Logen walked through some ruined hell.\nThere was no sign that statues, buildings, or anything else had ever stood there. In\ntheir place were only tangled hills of strange rubbish. Broken stone, splintered wood,\ntwisted metal, paper, glass, all crushed together and bound up with tons of dust and\nmud. Things stuck from the wreckage, strangely intact—a door, a chair, a carpet, a\npainted plate, the smiling face of a statue.\nMen and women struggled everywhere among this chaos, streaked with dirt,"

Things stuck from the wreckage, strangely intact—a door, a chair, a carpet, a\npainted plate, the smiling face of a statue.\nMen and women struggled everywhere among this chaos, streaked with dirt,\npicking at the rubbish, throwing it down to the road, trying to clear paths through it.\nRescuers, workmen, thieves, who knew? Logen passed by a crackling bonfire high\nas a man, felt the kiss of its heat on his cheek. A big soldier in armour stained with\nblack soot stood beside it. 'You find anything in white metal?' he was roaring at the\nsearchers, 'anything at all? It goes in the fire! Flesh in white metal? Burn it! Orders of\nthe Closed Council!'\nA few strides further on, someone was on top of one of the highest mounds,\nstraining at a great length of wood. He turned round to get a better grip. None other\nthan Jezal dan Luthar. His clothes were torn and grubby, his face was smudged with\nmud. He barely looked any more like a king than Logen did.\nA thickset man stood staring up, one arm in a sling. 'Your Majesty, this is not\nsafe!' he piped in an oddly girlish voice. 'We really should be—'\n'No! This is where I'm needed!' Jezal bent back over the beam, straining at it,\nveins bulging from his neck. There was no way he was going to get it shifted on his\nown, but still he tried. Logen stood watching him. 'How long's he been like this?'\n'All night, and all day,' said the thickset man, 'and no sign of stopping. Those few\nwe've found alive, nearly all of them have this sickness.' He waved his good arm\ntowards the pitiful group beside the statues. 'Their hair falls out. Their nails. Their\nteeth. They wither. Some have died already. Others are well on the way.' He slowly\nshook his head. 'What crime did we commit to deserve this punishment?'\n'Punishment doesn't always come to the guilty.'\n'Ninefingers!' Jezal was looking down, the watery sun behind him. 'There's a\nstrong back! Grab the end of that beam there!'\nIt was hard to see what good shifting a beam might do, in all of this. But great\njourneys start with small steps, Logen's father had always told him. So he clambered\nup, wood cracking and stones sliding underneath his boots, hauled himself to the top\nand stood there, staring.\n'By the dead.' From where he was standing, the hills of wreckage seemed to go\non forever. People crawled over them, dragging frantically at the rubble, sorting\ncarefully through it, or simply standing like him, stunned by the scale of it. A circle\nof utter waste, a mile across or more.\n'Help me, Logen!'\n'Aye. Right.' He bent down and dug his hands under one end of the great length\nof scarred wood. Two kings, dragging at a beam. The kings of mud.\n'Pull, then!' Logen heaved, his stitches burning. Gradually he felt the wood shift.\n'Yes!' grunted Jezal through gritted teeth. Together they lifted it, hauled it to one side."

One broken arm was wrapped around a child,\ncurly hair dark with blood.\n'Alright.' Jezal wiped slowly at his mouth with the back of one dirty hand.\n'Alright. Well. We'll put them with the rest of the dead.' He clambered further over\nthe wreckage. 'You! Bring that crowbar up here! Up here, and a pick, we need to\nclear this stone! Stack it there. We'll need it, later. To rebuild!'\nLogen put a hand on his shoulder. 'Jezal, wait. Wait. You know me.'\n'Of course. I like to think so.'\n'Alright. Tell me something, then. Am I…' He struggled to find the right words.\n'Am I… an evil man?'\n'You?' Jezal stared at him, confused. 'You're the best man I know.'\nThey were gathered under a broken tree in the park, a shadowy crowd of them.\nBlack outlines of men, standing calm and still, red clouds and golden spread out\nabove, around the setting sun. Logen could hear their slow voices as he walked up.\nWords for the dead, soft and sad. He could see the graves at their feet. Two dozen\npiles of fresh turned earth, set out in a circle so each man was equal. The Great\nLeveller, just as the hillmen say. Men put in the mud, and men saying words.\nCould've been a scene out of the old North, long ago in the time of Skarling\nHoodless.\n'… Harding Grim. I never saw a better man with a bow. Not ever. Can't count the\nnumber o' times he saved my life, and never expected thanks for it. Except maybe\nthat I'd do the same for him. Guess I couldn't, this time. Guess none of us could…'\nThe Dogman's voice trailed off. A few heads turned to look at Logen as his\nfootsteps crunched in the gravel. 'If it ain't the King o' the Northmen,' someone said.\n'The Bloody-Nine his self.'\n'We should bow, shouldn't we?'\nThey were all looking at him now. He could see their eyes gleaming in the dusk.\nNothing more than shaggy outlines, hard to tell one man from another. A crowd of\nshadows. A crowd of ghosts, and just as unfriendly.\n'You got something you want to say, Bloody-Nine?' came a voice from near the\nback.\n'I don't reckon,' he said. 'You're doing alright.'\n'Was no reason for us to be here.' A few mumbles of agreement.\n'Not our bloody fight.'\n'No need for them to have died.'

To make arrests, and obtain confessions. And\nwho else is there, now? Arch Lector Sult? Oh, dear me, no.\nGlokta wheezed up to his door, his few teeth bared at the endless pains in his\nlegs. A fortunate decision, at least, to move to the eastern side of the Agriont. One\nshould be grateful for the small things in life, like a place to rest one's crippled\nhusk. My old lodgings are no doubt languishing under a thousand tons of rubble,\njust like the rest of-—\nHis door was not quite shut. He gave it the gentlest of pushes and it creaked\nopen, soft lamplight spilling out into the corridor, a glowing stripe over the dusty\nfloorboards, over the foot of Glokta's cane and the muddy toe of one boot. I left no\ndoor unlocked, and certainly no lamps burning. His tongue slithered nervously\nover his empty gums. A visitor, then. An uninvited one. Do I go in, and welcome\nthem to my rooms? His eyes slid sideways into the shadows of the corridor. Or do I\nmake a run for it? He was almost smiling as he shuffled over the threshold, cane\nfirst, then the right foot, then the left, dragging painfully behind him.\nGlokta's guest sat by the window in the light of a single lamp, brightness splashed\nacross the hard planes of his face, cold darkness gathered in the deep hollows. The\nsquares board was set before him, just as Glokta left it, the pieces casting long\nshadows across the chequered wood.\n'Why, Superior Glokta. I have been waiting for you.'\nAnd I for you. Glokta limped over to the table, his cane scraping against the bare\nboards. As reluctantly as a man limping to the gallows. Ah, well. No one tricks the\nhangman forever. Perhaps we'll have some answers, at least, before the end. I\nalways dreamed of dying well-informed. Slowly, ever so slowly, he lowered himself\ngrunting into the free chair."

'Both, of course.'\nGlokta wrapped his tongue round one of his few remaining teeth and dragged it\naway with a faint sucking sound. 'And to what do I owe the overpowering honour?'\n'I said, did I not, that day we visited the Maker's House, that we should have a\ntalk at some point? A talk about what I want, and about what you want? That point\nhas come.'\n'Oh joyous day.'\nThe First of the Magi watched him, the same look in his bright eyes that a man\nmight have while watching an interesting beetle. 'I must admit that you fascinate me,\nSuperior. Your life would seem to be entirely unbearable. And yet you fight so very,\nvery hard to stay alive. With every weapon and stratagem. You simply refuse to die.'\n'I am ready to die.' Glokta returned his gaze, like for like. 'But I refuse to lose.'\n'Whatever the cost, eh? We are two of a kind, you and I, and we are a rare kind\nindeed. We understand what must be done, and we do not flinch from doing it,\nregardless of sentiment. You remember Lord Chancellor Feekt, of course.'\nIf I cast my mind a long way back… 'The Golden Chancellor? They say he ran\nthe Closed Council for forty years. They say he ran the Union.' Sult said so. Sult\nsaid his death left a hole, into which he and Marovia were both keen to step. That\nis where this ugly dance began, for me. With a visit from the Arch Lector, with the\nconfession of my old friend Salem Rews, with the arrest of Sepp dan Teufel,\nMaster of the Mints…\nBayaz let one thick fingertip trail across the pieces on the squares board, as\nthough considering his next move. 'We had an agreement, Feekt and I. I made him\npowerful. He served me, utterly.'\nFeekt… the foundation on which the nation rested… served you? I expected\ndelusions of grandeur, but this will take some beating. 'You would have me\nsuppose that you controlled the Union all that time?'\nBayaz snorted. 'Ever since I forced the damn thing together in the time of Harod\nthe Great, so-called. It has sometimes been necessary for me to take a hand myself,\nas in this most recent crisis. But mostly I have stood at a distance, behind the\ncurtain, as it were.'\n'A little stuffy back there, one imagines.'\n'An uncomfortable necessity.' The lamplight gleamed on the Magus' white grin.\n'People like to watch the pretty puppets, Superior. Even a glimpse of the puppeteer\ncan be most upsetting for them. Why, they might even suddenly notice the strings\naround their own wrists. Sult caught a glimpse of something, behind the curtain, and\nonly look at the trouble he caused for everyone.'

Acres of charming devastation. 'All\nthis. Why such generosity?'\n'Not entirely selfless, I must confess. Khalul had the Gurkish to fight for him. I\nneeded soldiers of my own. Even the greatest of generals needs little men to hold the\nline.' He absently nudged one of the smallest pieces forward. 'Even the greatest of\nwarriors needs his armour.'\nGlokta stuck out his bottom lip. 'But then Feekt died, and you were left naked.'\n'Naked as a babe, at my age.' Bayaz gave a long sigh. 'And in poor weather too,\nwith Khalul making ready for war. I should have arranged a suitable successor more\nquickly, but my thoughts were elsewhere, deep in my books. The older you get, the\nmore swiftly the years pass. It's easy to forget how quickly people die.'\nAnd how easily. 'The death of the Golden Chancellor left a vacuum,' muttered\nGlokta, thinking it through. 'Sult and Marovia saw a chance to take power for\nthemselves, and advance their own notions of what the nation should be.'\n'Exceptionally cock-eyed notions, as it happens. Sult wanted to return to an\nimaginary past where everyone kept their place and always did as they were told, and\nMarovia? Hah! Marovia wanted to piss power away to the people. Votes? Elections?\nThe voice of the common man?'\n'He aired some such notion.'\n'I hope you aired the suitable level of contempt. Power for the people?' sneered\nBayaz. 'They don't want it. They don't understand it. What the hell would they do\nwith it if they had it? The people are like children. They are children. They need\nsomeone to tell them what to do.'\n'Someone like you, I suppose?'\n'Who better suited? Marovia thought to use me in his petty schemes, and all the\nwhile I made good use of him. While he tussled with Sult over scraps the game was\nalready won. A move I had prepared some time before.'\nGlokta slowly nodded. 'Jezal dan Luthar.' Our little bastard.\n'Your friend and mine.'\nBut a bastard is no use unless… 'Crown Prince Raynault stood in the way.'\nThe Magus flicked a piece over and it rolled slowly from the board and rattled to\nthe table. 'We talk of great events. There is sure to be some wastage.'\n'You made it seem that he was killed by an Eater.'\n'Oh, he was.' Bayaz watched smugly from the shadows. 'Not all who break the\nSecond Law serve Khalul. My apprentice, Yoru Sulfur, has long been partial to a\nbite or two.' And he snapped his two rows of smooth and even teeth together.\n'I see.'\n'This is war, Superior. In war one must make use of every weapon. Restraint is\nfolly. Worse. Restraint is cowardice. But only look who I am lecturing. You need no\nlessons in ruthlessness.'"

You need no\nlessons in ruthlessness.'\n'No.' They cut them into me in the Emperors prisons, and I have been\npractising them ever since.\nBayaz nudged one of the pieces gently forward. 'A useful man, Sulfur. A man\nwho long ago accepted the demands of necessity, and mastered the discipline of\ntaking forms.' He was the guard, weeping outside Prince Raynault's door. The\nguard who vanished into thin air the next day…\n'A shred of cloth taken from the Emissary's bed-chamber,' murmured Glokta.\n'Blood daubed on his robe.' And so an innocent man went to the gallows, and the\nwar between Gurkhul and the Union blossomed. Two obstacles swept neatly away\nwith one sharp flick of the broom.\n'Peace with the Gurkish did not suit my purposes. It was sloppy of Sulfur to\nleave such blatant clues. But then he never expected you to care about the truth when\nthere was a convenient explanation to hand.'\nGlokta nodded, slowly, as the shape of things unfolded in his mind. 'He heard of\nmy investigations from Severard, and I received a charming visit from your walking\ncorpse, Mauthis, telling me to halt or die.'\n'Exactly so. On other occasions Yoru took another face, and called himself the\nTanner, and incited a few peasants to some rather unbecoming behaviour.' Bayaz\nexamined his fingernails. 'All in a good cause, though, Superior.'\n'To lend glamour to your latest puppet. To make him a favourite with the people.\nTo make him familiar to the nobles, to the Closed Council. You were the source of\nthe rumours.'\n'Heroic acts in the ruined west? Jezal dan Luthar?' Bayaz snorted. 'He did little\nmore than whine about the rain.'\n'Amazing the rubbish idiots will believe if you shout it loudly enough. And you\nrigged the Contest too.'\n'You noticed that?' Bayaz' smile grew wider. 'I am impressed, Superior, I am\nmost impressed. You have fumbled so very close to the truth this whole time.' And\nyet so very far away. 'I wouldn't feel badly about it. I have many advantages. Sult\ngroped towards the answers, in the end, but far too late. I suspected from the first\nwhat his plans might be.'\n'Which is why you asked me to investigate?'\n'The fact that you did not oblige me until the very last moment was the source of\nsome annoyance.'\n'Asking nicely might have helped.' It would have been refreshing, at least. 'I\nregret that I found myself in a difficult position. A case of too many masters.'\n'No longer, though, eh? I was almost disappointed when I found out how limited\nSult's studies were. Salt, and candles, and incantations? How pathetically adolescent.\nEnough to put a timely end to that would-be democrat Marovia, perhaps, but nothing\nto pose the slightest threat to me.'\nGlokta frowned down at the squares board.

For all their\ncleverness, for all their power, their ugly little struggle was an irrelevance. They\nwere small pieces in this game. So small they never even guessed how vast the\nboard truly was. Which makes me what? A speck of dust between the squares, at\nbest.\n'What of the mysterious visitor to your chambers the day I first met you?' A\nvisitor to my chambers too, perhaps? A woman, and cold…\nAngry lines cut across Bayaz' forehead. 'A mistake made in my youth. You will\nspeak no more of it.'\n'Oh, as you command. And the Great Prophet Khalul?'\n'The war will continue. On different battlefields, with different soldiers. But this\nwill be the last battle fought with the weapons of the past. The magic leaks from the\nworld. The lessons of the Old Time fade into the darkness of history. A new age\ndawns.'\nThe Magus made a careless movement with one hand and something flickered\ninto the air, clattered to the centre of the board and spun round and round until it lay\nflat, with the unmistakable sound of falling money. A golden fifty-mark piece, glinting\nwarm and welcoming in the lamplight. Glokta almost laughed. Ah, even now, even\nhere, it always comes down to this. Everything has a price.\n'It was money that bought victory in King Guslav's half-baked Gurkish war,' said\nBayaz. 'It was money that united the Open Council behind their bastard king. It was\nmoney that brought Duke Orso rushing to the defence of his daughter and tipped the\nbalance in our favour. All my money.'\n'It was money that enabled me to hold Dagoska as long as I did.'\n'And you know whose.' Who would have thought? More first of the\nmoneylenders than First of the Magi. Open Council and Closed, commoners and\nkings, merchants and torturers, all caught up in a golden web. A web of debts,\nand lies, and secrets, each strand plucked in its proper place, played like a harp\nby a master. And what of poor Superior Glokta, fumbling buffoon? Is there a\nplace for his sour note in this sweet music? Or is the loan of my life about to be\ncalled in?\n'I suppose I should congratulate you on a hand well played,' muttered Glokta\nbitterly.\n'Bah.' Bayaz dismissed it with a wave. 'Forcing a clutch of primitives together\nunder that cretin Harod and making them act like civilised men. Keeping the Union in\none piece through the civil war and bringing that fool Arnault to the throne. Guiding\nthat coward Casamir to the conquest of Angland. Those were hands well played.\nThis was nothing. I hold all the cards and always will do. I have—'\nI tire of this. 'And blah, blah, fucking blah. The stench of self-satisfaction is\nbecoming quite suffocating.

Long enough for Glokta's leg to start trembling, for his eye to start\nblinking, for his toothless mouth to turn dry as the desert. Sweet anticipation. Will it\nbe now? Will it be now? Will it be—'Kill you?' asked Bayaz mildly. 'And rob\nmyself of your winning sense of humour?'\nNot now. 'Then… why reveal your game to me?'\n'Because I will soon be leaving Adua.' The Magus leaned forwards, his hard face\nsliding into the light. 'Because it is necessary that you understand where the power\nlies, and always will lie. It is necessary that you, unlike Sult, unlike Marovia, have a\nproper perspective. It is necessary… if you are to serve me.'\n'To serve you?' I would sooner spend two years in the stinking darkness. I\nwould sooner have my leg chopped to mincemeat. I would sooner have my teeth\npulled from my head. But since I have done all those things already…\n'You will take the task that Feekt once had. The task that a score of great men\nbore before him. You will be my representative, here in the Union. You will manage\nthe Closed Council, the Open Council, and our mutual friend the king. You will\nensure him heirs. You will maintain stability. In short, you will watch the board, while\nI am gone.'\n'But the rest of the Closed Council will never—'\n'Those that survive have been spoken to. They all will bow to your authority.\nUnder mine, of course.'\n'How will I—'\n'I will be in touch. Frequently. Through my people at the bank. Through my\napprentice, Sulfur. Through other means. You will know them.'\n'I don't suppose I have any choice in the matter?'\n'Not unless you can repay the million marks I leant you. Plus interest.'\nGlokta patted at the front of his shirt. 'Damn it. I left my purse at work.'\n'Then I fear you have no choice. But why would you refuse me? I offer you the\nchance to help me forge a new age.' To bury my hands to the elbow in your dirty\nwork. 'To be a great man. The very greatest of men.' To bestride the Closed Council\nlike a crippled colossus. 'To leave your likeness set in stone on the Kingsway.'\nWhere its hideousness can make the children cry. Once they clear away the rubble\nand the corpses, of course. 'To shape the course of a nation.'\n'Under your direction.'\n'Naturally. Nothing is free, you know that.' Again the Magus flicked his hand and\nsomething clattered spinning across the squares board. It came to rest in front of\nGlokta, gold glinting. The Arch Lector's ring. So many times I bent to kiss this very\njewel. Who could have dreamed that I might one day wear it?

But\nwhat choice do I have? What choices do any of us truly have? He slid the ring onto\nhis finger. The great stone shone in the lamplight, full of purple sparks. From a dead\nman to the greatest in the realm, and all in one evening.\n'It fits,' murmured Glokta.\n'Of course, your Eminence. I always knew it would.'\nThe Wounded\n« ^ »\nWest woke with a start and tried to jerk up to sitting. Pain shot up one leg, across his\nchest, through his right arm, and stayed there, throbbing. He dropped back with a\ngroan and stared at the ceiling. A vaulted stone ceiling, covered in thick shadows.\nSounds crept at him now from all around. Grunts and whimpers, coughs and\nsobs, quick gasping, slow growling. The occasional outright shriek of pain. Sounds\nbetween men and animals. A voice whispered throatily from somewhere to his left,\ndroning endlessly away like a rat scratching at the walls. 'I can't see. Bloody wind. I\ncan't see. Where am I? Somebody. I can't see.'\nWest swallowed, feeling the pain growing worse. In the hospitals in Gurkhul there\nhad been sounds like that, when he had come to visit wounded soldiers from his\ncompany. He remembered the stink and noise of those horrible tents, the misery of\nthe men in them, and above all the overpowering desire to leave and be among the\nhealthy. But it was already awfully clear that leaving would not be so easy this time.\nHe was one of the wounded. A different, contemptible and disgusting species.\nHorror crept slowly through his body and mingled with the pain. How badly was he\ninjured? Did he have all his limbs, still? He tried to move his fingers, wriggle his toes,\nclenched his teeth as the aching in his arm and leg grew worse. He brought his left\nhand trembling up before his face, turned it over in the dimness. It seemed intact, at\nleast, but it was the only limb that he could move, and even that was a crushing\neffort. Panic slithered up his throat and clutched at him.\n'Where am I? Bloody wind. I can't see. Help. Help. Where am I?'\n'Fucking shut up!' West shouted, but the words died in his dry throat. All that\ncame up was a hollow cough that set his ribs on fire again.\n'Shhhh.' A soft touch on his chest. 'Just be still.'\nA blurry face swam into view. A woman's face, he thought, with fair hair, but it\nwas hard to focus. He closed his eyes and stopped trying. It hardly seemed to\nmatter that much. He felt something against his lips, the neck of a bottle. He drank\ntoo thirstily, spluttered and felt cold water running down his neck.\n'What happened?' he croaked.\n'You were wounded.'\n'I know that. I mean… in the city. The wind.'\n'I don't know. I don't think anyone knows.'\n'Did we win?'\n'I suppose that… the Gurkish were driven out, yes. But there are a lot of"

A lot of dead.'\nAnother swallow of water. This time he managed it without gagging. 'Who are\nyou?'\n'My name is Ariss. Dan Kaspa.'\n'Ariss…' West fumbled with the name. 'I knew your cousin. Knew him well… a\ngood man. He always used to talk about… how beautiful you were. And rich,' he\nmuttered, vaguely aware he should not be saying this, but unable to stop his mouth\nfrom working. 'Very rich. He died. In the mountains.'\n'I know.'\n'What are you doing here?'\n'Trying to help with the wounded. It would be best for you to sleep now, if\nyou—'\n'Am I whole?'\nA pause. 'Yes. Sleep now, if you can.'\nHer dark face grew blurry, and West let his eyes close. The noises of agony\nslowly faded around him. He was whole. All would be well.\nSomeone was sitting next to his bed. Ardee. His sister. He blinked, worked his sour\nmouth, unsure where he was for a moment.\n'Am I dreaming?' She reached forward and dug her nails into his arm. 'Ah!'\n'Painful dream, eh?'\n'No,' he was forced to admit. 'This is real.'\nShe looked well. Far better than the last time he had seen her, that was sure. No\nblood on her face for one thing. No look of naked hatred, for another. Only a\nthoughtful frown. He tried to bring himself up to sitting, failed, and slumped back\ndown. She did not offer to help. He had not really expected her to. 'How bad is it?'\nhe asked.\n'Nothing too serious, apparently. A broken arm, a few broken ribs, and a leg\nbadly bruised, they tell me. Some cuts on your face that may leave a scar or two, but\nthen I got all the looks in the family anyway.'\nHe gave a snort of laughter and winced at the pain across his chest. 'True\nenough. The brains too.'\n'Don't feel badly about it. I've used them to make the towering success of my life\nthat you see before you. The kind of achievement that you, as a Lord Marshal of the\nUnion, can only dream of.'\n'Don't,' he hissed, clamping his good hand across his ribs. 'It hurts.'\n'No less than you deserve.'\nHis laughter quickly stuttered out, and they were silent for a moment, looking at\neach other. Even that much was difficult. 'Ardee…' His voice caught in his sore\nneck. 'Can you… forgive me?'\n'I already did. The first time I heard you were dead.' She was trying to smile, he\ncould tell. But she still had that twist of anger to her mouth. Probably she would\nhave liked to dig her nails into his face rather than his arm. He was almost glad then,\nfor a moment, that he was wounded. She had no choice but to be soft with him. 'It's\ngood that you're not. Dead, that is…' She frowned over her shoulder. There was"

There was\nsome manner of commotion at one end of the long cellar. Raised voices, the clatter\nof armoured footsteps.\n'The king!' Whoever it was nearly squealed it in their excitement. 'The king is\ncome again!'\nIn the beds all around men turned their heads, propped themselves up. A nervous\nexcitement spread from cot to cot. 'The king?' they whispered, faces anxious and\nexpectant, as though they were privileged to witness a divine visitation.\nSeveral figures moved through the shadows at the far end of the hall. West\nstrained to look, but could see little more than metal gleaming in the darkness. The\nforemost shape stopped beside a wounded man a few beds down.\n'They are treating you well?' A voice strangely familiar, strangely different.\n'Yes, sir.'\n'Is there anything you need?'\n'A kiss from a good woman?'\n'I would love to oblige you, but I fear I'm only a king. We're a great deal more\ncommon than good women.' Men laughed, even though it was not funny. West\nsupposed that people laughing at your poor jokes was one advantage of being a\nmonarch. 'Anything else?'\n'Maybe… maybe another blanket, sir. Getting cold down here, at night.'\n'Of course.' The figure jerked his thumb at a man behind. Lord Hoff, West\nrealised now, dragging along at a respectful distance. 'Another blanket for every man\nhere.'\nThe Lord Chamberlain, that fearsome scourge of the audience chamber, humbly\nnodded his head like a meek child. The king stood, and moved into the light.\nJezal dan Luthar, of course, and yet it was hard to believe that it was the same\nman, and not only because of the rich fur mantle and the golden circlet on his\nforehead. He seemed taller. Handsome, still, but no longer boyish. A deep scar on\nhis bearded jaw had given him an air of strength. The sneer of arrogance had\nbecome a frown of command. The carefree swagger had become a purposeful\nstride. He worked his way on slowly down the aisle between the cots, speaking to\neach man, pressing their hands, giving them thanks, promising them help. No one\nwas overlooked.\n'A cheer for the king!' someone gurgled through gritted teeth.\n'No! No. The cheering should be for you, my brave friends! You who have made\nsacrifices in my name. I owe you everything. It was only with your help that the\nGurkish were defeated. Only with your help that the Union was saved. I do not\nforget a debt, that I promise you!'\nWest stared. Whoever this strange apparition was who looked so like Jezal dan\nLuthar, he spoke like a monarch. West almost felt a preposterous desire to drag\nhimself from his bed and kneel. One casualty was trying to do just that as the king\npassed his bed.

His face lit up, though there was a\ntooth missing from his smile. 'Collem West!' he said, hastening over. 'I can honestly\nsay that I have never in my life been so pleased to see your face.'\n'Er…' West moved his mouth around a bit, but hardly knew what to say.\nJezal turned to his sister. 'Ardee… I hope you are well.'\n'Yes.' She said nothing else. They stared at each other, for a long and intensely\nawkward moment, not speaking.\nLord Hoff frowned at the king, then at West, then at Ardee. He insinuated himself\nsomewhat between the two of them. 'Your Majesty, we should—'\nJezal silenced him effortlessly with one raised hand. 'I trust that you will soon join\nme in the Closed Council, West. I am in some need of a friendly face there, in truth.\nNot to mention good advice. You always were a mine of good advice. I never did\nthank you for it. Well, I can thank you now.'\n'Jezal… I mean, your Majesty—'\n'No, no. Always Jezal to you, I hope. You will have a room in the palace, of\ncourse. You will have the royal surgeon. Everything possible. See to that, please,\nHoff.'\nThe Lord Chamberlain bowed. 'Of course. Everything will be arranged.'\n'Good. Good. I am glad you are well, West. I cannot afford to lose you.' The\nking nodded, to him, and to his sister. Then he turned and moved on, pressing\nhands, speaking soft words. A pool of hope seemed to surround him as he passed.\nDespair crowded in behind it. Smiles faded as he moved away. Men dropped back\nonto their beads, faces clouding over with pain.\n'Responsibility seems to have improved him,' muttered West. 'Almost beyond\nrecognition.'\n'How long will it last, do you think?'\n'I'd like to think that it could stick, but then I've always been an optimist.'\n'That's good.' Ardee watched the magnificent new king of the Union striding\naway, wounded men straining from their cots for the slightest touch of his cloak.\n'That one of us can be.'\n'Marshal West!'\n'Jalenhorm. Good to see you.' West pulled back the blankets with his good hand,\neased his legs over the edge of the bed and winced his way up to sitting. The big\nman reached out and gave his hand a squeeze, clapped him on the shoulder.\n'You're looking well!'\nWest smiled weakly. 'Better ever day, Major. How's my army?'\n'Fumbling on without you. Kroy's holding things together. Not such a bad sort,\nthe General, once you get used to him.'\n'If you say so. How many did we lose?'\n'Still hard to say. Things are somewhat chaotic.

There was no fanfare to\nmark the moment when his aching arse touched the hard wood. No round of\napplause. Only a sharp clicking in his burning knee. And yet it is a moment of the\ngreatest significance, and not only for me.\nThe designers of the White Chamber's furniture had ventured beyond austerity\nand into the realm of profound discomfort. One would have thought that they\ncould have stretched to some upholstery for the most powerful men in the realm.\nPerhaps the intention was to remind the occupants that one should never become\ntoo comfortable at the pinnacle of power. He glanced sideways, and saw Bayaz\nwatching him. Well, uncomfortable is about as good as I ever get. Have I not often\nsaid so? He winced as he tried to worm his way forwards, the legs of his chair\nsquealing noisily against the floor.\nLong ago, when I was handsome, young, and promising, I dreamed of one day\nsitting at this table as a noble Lord Marshal, or a respected High Justice, or even\nan honourable Lord Chamberlain. Who could ever have suspected, even in their\ndarkest moments, that beautiful Sand dan Glokta would one day sit on the Closed\nCouncil as the feared, the abhorred, the all-powerful Arch Lector of the Inquisition\n? He could scarcely keep the smile from his toothless mouth as he slumped back\nagainst the unyielding wood.\nNot everyone appeared amused by his sudden elevation, however. King Jezal in\nparticular glowered at Glokta with the most profound dislike. 'Remarkable that you\nare confirmed already in your position,' he snapped.\nBayaz interposed. 'Such things can happen quickly when there is the will, your\nMajesty.'\n'After all,' observed Hoff, stealing a rare moment away from his goblet to sweep\nthe table with a melancholy glance, 'our numbers are most sadly reduced.'\nAll too true. Several chairs loomed significantly empty. Marshal Varuz was\nmissing, presumed dead. Certainly dead, given that he was conducting the defence\nfrom the Tower of Chains, a structure now scattered widely over the streets of the\ncity. Farewell, my old fencing master, farewell. High Justice Marovia had also left a\nvacant seat. No doubt they are still trying to scrape the frozen meat from the walls\nof his office. Adieu to my third suitor, I fear. Lord Valdis, Commander of the\nKnights Herald, was not in attendance. Keeping watch on the southern gate, I\nunderstand, when the Gurkish detonated their explosive powder. Body never\nfound, nor ever will be, one suspects. Lord Admiral Reutzer too, was absent.\nWounded at sea by a cutlass to the guts. Not expected to survive, alas.\nTruly, the pinnacle of power is less crowded than it used to be."

Not expected to survive, alas.\nTruly, the pinnacle of power is less crowded than it used to be.\n'Marshal West could not be with us?' asked Lord Chancellor Halleck.\n'He regrets that he cannot.' General Kroy seemed to pinch off each word with his\nteeth. 'He has asked me to take his place, and speak for the army.'\n'And how is the Marshal?'\n'Wounded.'\n'And further afflicted by the wasting illness that has recently swept the Agriont,'\nadded the king, frowning grimly down the table at the First of the Magi.\n'Regrettable.' Bayaz' face showed not the slightest sign of regret or anything else.\n'A terrible business,' lamented Hoff. 'The physicians are utterly baffled.'\n'Few survive.' Luthar's glare had become positively deadly.\n'Let us ardently hope,' gushed Torlichorm, 'that Marshal West is one of the lucky\nones.' Let us hope so indeed. Although hope changes nothing.\n'To business, then?' Wine gurgled from the pitcher as Hoff filled his goblet for\nthe second time since entering the room. 'How fares the campaign, General Kroy?'\n'The Gurkish army is utterly routed. We have pursued them towards Keln, where\nsome few managed to flee on the remnant of their fleet. Duke Orso's ships soon put\nan end to that, however. The Gurkish invasion is over. Victory is ours.' And yet he\nfrowns as though he is admitting defeat.\n'Excellent.'\n'The nation owes a debt of thanks to its brave soldiers.'\n'Our congratulations, General.'\nKroy stared down at the table-top. 'The congratulations belong to Marshal West,\nwho gave the orders, and to General Poulder and the others who gave their lives\ncarrying them out. I was no more than an observer.'\n'But you played your part, and admirably.' Hoff raised his goblet. 'Given the\nunfortunate absence of Marshal Varuz, I feel confident his Majesty will soon wish to\nconfer a promotion upon you.' He glanced towards the king, and Luthar grunted his\nunenthusiastic assent.\n'I am honoured to serve in whatever capacity his Majesty should decide, of\ncourse. The prisoners are a more urgent matter, however. We have many thousands\nof them, and no food with which to—'\n'We have not enough food for our own soldiers, our own citizens, our own\nwounded,' said Hoff, dabbing at his wet lips.\n'Ransom any men of quality back to the Emperor?' suggested Torlichorm.\n'There were precious few men of quality among their entire damn army.'\nBayaz frowned down the table. 'If they are of no value to the Emperor they are\ncertainly of no value to us. Let them starve.'\nA few men shifted uncomfortably. 'We are talking of thousands of lives, here—'\nbegan Kroy.\nThe gaze of the First of the Magi fell upon him like a great stone and squashed\nhis objections flat. 'I know what we are talking of, General. Enemies. Invaders.'\n'Surely we can find a way?' threw in the king. 'Could we not ship them back to\nKantic shores? It would be a shameful epilogue to our victory if—'"

A difficult decision, your Majesty, but those are the only kind\nwe have in this room. What would your opinion be, Arch Lector?'\nThe eyes of the king, and the old men in the high chairs, all turned towards\nGlokta. Ah, we know what must be done, and we do not flinch, and so forth. Let\nthe monster pronounce the sentence, so the rest can feel like decent men. 'I have\nnever been a great admirer of the Gurkish.' Glokta shrugged his aching shoulders.\n'Let them starve.'\nKing Jezal settled further into his throne with an even grimmer frown. Could it be\nthat our monarch is a touch less house-broken than the First of the Magi would\nlike to believe? Lord Chancellor Halleck cleared his throat. 'Now that victory is ours,\nour first concern, without question, is the clearing of the ruins, and the rebuilding of\nthe damage caused by…' his eyes shifted nervously sideways to Bayaz, and back.\n'Gurkish aggression.'\n'Hear, hear.'\n'Rebuilding. We are all agreed.'\n'The costs,' and Halleck winced as if the word caused him pain, 'even of clearing\nthe wreckage in the Agriont alone, may run to many tens of thousands of marks. The\nprice of rebuilding, many millions. When we consider the extensive damage to the\ncity of Adua besides… the costs…' Halleck scowled again and rubbed at his\nill-shaved jaw with one hand. 'Difficult even to guess at.'\n'We can only do our best.' Hoff sadly shook his head. 'And find one mark at a\ntime.'\n'I, for one, suggest we look to the nobles,' said Glokta. There were several\ngrumbles of agreement.\n'His Eminence makes a fine point.'\n'A sharp curtailment of the powers of the Open Council,' said Halleck.\n'Harsh taxes on those who did not provide material support in the recent war.'\n'Excellent! Trim the nobles' sails. Damn parasites.'\n'Sweeping reforms. Lands returned to the crown. Levies on inheritance.'\n'On inheritance! An inspired notion!'\n'The Lord Governors too must be brought into the fold.'\n'Skald and Meed. Yes. They have long enjoyed too much independence.'\n'Meed can hardly be blamed, his province is a wreck—'\n'This is not a question of blame,' said Bayaz. No indeed, we all know where that\nlies. 'This is a question of control. Victory has given us the opportunity for reform.'\n'We need to centralise!'\n'Westport as well. Too long they have played us off against the Gurkish.'\n'They need us now.'\n'Perhaps we should extend the Inquisition to their city?' suggested Glokta.\n'A foothold in Styria!'\n'We must rebuild!' The First of the Magi thumped at the table with one meaty fist.\n'Better and more glorious even than before. The statues in the Kingsway may have\nfallen, but they have left space for new ones.'"

The statues in the Kingsway may have\nfallen, but they have left space for new ones.'\n'A new era of prosperity,' said Halleck, eyes shining.\n'A new era of power,' said Hoff, raising his goblet.\n'A golden age?' Bayaz looked up the table at Glokta.\n'An age of unity and opportunity for all!' said the king.\nHis offering fell somewhat flat. Eyes swivelled uncomfortably toward the king's\nend of the table. Quite as if he noisily farted, rather than spoke. 'Er… yes, your\nMajesty,' said Hoff. 'Opportunities.' For anyone lucky enough to sit on the Closed\nCouncil, that is.\n'Perhaps heavier taxes on the merchant guilds?' proffered Halleck. 'As our last\nArch Lector had in mind. The banks also. Such a move could produce vast\nincomes—'\n'No,' said Bayaz, offhand. 'Not the guilds, not the banks. The free operation of\nthose noble institutions provides wealth and security to all. The future of the nation\nlies in commerce.'\nHalleck humbly inclined his head. With more than a hint of fear, do I detect? 'Of\ncourse, Lord Bayaz, you are right. I freely admit my mistake.'\nThe Magus moved smoothly on. 'Perhaps the banks would be willing to extend a\nloan to the crown, however.'\n'An excellent idea,' said Glokta without hesitation. 'The banking house of Valint\nand Balk are a trustworthy and long-founded institution. They were of profound\nvalue during my attempts to defend Dagoska. I am sure we could count on their help\nagain.' Bayaz' smile was almost imperceptible. 'In the meantime the lands, assets, and\ntitles of the traitor Lord Brock have been requisitioned by the crown. Their sale will\nraise a considerable sum.'\n'And what of the man himself, Arch Lector?'\n'It would appear he fled the nation along with the last of the Gurkish. We assume\nthat he is still their… guest.'\n'Their puppet, you mean.' Bayaz sucked at his teeth. 'Unfortunate. He may\ncontinue to be a focus for discontent.'\n'Two of his children are under lock and key in the House of Questions. His\ndaughter and one of the sons. An exchange might be possible—'\n'Brock? Ha!' barked Hoff. 'He wouldn't swap his own life for the whole world\nand everything in it.'\nGlokta raised his eyebrows. 'Then perhaps a demonstration of intent? A clear\nmessage that treason will not and will never be tolerated?'\n'Never a bad message to send,' growled Bayaz to affirmative mutterings from the\nold men.\n'A public declaration of Brock's guilt, then, and his responsibility for the ruin of\nthe city of Adua. Accompanied by a pair of hangings.' A shame for them, to have\nbeen born to such an ambitious father, but everyone loves a public killing. 'Does\nanyone have a preference for a certain day or—'\n'There will be no hangings.' The king was frowning levelly at Bayaz.\nHoff blinked.

There were several sharp intakes of breath around the table. 'Allow them to\njoin their father, or remain in the Union as private citizens, as they desire.' Bayaz\nglared balefully from the far end of the room, but the king did not appear intimidated.\n'The war is over. We won.' The war never ends, and victory is temporary. 'I would\nrather try to heal wounds than deepen them.' A wounded enemy is the best kind,\nthey are the easiest to kill. 'Sometimes mercy buys you more than ruthlessness.'\nGlokta cleared his throat. 'Sometimes.' Though I myself have yet to see the\ncircumstance.\n'Good,' said the king in a voice that brooked no argument. 'Then it is decided.\nHave we other pressing business? I need to make a tour of the hospitals, and then\nonce more to clearing the wreckage.'\n'Of course, your Majesty.' Hoff gave a sycophantic bow. 'Your care for you\nsubjects does you much credit.'\nJezal stared at him for a moment, then snorted, and got up. He had already left\nthe room before most of the old men had struggled to their feet. And I take even\nlonger. When Glokta had finally wrestled his chair out of the way and grimaced to\nstanding, he found Hoff was beside him, a frown on his ruddy face. 'We have a\nsmall problem,' he muttered.\n'Indeed? Something we cannot raise with the rest of the Council?'\n'I fear so. Something which, in particular, it would be better not to discuss before\nhis Majesty.' Hoff looked quickly over his shoulder, waited for the last of the old\nmen to pull the heavy door shut behind him and leave the two of them unobserved.\nSecrets, then? How tremendously exciting. 'Our absent Lord Marshal's sister.'\nGlokta frowned. Oh dear. 'Ardee West? What of her?'\n'I have it on good authority, that she finds herself in… a delicate condition.'\nThe familiar flurry of twitches ran up the left side of Glokta's face. 'Is that so?'\nWhat a shame. 'You are remarkably well informed about that lady's personal\nbusiness.'\n'It is my duty to be so.' Hoff leaned close and blasted Glokta with wine-stinking\nbreath as he whispered. 'When you consider who the father might very well be.'\n'And that is?' Though I think we both already guess the answer.\n'Who else but the king?' hissed Hoff under his breath, a note of panic in his\nvoice. 'You must be well aware that they were involved in… a liaison, to put it\ndelicately, prior to his coronation. It is scarcely a secret. Now this? A bastard child!\nWhen the king's own claim to the throne is not of the purest? When he has so many\nenemies still on the Open Council? Such a child could be used against us, if it\nbecame known of, and it will, of course!' He leaned closer yet. 'Such a thing would\nconstitute a threat to the state.'\n'Indeed,' said Glokta icily. All too unfortunately true. What a terrible, terrible\nshame."

I can make the arrangements with\nno—'\nGlokta flashed his craziest grin. 'Are you implying that I lack sufficient\nruthlessness for the murder of a pregnant mother, Lord Chamberlain?' His voice\nbounced loud from the hard white walls, merciless as a knife-thrust.\nHoff winced, his eyes darting nervously towards the door. 'I am sure you would\nnot flinch from any patriotic duty—'\n'Good. You may rest easy, then. Our mutual friend did not select me for this role\nbecause of my soft heart.' Anything but. 'I will deal with the matter.'\nThe same small, brick-built house in the same unremarkable street that Glokta had\nvisited so often before. The same house where I spent so many enjoyable\nafternoons. As close as I have come to comfort since I was dragged drooling from\nthe Emperor's prisons. He slid his right hand into his pocket, felt the cold metal\nbrush against his fingertips. Why do I do this? Why? So that drunken arsehole Hoff\ncan mop his brow at a calamity averted? So that Jezal dan Luthar can sit a hair\nmore secure on his puppet throne? He twisted his hips one way and then the other\nuntil he felt his back click. She deserves so much better. But such is the terrible\narithmetic of power.\nHe pushed back the gate, hobbled up to the front door, and gave it a smart\nknock. It was a moment before the cringing maid answered. Perhaps the one who\nalerted our court drunkard Lord Hoff to the unfortunate situation? She showed\nhim through into the over-furnished sitting room with little more than a mumble and\nleft him there, staring at a small fire in the small grate. He caught a glimpse of himself\nin the mirror above the fireplace, and frowned.\nWho is that man? That ruined shell? That shambling corpse? Can you even\ncall it a face? So twisted and so lined, so etched with pain. What is this loathsome,\npitiable species? Oh, if there is a God, protect me from this thing!\nHe tried to smile. Savage grooves cut through his corpse-pale skin, the hideous\ngap in his teeth yawned. The corner of his mouth trembled, his left eye twitched,\nnarrower than the other, rimmed with angry red. The smile seems to promise horrors\nmore surely even than the frown.\nHas any man ever looked more of a villain? Has any man ever been more of a\nmonster? Could any vestige of humanity possibly remain behind such a mask?\nHow did beautiful Sand dan Glokta become… this? Mirrors. Even worse than\nstairs. His lip curled with disgust as he turned away.\nArdee stood in the doorway, watching him in silence. She looked well, to his\nmind, once he got over the awkward surprise of being observed.

She gave him an appraising glance as she stepped into the\nroom. 'White suits you.'\n'Truly? You do not feel it makes the skull-like rings about my feverish eyes look\nall the darker?'\n'Why, not at all. It perfectly matches your ghoulish pallor.'\nGlokta leered his toothless grin.

He watched her cross to the table, look out of the\nwindow towards the street, the daylight glowing through her dark air, down the edge\nof her cheek.\n'I trust that you are well?' she asked.\n'Busier even than the Gurkish. A great deal to do. How is your brother? I have\nbeen meaning to visit him, but…' But I doubt even I could stand the stink of my\nown hypocrisy if I did. I cause pain. The easing of it is a foreign tongue to me.\nArdee looked at her feet. 'He is always sick now. Every time I visit he is thinner.\nOne of his teeth fell out while I was with him.' She shrugged her shoulders. 'It just\ncame out while he was trying to eat. He nearly choked on it. But what can I do?\nWhat can anyone?'\n'I am truly sorry to hear it.' But it changes nothing. 'I am sure that you are a great\nhelp to him.' I am sure that there can be no help for him. 'And how are you?'\n'Better than most, I suppose.' She gave a long sigh, shook herself and tried to\nsmile. 'Will you take some wine?'\n'No, but don't let me stop you.' I know you never have.\nBut she only held the bottle for a moment, then set it down again. 'I have been\ntrying to drink less, lately.'\n'I have always felt that you should.' He took a slow step towards her. 'You feel\nsick, then, in the mornings?'\nShe looked sharply sideways, then swallowed, the thin muscles standing out from\nher neck. 'You know?'\n'I am the Arch Lector,' he said as he came closer. 'I am supposed to know\neverything.'\nHer shoulders sagged, her head dropped, she leaned forwards, both hands on the\nedge of the table. Glokta could see her eyelids fluttering, from the side. Blinking\nback the tears. For all of her anger, and her cleverness, she just as much in need\nof saving as anyone could be. But there is no one to come to the rescue. There is\nonly me.\n'I suppose I made quite a mess of things, just as my brother said I would. Just as\nyou said I would. You must be disappointed.'"

His\nmouth was dry, his tongue slurped awkwardly against his empty gums. Now is the\ntime. 'Over the past months I have developed a great liking and respect for you.' A\nflurry of twitches ran up the side of his face and made a tear leak from his flickering\neye. Now, now. 'Or… as close to such feelings as a man like myself can come, at\nleast.' Glokta slid his hand into his pocket, carefully, so she would not notice. He felt\nthe cold metal, the hard, merciless edges brushing against his skin. It must be now.\nHis heart was pounding, his throat so tight that he could barely speak. 'This is\ndifficult. I am… sorry.'\n'For what?' she said, frowning at him.\nNow.\nHe lurched towards her, snatching his hand from his pocket. She stumbled back\nagainst the table, eyes wide… and they both froze.\nThe ring glittered between them. A colossal, flashing diamond so large it made\nthe thick golden band look flimsy. So large it looks a joke. A fake. An absurd\nimpossibility. The biggest stone that Valint and Balk had to offer.\n'I have to ask you to marry me,' he croaked.

My thanks,\nbut I would rather die. 'I should be honest with you. When I was younger… I did\nsome foolish things.' Her mouth twisted.

'There is nothing to think about, is there?' Scarcely the gushing acceptance,\nthe tearful acquiescence, the joyful surrender that one reads of in the story books.\nA reluctant business arrangement. An occasion for sad reflection on all that might\nhave been, but is not.\n'Who would have thought,' she murmured, staring at the jewel on her finger,\n'when I watched you fence with my brother, all those years ago, that I would one\nday wear your ring? You always were the man of my dreams.'\nAnd now of your nightmares. 'Life takes strange turns. The circumstances are\nnot quite what anyone would have predicted.' And so I save two lives. How much\nevil can that possibly outweigh? Yet it is something on the right side of the scales,\nat least. Every man needs something on the right side of the scales.\nHer dark eyes rolled up to his. 'Could you not have afforded a bigger stone?'\n'Only by raiding the treasury,' he croaked. A kiss would be traditional, but under\nthe circumstances—\nShe stepped towards him, lifting one arm. He lurched back, winced at a twinge in\nhis hip. 'Sorry. Somewhat… out of practice.'\n'If I am to do this, I mean to do it properly.'\n'To make the best of it, do you mean?'\n'To make something of it, anyway.' She drew closer still.

Those shadows.'\n'I saw nothing, aside from Mamun and his Hundred Words receiving the\npunishment they deserved.'\n'Did you not hear voices?'\n'Over the thunder of our victory? I heard nothing.'\n'I did.' Ferro lowered the knife and slid it into her belt. She worked the fingers of\nher hand, the same, and yet changed. 'I still hear them.'\n'And what do they tell you, Ferro?'\n'They speak of locks, and gates, and doors, and the opening of them. Always\nthey talk of opening them. They ask about the Seed. Where is it?'\n'Safe.' Bayaz gazed blankly at her. 'Remember, if you truly hear the creatures of\nthe Other Side, that they are made of lies.'\n'They are not alone in that. They ask me to break the First Law. Just as you did.'"

Bayaz had a proud twist to the corner of his mouth. As if\nhe had achieved something wonderful. 'I tempered Glustrod's disciplines with the\ntechniques of the Master Maker, and used the Seed as the engine for my Art. The\nresults were…' He took a long, satisfied breath. 'Well, you were there. It was, above\nall, a triumph of will.'\n'You tampered with the seals. You put the world at risk. The Tellers of\nSecrets…'\n'The First Law is a paradox. Whenever you change a thing you borrow from the\nworld below, and there are always risks. If I have crossed a line it is a line of scale\nonly. The world is safe, is it not? I make no apologies for the ambition of my vision.'\n'They are burying men, and women, and children, in pits for a hundred. Just as\nthey did in Aulcus. This sickness… it is because of what we did. Is that ambition,\nthen? The size of the graves?'\nBayaz gave a dismissive toss of his head. 'An unexpected side-effect. The price\nof victory, I fear, is the same now as it was in the Old Time, and always will be.' He\nfixed her with his eye, and there was a threat in it. A challenge. 'But if I broke the\nFirst Law, what then? In what court will you have me judged? By what jury? Will you\nrelease Tolomei from the darkness to give evidence? Will you seek out Zacharus to\nread the charge? Will you drag Cawneil from the edge of the World to deliver the\nverdict? Will you bring great Juvens from the land of the dead to pronounce the\nsentence? I think not. I am First of the Magi. I am the last authority and I say… I am\nrighteous.'\n'You? No.'\n'Yes, Ferro. Power makes all things right. That is my first law, and my last. That\nis the only law that I acknowledge.'\n'Zacharus warned me,' she murmured, thinking of the endless plain, the wild-eyed\nold man with his circling birds. 'He told me to run, and never stop running. I should\nhave listened to him.'\n'To that bloated bladder of self-righteousness?' Bayaz snorted. 'Perhaps you\nshould have, but that ship has sailed. You waved it away happily from the shore, and\nchose instead to feed your fury. Gladly you fed it. Let us not pretend that I deceived\nyou. You knew we were to walk dark paths.'\n'I did not expect…' she worked her icy fingers into a trembling fist. 'This.'\n'What did you expect, then? I must confess I thought you made of harder stuff.\nLet us leave the philosophising to those with more time and fewer scores to settle.\nGuilt, and regret, and righteousness? It is like talking with the great King Jezal. And\nwho has the patience for that?' He turned towards the door. 'You should stay near\nme. Perhaps, in time, Khalul will send other agents. Then I will have need of your\ntalents once again.'"

Bayaz flashed his white grin\nat her. 'You have your vengeance.'\nThe wind tore around her, rushed around her, full of shadows. She knelt at one end\nof a screaming tunnel, touching the very sky. The world was thin and brittle as a\nsheet of glass, ready to crack. Beyond it a bottomless void, filled with voices.\n'Let us in…'\n'No!' She thrashed her way free and struggled up, stood panting on the floor\nbeside her bed, every muscle rigid. But there was no one to fight. Another dream,\nonly.\nHer own fault, for letting herself sleep.\nA long strip of moonlight reached towards her across the tiles. The window at its\nend stood ajar, a cold night breeze washed through and chilled her sweat-beaded\nskin. She walked to it, frowning, pushed it shut and slid the bolt. She turned around.\nA figure stood in the thick shadows beside the door. A one-armed figure,\nswathed in rags. The few pieces of armour still strapped to him were scuffed and\ngouged. His face was a dusty ruin, torn skin hanging in scraps from white bone, but\neven so, Ferro knew him.\nMamun.\n'We meet again, devil-blood.' His dry voice rustled like old paper.\n'I am dreaming,' she hissed.\n'You will wish that you were.' He was across the room in a breathless instant. His\none hand closed round her throat like a lock snapping shut. 'Digging my way out of\nthat ruination one handful of dirt at a time has given me a hunger.' His dry breath\ntickled at her face. 'I will make myself a new arm from your flesh, and with it I will\nstrike down Bayaz and take vengeance for great Juvens. The Prophet has seen it, and\nI will turn his vision into truth.' He lifted her, effortlessly, crushed her back against\nthe wall, her heels kicking against the panelling.\nThe hand squeezed. Her chest heaved, but no air moved inside her neck. She\nstruggled with the fingers, ripped at them with her nails, but they were made of iron,\nmade of stone, tight as a hanged man's collar. She fought and twisted but he did not\nshift a hair's breadth. She fiddled with Mamun's ruined face, her fingers worked their\nway into his ripped cheek, tore at the dusty flesh inside but his eyes did not even\nblink. It had grown cold in the room.\n'Say your prayers, child,' he whispered, broken teeth grinding, 'and hope that\nGod is merciful.'\nShe was growing weaker now. Her lungs were bursting. She tore at him still, but\neach effort was less. Weaker and weaker. Her arms drooped, her legs dangled, her\neyelids were heavy, heavy. All was terrible cold.\n'Now,' he whispered, breath smoking. He brought her down, opening his mouth,\nhis torn lips sliding back from his splintered teeth. 'Now.'"

'Now.'\nHer finger stabbed into his neck. Through his skin and into his dry flesh, up to\nthe knuckle. It drove his head away. Her other hand wormed round his, prised it\nfrom her throat, bent his fingers backwards. She felt the bones in them snap, crunch,\nsplinter as she dropped to the floor. White frost crept out across the black\nwindow-panes beside her, squeaked under her bare feet as she twisted Mamun\nround and rammed him against the wall, crushed his body into the splintering panels,\nthe cracking plaster. Dust showered down from the force of it.\nShe drove her finger further into his throat, upwards, inwards. It was easy to do\nit. There was no end to her strength. It came from the other side of the divide. The\nSeed had changed her, as it had changed Tolomei, and there could be no going\nback.\nFerro smiled.\n'Take my flesh, would you? You have had your last meal, Mamun.'\nThe tip of her finger slid out between his teeth, met her thumb and hooked him\nlike a fish. With a jerk of her wrist she ripped the jaw-bone from his head and tossed\nit clattering away. His tongue lolled inside a ragged mass of dusty flesh.\n'Say your prayers, Eater,' she hissed, 'and hope that God is merciful.' She\nclamped her palms around either side of his head. A long squeak came from his\nnose. His shattered hand pawed at her, uselessly. His skull bent, then flattened, then\nburst apart, splinters of bone flying. She let the body fall, dust sliding out across the\nfloor, curling round her feet.\n'Yes…'\nShe did not startle. She did not stare. She knew where the voice came from.\nEverywhere and nowhere.\nShe stepped to the window and pulled it open. She jumped through, dropped a\ndozen strides down to the turf, and stood. The night was full of sounds, but she was\nsilent. She padded across the moonlit grass, crunching frozen where her bare feet\nfell, crept up a long stair and onto the walls. The voices followed her.\n'Wait.'\n'The Seed!'\n'Ferro.'\n'Let us in…'\nShe ignored them. An armoured man stared out into the night, out towards the\nHouse of the Maker, a blacker outline against the black sky. A wedge of darkness\nover the Agriont within which there were no stars, no moonlit clouds, no light at all.\nFerro wondered if Tolomei was lurking in the shadows inside, scratching at its gates.\nScratching, scratching, forever. She had wasted her chance at vengeance.\nFerro would not do the same.\nShe slid down the battlements, around the guard, hugging his cloak tight about his\nshoulders as she passed.

When she\nhad buried the great Uthman-ul-Dosht in the ruins of his own palace. When she had\nsent Khalul, and his Eaters, and his priests to hell.

Two hundred of\nthem or more, sitting in a muttering crowd around the opposite side of the room.\nTheir false talk, and their false smiles, and their false faces cloyed at him like too\nmuch honey.

There was a fat man with a face full of broken veins,\nlooked as if he started each day with a bottle. There was a tall, lean bastard in a\nblack breastplate covered in fancy gold, with a soft smile and hard little eyes. As\nshifty a pack of liars as Logen had ever laid eyes on, but there was one worse than\nall the rest together.\nBayaz sat with an easy grin on his face, as if everything had turned out just the\nway he'd planned. Maybe it had. Damn wizard. Logen should have known better\nthan to trust a man with no hair. The spirits had warned him that Magi have their own\npurposes, but he'd taken no notice, plunged on blindly, hoping for the best, just like\nalways.

She had a frosty\npride about her, maybe, but no worse for that. Beautiful as a winter morning. And\nshe had this look on her face, when she looked at Jezal. A fierce kind of look, as if\nshe could hardly stop herself tearing into him with her teeth. That lucky bastard\nalways seemed to come out alright. She could've had a little bite out of Logen if\nshe'd wanted, but what woman in her right mind did?\nHe frowned most of all at himself in the mirrors opposite, raised up on the high\nplatform beside Jezal and his queen. He looked a sullen and brooding, scarred and\nfearsome monster beside that beautiful pair. A man made of murder, then swaddled\nin rich coloured cloth and rare white furs, set with polished rivets and bright buckles,\nall topped off with a great golden chain around his shoulders. That same chain that\nBethod had worn. His hands stuck from the ends of his fur-trimmed sleeves, marked\nand brutal, one finger missing, grasping at the arms of his gilded chair. King's\nclothes, maybe, but killer's hands. He looked like the villain in some old children's\nstory. The ruthless warrior, clawed his way to power with fire and steel. Climbed to\na throne up a mountain of corpses. Maybe he was that man.\nHe squirmed around, new cloth scratching at his clammy skin. He'd come a long\nway, since he dragged himself out of a river without even a pair of boots to his\nname. Dragged himself across the High Places with nothing but a pot for company.\nHe'd come a long way, but he wasn't sure he hadn't liked himself better before. He'd\nlaughed when he'd heard that Bethod was calling himself a king. Now here he was,\ndoing the same, and even worse suited to the job. Say one thing for Logen\nNinefingers, say he's a cunt. Simple as that. And that's not something any man likes\nto admit about himself.\nThe drunkard, Hoff, was doing most of the talking. 'The Lords' Round lies in\nruins, alas. For the time being, therefore, until a venue of grandeur suitable for this\nnoble institution has been built—a new Lords' Round, richer and greater than the\nlast—it has been decided that the Open Council will stand in recess.'\nThere was a pause. 'In recess?' someone muttered.\n'How will we be heard?'\n'Where will the nobles have their voice?'\n'The nobles will speak through the Closed Council.' Hoff had that tone a man\nuses talking down to a child. 'Or may apply to the Undersecretary for Audiences to\nobtain a hearing with the king.'\n'But any peasant may do so!'\nHoff raised his eyebrows. 'True.'\nA ripple of anger spread out through the Lords in front of them. Logen might not\nhave understood too much about politics, but he could recognise one set of men\ngetting stood on by another. Never a nice thing to be part of, but at least he was on\nthe side doing the standing, for once."

The cripple licked at his empty gums with a faint sucking sound.\n'From each one of you.'\n'This will not stand!' shouted an angry old man in the front row.\n'You think not, Lord Isher?' Bayaz only smiled at him. 'Those who do not think\nso may join Lord Brock in dusty exile, and surrender all their lands to the crown\ninstead of just a portion.'\n'This is an outrage!' shouted another man. 'Always, the king has been first among\nequals, the greatest of nobles, not above them. Our votes brought him to the throne,\nand we refuse—'\n'You dance close to a line, Lord Heugen.' The cripple's face twitched with ugly\nspasms as he frowned across the room. 'You might wish to remain on that side of it,\nwhere it is safe, and warm, and loyal. The other side will not suit you so well, I\nthink.' A long tear ran from his flickering left eye and down his hollow cheek. 'The\nSurveyor General will be assessing your estates over the coming months. It would\nbe wise for you all to lend him your fullest assistance.'\nA lot of men were on their feet now, scowling, shaking fists. 'This is outrageous!'\n'Unprecedented!'\n'Unacceptable!'\n'We refuse to be intimidated!'\nJezal sprang from his throne, raising his jewelled sword high, and struck at the\nplatform again and again with the end of the scabbard, filling the room with booming\nechoes. 'I am the king!' he bellowed at the suddenly silent chamber. 'I am not\noffering a choice, I am issuing a royal decree! Adua will be rebuilt, and more\nglorious than ever! This is the price! You have grown too used to a weak crown, my\nLords! Believe me when I say that those days are now behind us!'\nBayaz leaned sideways to mutter in Logen's ear. 'Surprisingly good at this, isn't\nhe?'\nThe Lords grumbled, but they sat back down as Jezal spoke on, voice washing\naround the room with easy confidence, sheathed sword still held firmly in one fist.\n'Those who lent me their wholehearted support in the recent crisis will be exempt.\nBut that list, to your shame, is all too brief. Why, it was friends from outside the\nborders of the Union who sustained us in our time of need!'\nThe man in black swept from his chair. 'I, Orso of Talins, stand always at the\nside of my royal son and daughter!' He seized Jezal's face and kissed both his\ncheeks. Then he did the same with the queen. 'Their friends are my friends.' He said\nit with a smile, but the meaning was hard to miss. 'Their enemies? Ah! You all are\nclever men. You can guess the rest.'"

He folded\nJezal in a hug, slapped him on the back with a thump that echoed round the great\nchamber. 'Reckon we'll be staying our side of the Whiteflow from now on. Unless\nmy brother has trouble down here, of course.' He swept the sullen old men in the\nfront row with a graveyard scowl. 'Don't make me fucking come back here.' He sat\ndown in the big chair and frowned out. The Bloody-Nine might not have known too\nmuch about politics, but he knew how to make a threat alright.\n'We won the war!'

'I understand that you rarely sleep in the same room.'\nJezal was on the point of giving the cripple a backhanded blow across the face\nfor his impudence.

'She can scarcely stand to be in the same country as me, let alone\nthe same bed. The woman's an utter bitch!' he snarled, then hung his head and stared\ndown at the floor. 'What am I to do?'\nGlokta worked his neck to one side, then the other, and Jezal suppressed a\nshudder as he heard a loud click. 'Let me speak to the queen, your Majesty. I can be\nquite persuasive when I have the mind. I understand your difficulties. I am myself\nbut recently married.'\nJezal dreaded to think what manner of monster might have accepted this monster\nas a husband. 'Truly?' he asked, feigning interest.

The room was empty, neat and clean, as though no one had ever\nslept there. Ferro was gone.\nNothing had worked out the way he'd hoped. He should've expected it by now,\nmaybe.

A man can't do the\nthings he'd done, and hope for happy endings.\nHe strode out into the corridor and down the hallway, his jaw clenched. He\nshouldered open the next door without knocking. The tall windows stood open,\nsunlight pouring into the airy room, hangings stirring in the breeze. Bayaz sat in a\ncarved chair in front of one of them, a teacup in his hand. A fawning servant in a\nvelvet jacket was pouring into it from a silver pot, a tray and cups balanced on his\noutspread fingertips.\n'Ah, the King of the Northmen!' called Bayaz. 'How are—'\n'Where is Ferro?'\n'Gone. She left something of a mess behind, in fact, but I have tidied up, as I so\noften find myself—'\n'Where?'\nThe Magus shrugged. 'South, I would imagine. Vengeance, or some such, if I\nwas forced to guess. She always said a very great deal about vengeance. A most\nill-tempered woman.'\n'She is changed.'\n'Great events, my friend. None of us are quite the same. Now, will you take tea?'\nThe servant pranced forward, silver tray bobbing. Logen seized him by his velvet\njacket and flung him across the room. He squealed as he crashed into the wall and\nsprawled on the carpet, cups clattering around him.\nBayaz raised an eyebrow. 'A simple \"no\" would have sufficed.'\n'Shit on that, you old bastard.'\nThe First of the Magi frowned. 'Why, Master Ninefingers, you seem in bullish\nmood this morning. You are a king now, and it ill becomes you to let your baser\npassions rule you in this manner. Kings of that sort never last. You have enemies still\nin the North. Calder and Scale, up in the hills causing trouble, I am sure. Manners\nshould be repaid by like manners, I have always thought. You have been helpful to\nme, and I can be helpful in return.'\n'As you were to Bethod?'\n'Just so.'\n'Much good it did him.'\n'When he had my help, he prospered.

Did I not buy your life from Bethod? Did I not give you\npurpose when you had nothing? Did I not take you to the very edge of the World,\nshow you wonders few men have seen? These are poor manners. Why, the very\nsword with which you threaten me was my gift to you. I had hoped we might come\nto a—'\n'No.'\n'I see. Not even—'\n'We are done. Looks as if I'll never be a better man, but I can try not to be a\nworse. I can try that much, at least.'\nBayaz narrowed his eyes. 'Well, Master Ninefingers, you surprise me to the last. I\nthought you a courageous yet restrained man, a calculating yet compassionate one. I\nthought you, above all, a realistic man. But the Northmen have ever been prone to\npetulance. I observe in you now an obstinate streak and a destructive temper. I see\nthe Bloody-Nine at last.'\n'I'm happy to disappoint you. Seems we misjudged each other entirely. I took\nyou for a great man. Now I realise my mistake.' Logen slowly shook his head. 'What\nhave you done here?'\n'What have I done?' Bayaz snorted with disbelieving laughter. 'I combined three\npure disciplines of magic, and I forged a new one! It seems you do not understand\nthe achievement, Master Ninefingers, but I forgive you. I realise that book-learning\nhas never been your strongest suit. Such a thing has not been contemplated since\nbefore the Old Time, when Euz split his gifts among his sons.' Bayaz sighed. 'None\nwill appreciate my greatest achievement, it seems. None except Khalul, perhaps, and\nit is unlikely he will ever proffer his congratulations. Why, such power has not been\nreleased within the Circle of the World since… since…'\n'Glustrod destroyed himself and Aulcus with him?'\nThe Magus raised his eyebrows. 'Since you mention it.'\n'And the results are pretty much the same, it seems to me, except you wrought a\ntouch less careless slaughter, and ruined a smaller part of a smaller city, in a smaller,\nmeaner time. Otherwise what's the difference, between you and him?'\n'I would have thought that was entirely obvious.' Bayaz lifted his teacup, gazing\nmildly over the rim. 'Glustrod lost.'\nLogen stood there for a long while, thinking on that. Then he turned and stalked\nfrom the room, the servant cringing out of his way. Into the corridor, footsteps\nclapping from the gilded ceiling, Bethod's heavy chain jingling round his shoulders\nlike laughter in his ear.\nHe probably should've kept the ruthless old bastard on his side.

Chances were\nthat Logen would need his help, the way things were like to be in the North, once he\ngot back. He probably should've sucked up that stinking piss he called tea and\nsmiled as if it was honey. He probably should've laughed, and called Bayaz old\nfriend, so he could come crawling to the Great Northern Library when things turned\nsour. That would have been the clever thing to do. That would have been the realistic\nthing. But it was just the way that Logen's father had always said…\nHe'd never been that realistic.\nBehind the Throne\n« ^ »\nA soon as he heard the door open, Jezal knew who his visitor must be. He did not\neven have to look up. Who else would have the temerity to barge into a king's own\nchambers without so much as knocking? He cursed, silently, but with great\nbitterness.\nIt could only be Bayaz. His jailer. His chief tormentor. His ever-present shadow.\nThe man who had destroyed half the Agriont, and made a ruin of beautiful Adua,\nand now smiled and revelled in the applause as though he were the saviour of the\nnation. It was enough to make a man sick to the pit of his guts. Jezal ground his\nteeth, staring out of the window towards the ruins, refusing to turn round.\nMore demands. More compromises. More talk of what had to be done. Being the\nhead of state, at least with the First of the Magi at his shoulder, was an endlessly\nfrustrating and disempowering experience. Getting his own way on even the tiniest of\nissues, an almost impossible struggle. Wherever he looked he found himself staring\ndirectly into the Magus' disapproving frown. He felt like nothing more than a\nfigurehead. A fine-looking, a gilded, a magnificent yet utterly useless chunk of wood.\nExcept a figurehead at least gets to go at the front of the ship.\n'Your Majesty,' came the old man's voice, the usual thin veneer of respect\nscarcely concealing the hard body of disdain beneath.\n'What now?' Jezal finally turned to face him. He was surprised to see that the\nMagus had shed his robes of state in favour of his old travel-stained coat, the heavy\nboots he had worn on their ill-fated journey into the ruined west. 'Going\nsomewhere?' asked Jezal, hardly daring even to hope.\n'I am leaving Adua. Today.'\n'Today?' It was the most Jezal could do to stop himself leaping in the air and\nscreaming for joy. He felt like a prisoner stepping from his stinking dungeon and into\nthe bright sunlight of freedom. Now he could rebuild the Agriont as he saw fit. He\ncould reorganise the Closed Council, pick his own advisers. Perhaps even rid\nhimself of that witch of a wife Bayaz had saddled him with. He would be free to do\nthe right thing, whatever that was. He would be free to try and find out what the right\nthing might be, at least. Was he not the High King of the Union, after all? Who would"

Who would\nrefuse him? 'We will be sorry to lose you, of course.'\n'I can imagine. There are some arrangements that we must make first, however.'\n'By all means.' Anything if it meant he was rid of the old bastard.\n'I have spoken with your new Arch Lector, Glokta.'\nThe name alone produced a shiver of revulsion. 'Have you indeed?'\n'A sharp man. He has greatly impressed me. I have asked him to speak in my\nstead while I am absent from the Closed Council.'\n'Truly?' asked Jezal, wondering whether to toss the cripple from his post directly\nafter the Magus left the gates or to leave it a day.\n'I would recommend,' said in very much the tone of an order, 'that you listen\nclosely to his opinions.'\n'Oh I will, of course. The best of luck on your journey back to…'\n'I would like you, in fact, to do as he says.'\nA cold knot of anger pressed at Jezal's throat. 'You would have me, in effect…\nobey him?'\nBayaz' eyes did not deviate from his own. 'In effect… yes.'\nJezal was left momentarily speechless. For the Magus to suppose that he could\ncome and go as he pleased, leaving his maimed lackey in charge? Above a king, in\nhis own kingdom? The overwhelming arrogance of the man! 'You have taken a high\nhand of late in my affairs!' he snapped. 'I am in no mind to trade one overbearing\nadviser for another.'\n'That man will be very useful to you. To us. Decisions will have to be made that\nyou would find difficult. Actions will have to be taken which you would rather not\ntake yourself. People who would live in sparkling palaces need others willing to carry\naway their ordure, lest it pile up in the polished corridors and one day bury them. All\nthis is simple, and obvious. You have not attended to me.'\n'No! You are the one who has failed to attend! Sand dan Glokta? That crippled\nbastard…' he realised his unfortunate choice of words, but had to forge on\nregardless, growing angrier than ever, 'sitting beside me at the Closed Council?\nLeering over my shoulder every day of my life? And now you would have him\ndictate to me? Unacceptable. Insufferable. Impossible! We are no longer in the time\nof Harod the Great! I have no notion of what causes you to suppose that you could\nspeak to me in such a manner. I am king here, and I refuse to be steered!'\nBayaz closed his eyes, and drew a slow breath threw his nose. Quite as though he\nwere trying to find the patience for the education of a moron. 'You cannot\nunderstand what it is to live as long as I have. To know all that I know. You people\nare dead in the blink of an eye, and have to be taught the same old lessons all over\nagain. The same lessons that Juvens taught Stolicus a thousand years ago. It\nbecomes extremely tiresome.'"

Your wit is so very sharp I hardly noticed I was cut.'\n'You mock me!'\n'It is easily done. Every man seems a child to me. When you reach my age you\nsee that history moves in circles. So many times I have guided this nation back from\nthe brink of destruction, and on to ever greater glory. And what do I ask in return? A\nfew little sacrifices? If you only understood the sacrifices that I have made on behalf\nof you cattle!'\nJezal stabbed one finger furiously towards the window. 'And what of all those\ndead? What of all those who have lost everything? Those cattle, as you put it! Are\nthey happy with their sacrifices, do you suppose? What of all those who have\nsuffered from this illness? That still suffer? My own close friend among them! I\ncannot but notice it seems similar to that illness you described to us in ruined\nAulcus. I cannot help thinking that your magic might be the cause!'\nThe Magus made no effort to deny it. 'I deal in the momentous. I cannot concern\nmyself with the fate of every peasant. Neither can you. I have tried to teach you this,\nbut it seems you have failed to learn the lesson.'\n'You are mistaken! I refuse to learn it!' Now was his chance. Now, while he was\nangry enough, for Jezal to step forever from the shadow of the First of the Magi and\nstand a free man. Bayaz was poison, and he had to be cut out. 'You helped me to\nmy throne, and for that I thank you. But I do not care for your brand of government,\nit smacks of tyranny!'\nBayaz narrowed his eyes. 'Government is tyranny. At its best it is dressed in\npretty colours.'\n'Your callous disregard for the lives of my subjects! I will not stand for it! I have\nmoved beyond you. You are no longer wanted here. No longer needed. I will find\nmy own way from now on.' He waved Bayaz away with what he hoped was a regal\ngesture of dismissal. 'You may leave.'\n'May… I… indeed?' The First of the Magi stood in silence for a long time, his\nfrown growing darker and darker. Long enough for Jezal's rage to begin to wilt, for\nhis mouth to go dry, for his knees to feel weak. 'I perceive that I have been far too\nsoft with you,' said Bayaz, each word sharp as a razor-cut. 'I have coddled you, like\na favourite grandchild, and you have grown wilful. A mistake that I shall not make\nagain. A responsible guardian should never be shy with the whip.'\n'I am a son of kings!' snarled Jezal, 'I will not—'\nHe was doubled over by a spear of pain through his guts, stunningly sudden.

He crashed onto his\nface, scarcely able even to breathe, his crown bouncing off and rolling away into the\ncorner of the room. He had never known agony like it. Not a fraction of it.\n'I have no notion… of what causes you to suppose… that you could speak to me\nin such a manner. To me, the First of the Magi!' Jezal heard Bayaz' footsteps\nthumping slowly towards him, voice picking at his ears as he squirmed helplessly in\nhis own sick.\n'Son of kings? I am disappointed, after all that we have been through together,\nthat you would so readily believe the lies I have spread on your behalf. That\nnonsense was meant for the idiots in the streets, but it seems that idiots in palaces\nare lulled by sweet slop just as easily. I bought you from a whore. You cost me six\nmarks. She wanted twenty, but I drive a hard bargain.'\nThe words were painful, of course. But far, far worse was the unbearable\nstabbing that cut up Jezal's spine, that tore at his eyes, burned his skin, seared the\nvery roots of his hair and made him thrash like a frog in boiling water.\n'I had others waiting, of course. I know better than to trust all to one throw of the\ndice. Other sons of mysterious parentage, ready to step into the role. There was a\nfamily called Brint, as I recall, and plenty more besides. But you floated to the top,\nJezal, like a turd in the bath. When I crossed that bridge into the Agriont and saw\nyou grown, I knew you were the one. You simply looked right, and you can't teach\nthat. You have even come to speak like a king, which is a bonus I never expected.'\nJezal moaned and slobbered, unable even to scream. He felt Bayaz' boot slide\nunder him and kick him over onto his back. The Magus' scowling face loomed down\ntowards him, blurred by tears.\n'But if you insist on being difficult… if you insist on going your own way… well,\nthere are other options. Even kings die unexplained deaths. Thrown by a horse.\nChoked on an olive-pit. Long falls to the hard, hard cobble-stones. Or simply found\ndead in the morning. Life is always short for you insects. But it can be very short for\nthose who are not useful. I made you out of nothing. Out of air. With a word I can\nunmake you.' Bayaz snapped his fingers, and the sound was like a sword through\nJezal's stomach. 'Like that you can be replaced.'\nThe First of the Magi leaned down further. 'Now, dolt, bastard, son of a whore,\nconsider carefully your answers to these questions. You will do as your Arch Lector\nadvises, yes?'\nThe cramps relaxed a merciful fraction. Enough for Jezal to whisper, yes.\n'You will be guided by him in all things?'\n'Yes.'\n'You will abide by his orders, in public and in private?'\n'Yes,' he gasped, 'yes.'\n'Good,' said the Magus, straightening up, towering over Jezal as his statue had"

I trust that this is one lesson you will not\nignore.' The agony ebbed suddenly away. Enough for Jezal to lift his spinning head\nfrom the tiles.\n'I hate you,' he managed to croak.\nBayaz spluttered with laughter. 'Hate me? The arrogance of you! To suppose that\nI might care. I, Bayaz, first apprentice of great Juvens! I, who threw down the\nMaster Maker, who forged the Union, who destroyed the Hundred Words!' The\nMagus slowly lifted his foot and planted it on the side of Jezal's jaw. 'I don't care\nwhether you like me, fool.' He ground Jezal's face into the vomit-spattered floor with\nhis boot. 'I care that you obey. And you will. Yes?'\n'Yes,' Jezal slobbered through his squashed mouth.\n'Then, your Majesty, I take my leave. Pray that you never give me cause to\nreturn.' The crushing pressure on his face released and Jezal heard the Magus'\nfootsteps tap away to the far side of the room. The door creaked open, and then\nclicked firmly shut.\nHe lay on his back, staring at the ceiling, his breath heaving quickly in and out.\nAfter a while he drew up the courage to roll over, dragged himself dizzily up to his\nhands and knees. There was an unpleasant stink, and not just from the vomit\nsmeared across his face. He realised with a meagre flicker of shame that he had\nsoiled himself. He crawled across to the window, still limp as a wrung-out rag, drew\nhimself gasping up to his knees, and looked down into the chilly gardens.\nIt only took a moment for Bayaz to come into view, striding down the gravel path\nbetween the neat lawns, the back of his bald pate shining. Yoru Sulfur walked behind\nhim, staff in one hand, a box of dark metal held under the other arm. The same box\nthat had followed Jezal, and Logen, and Ferro in a cart across half the Circle of the\nWorld. What happy days those seemed now.\nBayaz stopped, suddenly, turned, raised his head. He looked up, straight towards\nthe window.\nJezal pressed himself into the hangings with a whimper of terror, his whole body\ntrembling, the after-image of that unbearable pain still stamped, cold as ice, into his\nguts. The First of the Magi stood there for a moment longer, the faintest hint of a\nsmile on his face. Then he turned away smartly, strode between the bowing Knights\nof the Body flanking the gate, and was gone.\nJezal knelt there, clinging to the curtains like a child to his mother.

Never in\nhis life had he felt so alone. Son of Kings? He had no one and nothing. He spluttered\nand sniffed. His vision grew blurry. He shook with hopeless sobs, his scarred lip\ntrembling, the tears dripping down and spattering on the tiles.\nHe wept with pain and fear, with shame and anger, with disappointment and\nhelplessness.

So most of all he wept\nwith relief.\nGood Men, Evil Men\n« ^ »\nGrey morning time, out in the cold, wet gardens, and the Dogman was just stood\nthere, thinking about how things used to be better. Stood there, in the middle of that\ncircle of brown graves, staring at the turned earth over Harding Grim. Strange, how a\nman who said so little could leave such a hole.\nIt was a long journey that Dogman had taken, the last few years, and a strange\none. From nowhere to nowhere, and he'd lost a lot of friends along the way. He\nremembered all those men gone back to the mud. Harding Grim. Tul Duru\nThunderhead. Rudd Threetrees. Forley the Weakest. And what for? Who was better\noff because of it? All that waste. It was enough to make a man sick to the soles of\nhis boots. Even one who was famous for having a flat temper. All gone, and left\nDogman lonely. The world was a narrower place without 'em.\nHe heard footsteps through the wet grass. Logen, walking up through the misty\nrain, breath smoking round his scarred face. Dogman remembered how happy he'd\nbeen, that night, when Logen had stepped into the firelight, still alive. It had seemed\nlike a new beginning, then. A good moment, promising better times. Hadn't quite\nworked out that way. Strange, how the Dogman didn't feel so happy at the sight of\nLogen Ninefingers no more.\n'The King o' the Northmen,' he muttered. 'The Bloody-Nine. How's the day?'\n'Wet is how it is. Getting late in the year.'\n'Aye. Another winter coming.' Dogman picked at the hard skin on his palm. 'They\ncome quicker and quicker.'\n'Reckon it's high time I got back to the North, eh? Calder and Scale still loose,\nmaking mischief, and the dead know what type o' trouble Dow's cooked up.'\n'Aye, I daresay. High time we left.'\n'I want you to stay.'\nDogman looked up. 'Eh?'\n'Someone needs to talk to the Southerners, make a deal. You've always been the\nbest man I knew for talking.

'Dow been talking, has he?'\n'Never mind who said what. Did you kill the Thunderhead or did you not? Ain't a\nhard one to come at. It's just a yes or a no.'\nLogen made a kind of snort, like he was about to start laughing, or about to start\ncrying, but didn't do either one. 'I don't know what I did.'\n'Don't know? What use is don't know? Is that what you'll say after you've\nstabbed me through the back, while I'm trying to save your worthless life?'\nLogen winced down at the wet grass. 'Maybe it will be. I don't know.' His eyes\nslid back up to the Dogman's, and stuck there, hard. 'But that's the price, ain't it?\nYou know what I am. You could have picked a different man to follow.'\nDogman watched him go, not knowing what to say, not knowing what to think\neven. Just standing there, in the midst of the graves, getting wetter. He felt someone\ncome up beside him. Red Hat, looking off into the rain, watching after Logen's black\nshape growing fainter and fainter. He shook his head, mouth pursed up tight.\n'I never believed the stories they told about him. About the Bloody-Nine. All\nbluster, I thought. But I believe 'em now. I heard he killed Crummock's boy, in that\nfight in the mountains. Carved him careless as you'd crush a beetle, no reason.\nThat's a man there cares for nothing. No man worse, I reckon, ever, in all the North.\nNot even Bethod. That's an evil bastard, if ever there was one.'\n'That so?' Dogman found he was right up in Red Hat's face, and shouting. 'Well\npiss on you, arsehole! Who made you the fucking judge?'\n'Just saying, is all.' Red Hat stared at him. 'I mean… I thought we had the same\nthing in mind.'\n'Well, we don't!

He tried to turn over, winced at a\nclick in his neck. Ah, the first spasm of the day. The second was not long coming. It\nflashed through his left hip as he wrestled his way onto his back and snatched his\nbreath away. The pain crept down his spine, settled in his leg, and stayed there.\n'Ah,' he grunted. He tried, ever so gently, to turn his ankle round, to work his\nknee. The pain instantly grew far worse. 'Barnam!' He dragged the sheet to one side\nand the familiar stink of ordure rose up to his nostrils. Nothing like the stench of\nyour own dung to usher in a productive morning.\n'Ah! Barnam!' He whimpered, and slobbered, and clutched at his withered thigh,\nbut nothing helped. The pain grew worse, and worse. The fibres started from his\nwasted flesh like metal cables, toeless foot flopping grotesquely on the end, entirely\nbeyond his control.\n'Barnam!' he screamed. 'Barnam, you fucker! The door!' Spit dribbled from his\ntoothless mouth, tears ran down his twitching face, his hands clawed, clutching up\nFistfuls of brown-stained sheet.\nHe heard hurried footsteps in the corridor, the lock scraping. 'Locked you fool!'\nhe squealed through his gums, thrashing with pain and anger. The knob turned and\nthe door opened, much to his surprise. What the…\nArdee hurried over to the bed. 'Get out!' he hissed, holding one arm pointlessly\nover his face, clutching at his bedclothes with the other. 'Get out!'\n'No.' She tore the sheet away and Glokta grimaced, waiting for her face to go\npale, waiting for her to stagger back, one hand across her mouth, eyes wide with\nshock and disgust.

Her hands slid\nslowly over his withered flesh, gentle, but firm, rubbing at the scarred skin, pressing\nat the ruined muscles. How long ago? Since a woman looked at me with anything\nbut horror? Since a woman touched me with anything but violence? He lay back,\nhis eyes closed and his mouth open, tears running from his eye and trickling down\nthe sides of his head into the pillow. Almost comfortable. Almost…\n'I don't deserve this,' he breathed.\n'No one gets what they deserve.'\nQueen Terez looked down her nose at Glokta as he lurched into her sunny salon,\nwithout the slightest attempt to hide her utter disgust and contempt. As though she\nsaw a cockroach crawling into her regal presence. But we will see. We know well\nthe path, after all. We have followed it ourselves, and we have dragged so many\nothers after. Pride comes first. Then pain. Humility follows hard upon it.\nObedience lies just beyond.\n'My name is Glokta. I am the new Arch Lector of his Majesty's Inquisition.'\n'Ah, the cripple,' she sneered. With refreshing directness. And why do you\ndisrupt my afternoon? You will find no criminals here.' Only Styrian witches."

Only Styrian witches.\nGlokta's eyes flickered to the other woman, standing bolt upright near one of the\nwindows. 'It is a matter we had better discuss alone.'\n'The Countess Shalere has been my friend since birth. There is nothing you can\nsay to me that she cannot hear.' The Countess glared at Glokta with a disdain little\nless piercing than the queen's.\n'Very well.' No delicate way to say it. I doubt that delicacy will serve us here in\nany case. 'It has come to my attention, your Majesty, that you have not been\nperforming your duties as a wife.'\nTerez' long, thin neck seemed to stretch with indignation. 'How dare you? That is\nnone of your concern!'\n'I am afraid that it is. Heirs for the king, you see. The future of the state, and so\nforth.'\n'This is insufferable!' The queen's face was white with fury. The Jewel of Talins\nflashes fire indeed. 'I must eat your repulsive food, I must tolerate your dreadful\nweather, I must smile at the rambling mutterings of your idiot king! Now I must\nanswer to his grotesque underlings? I am kept prisoner here!'\nGlokta looked round at the beautiful room. The opulent hangings, the gilt\nfurnishings, the fine paintings. The two beautiful women in their beautiful clothes. He\ndug one tooth sourly into the underside of his tongue. 'Believe me. This is not what a\nprison looks like.'\n'There are many kinds of prison!'\n'I have learned to live with worse, and so have others.' You should see what my\nwife has to put up with.\n'To share my bed with some disgusting bastard, some scarred son of who knows\nwhat, to have some stinking, hairy man pawing at me in the night!' The queen gave a\nshiver of revulsion. 'It is not to be borne!'\nTears shone in her eyes. Her lady-in-waiting rushed forward, dress rustling, and\nknelt beside her, putting a comforting hand on her shoulder. Terez reached up,\npressed her own hand on top of it. The queen's companion stared at Glokta with\nnaked hatred. 'Get out! Out, cripple, and never come back! You have upset her\nMajesty!'\n'I have a gift for it,' muttered Glokta. 'One reason why I am so widely hated…'\nHe trailed off, frowning. He stared at their two hands on Terez' shoulder. There was\nsomething in that touch. Comforting, soothing, protective. The touch of the\ncommitted friend, the trusted confidante, the sisterly companion. But there is more\nthan that. Too familiar. Too warm. Almost like the touch of… Ah.\n'You don't have much use for men, do you?'\nThe two women looked up at him together, then Shalere snatched her hand away\nfrom the queen's shoulder. 'I will have your meaning!' barked Terez, but her voice\nwas shrill, almost panicked.\n'I think you know my meaning well enough.' And my task is made a great deal"

And my task is made a great deal\neasier. 'Some help here!' Two hulking Practicals barged through the doors. And as\nquickly as that, everything is changed. Amazing, the spice that two big men can\nadd to a conversation. Some kinds of power are only tricks of the mind. I learned\nthat well, in the Emperor's prisons, and my new master has only reinforced the\nlesson.\n'You would not dare!' shrieked Terez, staring at the masked arrivals with wide\neyes. 'You would not dare to touch me!'\n'As luck would have it, I doubt it will be necessary, but we will see.' He pointed\nat the Countess. 'Seize that woman.'\nThe two black-masked men tramped across the thick carpet. One moved a chair\nout of his way with exaggerated care.\n'No!' The queen sprang up, grabbing Shalere's hand in hers. 'No!'\n'Yes,' said Glokta.\nThe two women backed away, clinging to each other, Terez in front, shielding the\nCountess with her body, teeth bared in a warning snarl as the two great shadows\napproached. One might almost be touched by their evident care for one another, if\none was capable of being touched at all. 'Take her. But no marks on the queen, if\nyou please.'\n'No!' screamed Terez. 'I'll have your heads for this! My father… my father is—'\n'On his way back to Talins, and I doubt he'll be starting a war over your friend\nsince birth, in any case. You are bought and paid for, and Duke Orso does not strike\nme as the type to renege on a deal.'\nThe two men and the two women lurched around the far end of the room in an\nungainly dance. One of the Practicals seized the Countess by one wrist, dragged her\naway from the queen's clutching hand and forced her down onto her knees, twisting\nher arms behind her, snapping heavy irons shut on her wrists. Terez shrieked,\npunched, kicked, clawed at the other, but she might as well have vented her fury on a\ntree. The huge man barely moved, his eyes every bit as emotionless as the mask\nbelow them.\nGlokta found that he was almost smiling as he watched the ugly scene. I may be\ncrippled, and hideous, and in constant pain, but the humiliation of beautiful\nwomen is one pleasure I can still enjoy. I do it now with threats and violence,\ninstead of with soft words and entreaties, but still. Almost as much fun as it ever\nwas.\nOne of the Practicals forced a canvas bag over Shalere's head, turning her cries\nto muffled sobs, then marched her helplessly across the room. The other stayed\nwhere he was for a moment, keeping the queen herded into the corner. Then he\nbacked off towards the door. On his way he picked up the chair he had moved and\ncarefully put it back exactly as he had found it.\n'Curse you!' Terez screeched, her clenched fists trembling as the door clicked"

'Curse you, you twisted bastard! If you harm\nher—'\n'It will not come to that. Because you have the means of her deliverance well\nwithin your grasp.'\nThe queen swallowed, chest heaving. 'What must I do?'\n'Fuck.' The word somehow sounded twice as ugly in the beautiful surroundings.\n'And bear children. I will give the Countess seven days in the darkness, unmolested.\nIf, at the end of that time, I do not hear that you have set the king's cock on fire\nevery night, I will introduce her to my Practicals. Poor fellows. They get so little\nexercise. Ten minutes each should do the trick, but there are plenty of them, in the\nHouse of Questions. I daresay we can keep your childhood friend quite busy night\nand day.'\nA spasm of horror passed over Terez' face. And why not? This is a low chapter\neven for me. 'If I do as you ask?'\n'Then the Countess will be kept quite safe and sound. Once you are verifiably\nwith child, I will return her to you. Things can be as they are now, during the period\nof your confinement. Two boys, as heirs, two girls, to marry off, and we can be\ndone with one another. The king can find his entertainment elsewhere.'\n'But, that will take years!'\n'You could get it done in three or four, if you really ride him hard. And you might\nfind it makes everyone's lives easier if you at least pretend to enjoy it.'\n'Pretend?' she breathed.\n'The more you seem to like it, the quicker it will be over. The cheapest whore on\nthe docks can squeal for her coppers when the sailors stick her. Are you telling me\nyou cannot squeal for the king of the Union? You offend my patriotic sensibilities!\nUh!' he gasped, rolling his eyes in a parody of ecstasy. 'Ah! Yes! Just there! Don't\nstop!' He curled his lip at her. 'You see? Even I can do it! A liar of your experience\nshould have no difficulty.'\nHer teary eyes darted round the room, as though she were looking for some way\nout. But there is none. The noble Arch Lector Glokta, protector of the Union, great\nheart of the Closed Council, paragon of the gentlemanly virtues, displays his flair\nfor politics and diplomacy. He felt some tiny stirring within him as he watched her\nwretched desperation, some negligible flutter in his guts. Guilt, perhaps? Or\nindigestion? It hardly matters which, I have learned my lesson. Pity never works\nfor me.\nHe took one more slow step forward. 'Your Majesty, I hope you fully understand\nthe alternative.'\nShe nodded, and wiped her eyes. Then she proudly raised up her chin. 'I will do\nas you ask. Please, I beg of you, do not hurt her… please…'\nPlease, please, please. Many congratulations, your Eminence. 'You have my\nword. I will see the Countess has only the best of treatment.' He licked gently at the\nsour gaps in his teeth. 'And you will do the same with your husband.'"

'And you will do the same with your husband.'\nJezal sat in the darkness. He watched the fire dance in the great hearth, and he\nthought about what might have been. He thought about it with some bitterness. All\nthe paths his life could have taken, and he had ended up here. Alone.\nHe heard hinges creaking. The small door that connected to the queen's\nbedchamber crept slowly open. He had never bothered to lock it, from his side. He\nhad not foreseen any circumstance under which she would ever want to use it. Some\nerror of etiquette that he had made, no doubt, for which she could not wait even until\nmorning to admonish him.\nHe stood up, quickly, stupidly nervous.\nTerez stepped through the shadowy doorway. She looked so different that at first\nhe hardly recognised her. Her hair was loose, she wore only her shift. She looked\nhumbly towards the ground, her face in darkness. Her bare feet padded across the\nboards, across the thick carpet towards the fire. She seemed very young, suddenly.\nYoung and small, weak and alone. He watched her, mostly confused, somewhat\nscared, but also, as she came closer and the firelight caught the shape of her body,\never so slightly aroused.\n'Terez, my…' he fumbled for the word. Darling scarcely seemed to cover it. Nor\ndid love. Worst enemy might have, but it hardly would have helped matters. 'Can\nI—'\nShe cut him off, as ever, but not with the tirade he was expecting. 'I'm sorry for\nthe way that I have treated you. For the things that I have said… you must think\nme…'\nThere were tears in her eyes. Actual tears. He would hardly have believed until\nthat moment that she could cry. He took a hurried step or two towards her, one hand\nout, no idea of what to do. He had never dared to hope for an apology, and certainly\nnot one so earnestly and honestly delivered.\n'I know,' he stuttered, 'I know… I'm not what you wanted in a husband. I'm sorry\nfor that. But I'm as much a prisoner in this as you are. I only hope… that perhaps we\ncan make the best of it. Perhaps we might find a way… to care for one another? We\nhave no one else, either of us. Please, tell me what I have to do—'\n'Shhhh.' She touched one finger to his lips, looking into his eyes, one half of her\nface glowing orange from the fire, the other half black with shadow. Her fingers\nworked through his hair and drew him towards her. She kissed him, gently,\nawkwardly, almost, their lips brushing, then pressing clumsily together. He slid one\nhand round behind her neck, under her ear, his thumb stroking at her smooth cheek.\nTheir mouths worked mechanically, accompanied by the soft squeak of breath in his\nnose, the gentle squelch of spit moving. Hardly the most passionate kiss he had ever\nenjoyed, but it was a great deal more than he had ever expected to get from her.\nThere was a pleasant tingling building in his crotch as he pushed his tongue into her\nmouth."

He grunted softly as he slid his hand over her arse, down the side of her\nthigh then up between her legs, the hem of her shift gathering round his wrist. He felt\nher shudder, felt her flinch, and bite her lip in shock, it seemed, or even in disgust.\nHe jerked his hand back, and they broke apart, both looking at the floor. 'I'm sorry,'\nhe muttered, inwardly cursing his eagerness. 'I—'\n'No. It's my fault. I'm not… experienced… with men…' Jezal blinked for a\nmoment, then almost smiled at a surge of relief. Of course. Now everything was\nclear. She was so assured, so sharp, it had never even occurred to him that she\nmight be a virgin. It was simple fear that made her tremble so. Fear of disappointing\nhim. He felt a rush of sympathy.\n'Don't worry,' he murmured it softly, stepping forward and taking her in his arms.\nHe felt her stiffen, no doubt with nervousness, and he gently stroked her hair. 'I can\nwait… we don't have to… not yet.'\n'No.' She said it with a touching determination, looking him fearlessly in the eye.\n'No. We do.'\nShe dragged her shift up and over her head, let it drop to the floor. She came\nclose to him, took hold of his wrist, guided it back to her thigh, then upwards.\n'Ah,' she whispered, urgent and throaty, her lips brushing his cheek, her breath\nhot in his ear. 'Yes… just there… don't stop.' She led him breathless to the bed.\n'If that is all?' Glokta looked around the table, but the old men were silent. All\nwaiting for my word. The king was absent again, so he made them wait an\nunnecessarily long time. Just to stab home to any doubters who is in charge. Why\nnot, after all? The purpose of power is not to be gracious. Then this meeting of the\nClosed Council is over.'\nThey rose, quickly, quietly, and in good order. Torlichorm, Halleck, Kroy and all\nthe rest filed slowly from the room. Glokta himself struggled up, his leg still aching\nwith the memory of the morning's cramps, only to find that the Lord Chamberlain\nhad, once again, remained behind. And he looks far from amused.\nHoff waited until the door shut before he spoke. 'Imagine my surprise,' he\nsnapped, 'to hear of your recent marriage.'\n'A swift and understated ceremony.' Glokta showed the Lord Chamberlain the\nwreckage of his front teeth. 'Young love, you understand, brooks no delays. I\napologise if the lack of an invitation offended you.'\n'An invitation?' growled Hoff, frowning mightily. 'Hardly! This is not what we\ndiscussed!'\n'Discussed?

Or lean before you, twisted as an old tree root.\nA crippled, shambling, wretched mockery of a man, eh, Lord Hoff? Let us be\nhonest with one another. Sometimes I lose control of my own leg. My own eyes. My\nown face.' He snorted. 'If you can call it a face. My bowels too, are rebellious. I\noften wake up daubed in my own shit. I find myself in constant pain, and the\nmemories of everything that I have lost nag at me, endlessly.' He felt his left eye\ntwitching. Let it twitch. 'So you can see how, despite my constant efforts to be a\nman of sunny temper, I find that I despise the world, and everything in it, and myself\nmost of all. A regrettable state of affairs, for which there is no remedy.'\nThe Lord Chamberlain licked his lips uncertainly. 'You have my sympathy, but I\nfail to see the relevance.'\nGlokta came suddenly very close, ignoring a spasm up his leg, pressing Hoff\nback against the table. 'Your sympathy is less than worthless, and the relevance is\nthis. Knowing what I am, what I have endured, what I still endure… can you\nsuppose there is anything in this world I fear? Any act I will shrink from? The most\nunbearable pain of others is at the worst… an irritation to me.' Glokta jerked even\ncloser, letting his lips work back from his ruined teeth, letting his face tremble, and\nhis eye weep. 'Knowing all that… can you possibly think it wise… for a man to\nstand where you stand now… and make threats? Threats against my wife? Against\nmy unborn child?'\n'No threat was intended, of course, I would never—'\n'That simply would not do, Lord Hoff! That simply would not do. At the very\nslightest breath of violence against them… why, I would not wish you even to\nimagine the inhuman horror of my response.'\nCloser yet, so close that his spit made a soft mist across Hoff's trembling jowls.\n'I cannot permit any further discussion of this issue. Ever. I cannot permit even the\nrumour that there might be an issue. Ever. It simply… would… not… do, Lord\nHoff, for an eyeless, tongueless, faceless, fingerless, cockless bag of meat to be\noccupying your chair on the Closed Council.'

'Why, my Lord Chamberlain… who would drink all the wine?'\nIt was a beautiful autumn day in Adua, and the sun shone pleasantly through the\nbranches of the fragrant fruit trees, casting a dappled shade onto the grass beneath.\nA pleasing breeze fluttered through the orchard, stirring the crimson mantle of the\nking as he strode regally around his lawn, and the white coat of his Arch Lector as\nhe hobbled doggedly along at a respectful distance, stooped over his cane. Birds\ntwittered from the trees, and his Majesty's highly polished boots crunched in the\ngravel and made faint, agreeable echoes against the white buildings of the palace.\nFrom the other side of the high walls came the faint sound of distant work. The\nclanking of picks and hammers, the scraping of earth and the clattering of stone. The\nfaint calls of the carpenters and the masons. These were the most pleasant sounds of\nall, to Jezal's ear. The sounds of rebuilding.\n'It will take time, of course,' he was saying.\n'Of course.'\n'Years, perhaps. But much of the rubble is already cleared. The repair of some of\nthe more lightly damaged buildings has already begun. The Agriont will be more\nglorious than ever before you know it. I have made it my highest priority.'\nGlokta bowed his head even lower. 'And therefore mine, and that of your Closed\nCouncil. Might I enquire…' he murmured, 'after the health of your wife, the queen?'\nJezal worked his mouth. He hardly liked discussing his personal business with\nthis man, of all people, but it could not be denied that whatever the cripple had said,\nthere had been a most dramatic improvement.\n'A material change.' Jezal shook his head. 'I find now that she is a woman of\nalmost… insatiable appetites.'\n'I am delighted that my entreaties have had an effect.'\n'Oh, they have, they have, only there is still a certain…' Jezal waved his hand in\nthe air, searching out the right word. 'Sadness in her. Sometimes… I hear her crying,\nin the night. She stands at the open window, and she weeps, for hours at a time.'\n'Crying, your Majesty? Perhaps she is merely homesick. I always suspected she\nwas a much gentler spirit than she appears to be.'\n'She is! She is. A gentle spirit.' Jezal thought about it for a moment. 'Do you\nknow, I think you may be right. Homesick.' A plan began to take shape in his mind.\n'Perhaps we should have the gardens of the palace redesigned, to give a flavour of\nTalins? We could have the stream altered, in the likeness of canals, and so forth!'\nGlokta leered his toothless grin. 'A sublime idea. I shall speak to the Royal\nGardener. Perhaps another brief word with her Majesty as well, to see if I can\nstaunch her tears.'\n'I would appreciate whatever you can do.

You know, about a tax on the\nbanks? Perhaps to pay for a new hospital near the docks. For those who cannot\nafford a surgeon. The common folk have been good to us. They have helped us to\npower, and suffered in our name. A government should offer something to all its\npeople, should it not?

But they both knew the answer to that question\nwell enough.\n'You are king, of course.'\n'Of course.'\n'But our mutual friend… we would not wish to disappoint him.' Glokta came a\nlimping step closer, his left eye giving a repulsive flutter. 'Neither one of us, I am\nsure, would want to encourage a visit to Adua… on his part.'\nJezal's knees felt suddenly very weak. The faint memory of that awful, unbearable\npain nagged at his stomach. 'No,' he croaked, 'no, of course not.'\nThe cripple's voice was only just above a whisper. 'Perhaps, in time, funds could\nbe found for some small project. Our friend cannot see everything, after all, and\nwhat he does not see will do no harm. I am sure between the two of us, quietly… we\ncould do some little good. But not yet.'\n'No. You are right, Glokta. You have a fine sense for these things. Do nothing\nthat would cause the least offence. Please inform our friend that his opinions will\nalways be valued above all others. Please tell our good friend that he can rely on me.\nWill you tell him that, please?'\n'I will, your Majesty. He will be delighted to hear it.'\n'Good,' murmured Jezal. 'Good.' A chilly breeze had blown up, and he turned\nback towards the palace, pulling his cloak around him.

One of the chairs\nat the bolted-down table was empty. Carlot dan Eider sat in the other. History moves\nin circles, so they say. How things have changed. And yet, how they have stayed\nthe same. Her face was pale with worry, there were dark rings of sleeplessness\naround her eyes, but she still seemed beautiful. More than ever, in a way. The\nbeauty of the candle-flame that has almost burned out.

'I am\nstill wondering whether, in the next few days, I will receive that letter you spoke of.\nYou know the one. The one you meant for Sult to read.

Never come back, I said. Not ever.' He waved with his hand and one of the\nmonstrous Practicals stepped forward and lifted the lid of his case.\n'No… no.' Her eyes darted over his instruments, and back. 'You won. You won,\nof course. I should have been grateful, the first time. Please.' She leaned forward,\nlooking him in the eyes. Her voice dropped, grew husky, 'Please. Surely there must\nbe… something that I can do… to make up for my foolishness…'\nA peculiar mixture of feigned desire and genuine disgust. Fake longing and\ngenuine loathing. And rendered still more distasteful by the edge of mounting\nterror. It makes me wonder why I was merciful in the first place.\nGlokta snorted. 'Must this be embarrassing as well as painful?'\nThe effort at seduction leaked quickly away. But I note that the fear is going\nnowhere. It was joined now by a rising note of desperation. 'I know that I made a\nmistake… I was trying to help… please, I meant you no real harm… I caused you\nno harm, you know it!' He reached out slowly towards the case, watched her\nhorrified eyes follow his white-gloved hand, her voice rising to a squeal of panic.\n'Only tell me what I can do! Please! I can help you!

He tapped one\nfinger against the wood. The finger on which the Arch Lector's ring glittered in the\nlamplight. 'Perhaps there is a way.'\n'Anything,' she gurgled, teary eyes gleaming. 'Anything, only name it!'\n'You have contacts in Talins?'\nShe swallowed. 'In Talins? Of… of course.'\n'Good. I, and some colleagues of mine on the Closed Council, are concerned\nabout the role that Grand Duke Orso means to play in Union politics. Our\nfeeling—our very strong feeling—is that he should stick to bullying Styrians, and\nkeep his nose out of our business.' He gave a significant pause.\n'How do I—'\n'You will go to Talins. You will be my eyes in the city. A traitor, fleeing for her\nlife, friendless and alone, seeking only a place for a new beginning. A beautiful yet\nwretched traitor, in desperate need of a strong arm to protect her. You get the idea.'\n'I suppose… I suppose that I could do that.'\nGlokta snorted. 'You had better.'\n'I will need money—'\n'Your assets have been seized by the Inquisition.'\n'Everything?'\n'You may have noticed that there is a great deal of rebuilding to do. The king\nneeds every mark he can lay his hands on, and confessed traitors can hardly expect\nto keep their chattels in such times as these. I have arranged passage for you. When\nyou arrive, make contact with the banking house of Valint and Balk. They will\narrange a loan to get you started.'\n'Valint and Balk?' Eider looked even more scared than before, if that was\npossible. 'I would rather be in debt to anyone but them.'\n'I know the feeling. But it's that or nothing.'\n'How will I—'\n'A woman of your resourcefulness? I am sure that you will find a way.' He\nwinced as he pushed himself up from his chair. 'I want to be snowed in by your\nletters. What happens in the city. What Orso is about. Who he makes war with, who\nhe makes peace with. Who are his allies and his enemies. You leave on the next tide.'\nHe turned back, briefly, at the door. 'I'll be watching.'\nShe nodded dumbly, wiping away the tears of relief with the back of one\ntrembling hand. First it is done to us, then we do it to others, then we order it done.\nSuch is the way of things.\n'Are you always drunk by this time in the morning?'\n'Your Eminence, you wound me.' Nicomo Cosca grinned. 'Usually I have been\ndrunk for hours by now.'\nHuh. We each find our ways of getting through the day. 'I should thank you for\nall your help.'\nThe Styrian gave a flamboyant wave of one hand. A hand, Glokta noticed,\nflashing with a fistful of heavy rings. 'To hell with your thanks, I have your money.'\n'And I think every penny well spent. I hope that you will remain in the city, and"

The mercenary scratched thoughtfully at the rash\non his neck leaving red fingernail marks through the flaky skin. 'At least until the gold\nruns out.'\n'How quickly can you possibly spend what I have paid you?'\n'Oh, you would be amazed. I have wasted ten fortunes in my time and more\nbesides. I look forward to wasting another.' Cosca slapped his hands down on his\nthighs, pushed himself up, strolled, somewhat unsteadily, to the door, and turned\nwith a flourish. 'Make sure you call on me when you next have a desperate last stand\norganised.'\n'My first letter will bear your name.'\n'Then I bid you… farewell!' Cosca swept off his enormous hat and bowed low.\nThen, with a knowing grin, he stepped through the doorway, and was gone.\nGlokta had moved the Arch Lector's office to a large hall on the ground floor of\nthe House of Questions. Closer to the real business of the Inquisition—the\nprisoners. Closer to the questions, and the answers. Closer to the truth. And, of\ncourse, the real clincher… no stairs.\nThere were well-tended gardens outside the large windows. The faint sound of a\nfountain splashing beyond the glass. But inside the room there was none of the ugly\nparaphernalia of power. The walls were plastered and painted simple white. The\nfurniture was hard and functional. The whetstone of discomfort has kept me sharp\nthis long. No reason to let the edge grow dull, simply because I have run out of\nenemies. New enemies will present themselves, before too long.\nThere were some heavy bookcases of dark wood. Several leather-covered desks,\nalready stacked high with documents requiring his attention. Aside from the great\nround table with its map of the Union and its pair of bloody nail-marks, there was\nonly one item of Sult's furniture that Glokta had brought downstairs with him. The\ndark painting of bald old Zoller glowered down from above the simple fireplace.\nBearing an uncanny resemblance to a certain Magus I once knew. It is fitting after\nall, that we maintain the proper perspective. Every man answers to somebody.\nThere was a knocking at the door, and the head of Glokta's secretary appeared at\nthe gap. 'The Lord Marshals have arrived, Arch Lector.'\n'Show them in.'\nSometimes, when old friends meet, things are instantly as they were, all those\nyears before. The friendship resumes, untouched, as though there had been no\ninterruption. Sometimes, but not now. Collem West was scarcely recognisable. His\nhair had fallen out in ugly patches. His face was shrunken, had a yellow tinge about\nit. His uniform hung slack from his bony shoulders, stained around the collar. He\nshuffled into the room, bent over in an old man's stoop, leaning heavily on a stick.\nHe looked like nothing so much as a walking corpse.\nGlokta had expected something of the kind, of course, from what Ardee had told"

But the sick shock of disappointment and horror he felt at the sight still caught\nhim by surprise. Like returning to the happy haunt of one's youth, and finding it\nall in ruins. Deaths. They happen every day. How many lives have I wrecked with\nmy own hands? What makes this one so hard to take? And yet it was. He found\nhimself lurching up from his chair, starting painfully forwards as if to lend some help.\n'Your Eminence.' West's voice was fragile and jagged as broken glass. He made a\nweak effort at a smile. 'Or I suppose… I should call you brother.'\n'West… Collem… it is good to see you.' Good, and awful both at once.\nA cluster of officers followed West into the room. The wonderfully competent\nLieutenant Jalenhorm I remember, of course, but a Major now. And Brint too,\nmade a Captain by his friends swift advancement. Marshal Kroy we know and\nlove from the Closed Council. Congratulations, all, on your advancement. Another\nman brought up the rear of the party. A lean man with a face horribly burned. But\nwe, of all people, should hardly hold a repulsive disfigurement against him. Each\none of them frowned nervously towards West, as though ready to pounce forward if\nhe should slump to the floor. Instead he shuffled to the round table and sagged\ntrembling into the nearest chair.\n'I should have come to you,' said Glokta. I should have come to you far sooner.\nWest made another effort at a smile, even more bilious than the last. Several of\nhis teeth were missing. 'Nonsense. I know how busy you are, now. And I am feeling\nmuch better today.'\n'Good, good. That is… good. Is there anything that I can get you?' What could\npossibly help? 'Anything at all.'\nWest shook his head. 'I do not think so. These gentlemen you know, of course.\nApart from Sergeant Pike.' The burned man nodded to him.\n'A pleasure.' To meet someone even more maimed than myself, always.\n'I hear… happy news, from my sister.'\nGlokta winced, almost unable to meet his old friend's eye. 'I should have sought\nyour permission, of course. I surely would have, had there been time.'\n'I understand.' West's bright eyes were fixed on his. 'She has explained it all. It is\nsome kind of comfort to know that she'll be well taken care of.'\n'On that you can depend. I will see to it. She will never be hurt again.'\nWest's gaunt face twisted. 'Good. Good.' He rubbed gently at the side of his\nface. His fingernails were black, edged with dried blood, as though they were peeling\nfrom the flesh beneath. 'There's always a price to be paid, eh, Sand? For the things\nwe do?'\nGlokta felt his eye twitching. 'It would seem so.'\n'I have lost some of my teeth.'\n'I see that, and can sympathise. Soup, I find…' I find utterly disgusting.\n'I am… scarcely able to walk.'"

Your cane will be your best friend.' As it will soon be\nmine, I think.\n'I am a pitiable shell of what I was.'\n'I truly feel your pain.' Truly. Almost more keenly than my own.\nWest slowly shook his withered head. 'How can you stand it?'\n'One step at a time, my old friend. Steer clear of stairs where possible, and\nmirrors, always.'\n'Wise advice.' West coughed. An echoing cough, from right down beneath his\nribs. He swallowed noisily. 'I think my time is running out.'\n'Surely not!' Glokta's hand reached out for a moment, as if to rest on West's\nshrunken shoulder, as if to offer comfort. He jerked it back, awkwardly. It is not\nsuited to the task.\nWest licked at his empty gums. 'This is how most of us go, isn't it? No final\ncharge. No moment of glory. We just… fall slowly apart.'\nGlokta would have liked to say something optimistic. But that rubbish comes\nfrom other mouths than mine. Younger, prettier mouths, with all their teeth,\nperhaps. 'Those who die on the battlefield are in some ways the lucky few. Forever\nyoung. Forever glorious.'\nWest nodded, slowly. 'Here's to the lucky few, then…' His eyes rolled back, he\nswayed, then slumped sideways. Jalenhorm was the first forward, catching him\nbefore he hit the ground. He flopped in the big man's arms, a long string of thin\nvomit splattering against the floor.\n'Back to the palace!' snapped Kroy. 'At once!'\nBrint hurried to swing the doors open while Jalenhorm and Kroy steered West\nout of the room, draped between them with his arms over their shoulders. His limp\nshoes scraped against the floor, his piebald head lolling. Glokta watched them go,\nstanding helpless, his toothless mouth half open, as if to speak. As if to wish his\nfriend good luck, or good health, or a merry afternoon. None of them seem quite to\nfit the circumstance, however.\nThe doors clattered shut and Glokta was left staring at them. His eyelid flickered,\nhe felt wet on his cheek. Not tears of compassion, of course. Not tears of grief. I feel\nnothing, fear nothing, care for nothing. They cut away the parts of me that could\nweep in the Emperor's prisons. This can only be salt water, and nothing more.\nMerely a broken reflex in a mutilated face. Farewell, brother. Farewell, my only\nfriend. And farewell to the ghost of beautiful Sand dan Glokta, too. Nothing of him\nremains. All for the best, of course. A man in my position can afford no\nindulgences.\nHe took a sharp breath, and wiped his face with the back of his hand.

Papers of confession, tasks\noutstanding, all the tedious business of government—\nHe looked up. A figure had detached itself from the shadows behind one of the\nhigh book-cases and now stepped out into the room, arms folded. The man with the\nburned face who had come in with the officers. In the excitement of their exit, it\nseemed that he had remained behind.\n'Sergeant Pike, was it?' murmured Glokta, frowning.\n'That's the name I've taken.'\n'Taken?'\nThe scarred face twisted into a mockery of a smile. One even more hideous than\nmy own, if that's possible. 'Not surprising, that you shouldn't recognise me. My first\nweek, there was an accident in a forge. Accidents often happen, in Angland.'\nAngland? That voice… something about that voice… 'Still nothing? Perhaps if I\ncome closer?'\nHe sprang across the room without warning. Glokta was still struggling up from\nhis seat as the man dived across the desk. They tumbled to the floor together in a\ncloud of flying paper, Glokta underneath, the back of his skull cracking against the\nstone, his breath all driven out in a long, agonised wheeze.\nHe felt the brush of steel against his neck. Pike's face was no more than a few\ninches from his, the mottled mass of burns picked out in particularly revolting detail.\n'How about now?' he hissed. 'Anything seem familiar?'\nGlokta felt his left eye flickering as recognition washed over him like a wave of\nfreezing water. Changed, of course. Changed utterly and completely. And yet I\nknow him.\n'Rews,' he breathed.\n'None other.' Rews bit off the words with grim satisfaction.\n'You survived.' Glokta whispered it, first with amazement, then with mounting\namusement. 'You survived! You're a far harder man than I gave you credit for! Far,\nfar harder.' He started to chuckle, tears running down the side of his cheek again.\n'Something funny?'\n'Everything! You have to appreciate the irony. I have overcome so many\npowerful enemies, and it's Salem Rews with the knife at my neck! It's always the\nblade you don't see coming that cuts you deepest, eh?'\n'You'll get no deeper cuts than this one.'\n'Then cut away, my man, I am ready.' Glokta tipped his head back, stretched his\nneck out, pressing it up against the cold metal. 'I've been ready for a long time.'\nRews' fist worked around the grip of his knife. His burned face trembled, eyes\nnarrowing to bright slits in their pink sockets. Now.\nHis mottled lips slid back from his teeth. The sinews in his neck stood out as he\nmade ready to wield the blade. Do it.\nGlokta's breath hissed quickly in and out, his throat tingling with anticipation.\nNow, at last. . . now…\nBut Rews' arm did not move.\n'And yet you hesitate,' whispered Glokta through his empty gums.

What will you truly have gained, with all your\nendurance? With all your cunning and your effort? Will you be hunted? Will you be\nsent back? I can offer you so much more.'\nRews' melted frown grew even harder. 'What could you give me? After this?'\n'Oh, this is nothing. I suffer twice the pain and ten times the humiliation getting up\nin the morning. A man like you could be very useful to me. A man… as hard as you\nhave proved yourself to be. A man who has lost everything, including all his\nscruples, all his mercy, all his fear. We both have lost everything. We both have\nsurvived. I understand you, Rews, as no one else ever can.'\n'Pike is my name, now.'\n'Of course it is. Let me up, Pike.'\nSlowly the knife slid away from his throat. The man who had been Salem Rews\nstood over him, frowning down. Who could ever anticipate the turns that fate can\ntake? 'Up, then.'\n'Easier said than done.' Glokta dragged in a few sharp breaths, then growling with\na great and painful effort he rolled over onto all fours. A heroic achievement indeed.\nHe slowly tested his limbs, wincing as his twisted joints clicked. Nothing broken. No\nmore broken than usual, anyway. He reached out and took the handle of his fallen\ncane between two fingers, dragged it towards him through the scattered papers. He\nfelt the point of the blade pressing into his back.\n'Don't take me for a fool, Glokta. If you try anything—'\nHe clutched at the edge of the desk and dragged himself up. 'You'll cut my liver\nout and all the rest. Don't worry. I am far too crippled to try anything worse than shit\nmyself. I have something to show you, though. Something that I feel sure you will\nappreciate. If I'm wrong, well… you can slit my throat a little later.'\nGlokta lurched out of the heavy door of his office, Pike sticking as close to his\nshoulder as a shadow, the knife kept carefully out of sight.\n'Stay,' he snapped at the two Practicals in the ante-room, hobbling on past the\nfrowning secretary at the huge desk. Out into the wide hallway running through the\nheart of the House of Questions and Glokta limped faster, cane clicking against the\ntiles. It hurt him to do it, but he held his head back, gave a cold wrinkle to his lip.\nOut of the corners of his eyes he saw the Clerks, the Practicals, the Inquisitors,\nbowing, sliding backwards, clearing away.

You lost weight.'\n'Starving can do that.'\n'Indeed, indeed. I lost a great deal of weight in Gurkhul. And not just from the\npieces they cut out of me. This way.'\nThey turned through a heavy door flanked by frowning Practicals, past an open\ngate of iron bars. Into a long and windowless corridor, sloping steadily downwards,\nlit by too few lanterns and filled with slow shadows. The walls were rendered and\nwhitewashed, though none too recently. There was a seedy feel to the place, and a\nsmell of damp. Just as there always is. The clicking of Glokta's cane, the hissing of\nhis breath, the rustling of his white coat, all fell dead on the chill, wet air.\n'Killing me will bring you scant satisfaction, you know.'\n'We shall see.'\n'I doubt it. I was hardly the one responsible for your little trip northwards. I did\nthe work perhaps, but others gave the orders.'\n'They were not my friends.'\nGlokta snorted. 'Please. Friends are people one pretends to like in order to make\nlife bearable. Men like us have no need of such indulgences. It is our enemies by\nwhich we are measured.' And here are mine. Sixteen steps confronted him. That\nold, familiar flight. Cut from smooth stone, a little worn towards the centre.\n'Steps. Bastard things. If I could torture one man, do you know who it would\nbe?' Pike's face was a single, expressionless scar. 'Well, never mind.' Glokta\nstruggled to the bottom without incident, limped on a few more painful strides to a\nheavy wooden door, bound with iron.\n'We are here.' Glokta slid a bunch of keys from the pocket of his white coat,\nflicked through them until he found the right one, unlocked the door, and went in.\nArch Lector Sult was not the man he used to be. But then none of us are, quite.\nHis magnificent shock of white hair was plastered greasily to his gaunt skull, dry\nblood matted in a yellow-brown mass on one side. His piercing blue eyes had lost\ntheir commanding sparkle, sunken as they were in deep sockets and rimmed with\nangry pink. He had been relieved of his clothes, and his sinewy old man's body,\nsomewhat hairy around the shoulders, was smeared with the grime of the cells. He\nlooked, in fact, like nothing so much as a mad old beggar. Can this truly once have\nbeen one of the most powerful men in the wide Circle of the World? You would\nnever guess. A salutary lesson to us all. The higher you climb, the further there is\nto fall.\n'Glokta!' he snarled, thrashing helplessly, chained to his chair. 'You treacherous,\ntwisted bastard!'"

The Closed Council is all changed, and you are forgotten. I run things now.\nMore completely than you could ever have dreamed of doing.'\n'On the leash of that devil Bayaz!'\n'Correct. Maybe in time I'll work some looseness into his muzzle, just as I did\ninto yours. Enough to get things my own way, who knows?'\n'Never! You'll never be free of him!'\n'We'll see.' Glokta shrugged. 'But there are worse fates than being the first among\nslaves. Far worse. I have seen them.' I have lived them.\n'You fool! We could have been free!'\n'No. We couldn't.

Not for questions, not for truth, not for\nconfessions. I have my answers already.' Then why do I do this? Why? Glokta\nleaned slowly forwards across the table.

He stood there for a\nlong moment, motionless.\nThen he stepped forward, and lifted the lid of the case.\n'Does the devil know he is a devil?'\nElizabeth Madox Roberts\nThe Beginning\n« ^\nThe sides of the valley were coated in white snow. The black road ran through it like\nan old scar, down to the bridge, over the river, up to the gates of Carleon. Black\nsprouts of sedge, tufts of black grass, black stones poked up through the clean\nwhite blanket. The black branches of the trees were each picked out on top with their\nown line of white. The city was a huddle of white roofs and black walls, crowded in\naround the hill, pressed into the fork in the black river under a stony grey sky.\nLogen wondered if this was how Ferro Maljinn saw the world. Black and white,\nand nothing else. No colours. He wondered where she was now, what she was\ndoing. If she thought about him.\nMost likely not.\n'Back again.'\n'Aye,' said Shivers. 'Back.' He hadn't had much to say the whole long ride from\nUffrith. They might have saved each other's lives, but conversation was another\nmatter. Logen reckoned he still wasn't Shivers' favourite man. Doubted that he ever\nwould be.\nThey rode down in silence, a long file of hard riders beside the black stream, no\nmore than an icy trickle. Horses and men snorted out smoke, harness jingled sharp\non the cold air. They rode over the bridge, hooves thumping on the hollow wood,\non to the gate where Logen had spoken to Bethod. The gate he'd thrown him down\nfrom. The grass had grown back, no doubt, in the circle where he'd killed the\nFeared, then the snow had fallen down and covered it. So it was with all the acts of\nmen, in the end. Covered over and forgotten.\nThere was no one out to cheer for him, but that was no surprise. The\nBloody-Nine arriving was never any cause for celebration, especially not in Carleon.\nHadn't turned out too well for anyone the first time he visited. Nor any of the times\nafter. Folk were no doubt barred into their houses, scared that they'd be the first to\nget burned alive.\nHe swung down from his horse, left Red Hat and the rest of the boys to see to\nthemselves. He strode up through the cobbled street, up the steep slope towards the\ngateway of the inner wall, Shivers at his shoulder. A couple of Carls watched him\ncome. A couple of Dow's boys, rough-looking bastards. One of them gave him a\ngrin with half the teeth missing. 'The king!' he shouted, waving his sword in the air.\n'The Bloody-Nine!' shouted the other, rattling his shield.

It wasn't much warmer inside than out in the snow. The high windows were\nopen at the far end, the noise of the cold, cold river roaring from far below.\nSkarling's Chair stood on its raised-up platform, at the top of the steps, casting a\nlong shadow across the rough floorboards towards him.\nSomeone was sitting in it, Logen realised, as his eyes got used to the dark. Black\nDow. His axe and his sword leaned up against the side of the chair, the glint of\nsharpened metal in the darkness. Just like him, that. Always kept his weapons close\nto hand.\nLogen grinned at him. 'Getting comfortable, Dow?'\n'Bit hard on the arse, being honest, but it's better'n dirt for sitting in.'\n'Did you find Calder and Scale?'\n'Aye. I found 'em.'\n'Dead, then, are they?'\n'Not yet. Thought I'd try something different. We been talking.'\n'Talking is it? To those two bastards?'\n'I can think o' worse. Where's the Dogman at?'\n'Still back there, trading words with the Union, sorting out an understanding.'\n'Grim?'\nLogen shook his head. 'Back to the mud.'\n'Huh. Well, there it is. Makes this easier, anyway.' Dow's eyes flickered sideways.\n'Makes what easier?' Logen looked round. Shivers was standing right at his\nshoulder, scowling as if he had someone's murder in mind. No need to ask whose.\nSteel gleamed beside him in the shadows. A blade, out and ready. He could've\nstabbed Logen in the back with time to spare. But he hadn't done, and he didn't\nnow. It seemed as if they all stayed still for quite a while, frozen as the cold valley\nout beyond the windows.\n'Shit on this.' Shivers tossed the knife away clattering across the floor. 'I'm\nbetter'n you, Bloody-Nine. I'm better than the pair o' you. You can get your own\nwork done, Black Dow. I'm done with it.' He turned round and strode out, shoving\nhis way past the two Carls from the gate, just now coming the other way. One of\nthem hefted his shield as he frowned at Logen. The other one pulled the doors shut,\nswung the bar down with a final-sounding clunk.\nLogen slid the Maker's sword out of its sheath, turned his head and spat on the\nboards. 'Like that, is it?'\n'Course it is,' said Dow, still sat in Skarling's chair. 'If you'd ever looked a stride\nfurther than the end o' your nose you'd know it.'\n'What about the old ways, eh? What about your word?'\n'The old ways are gone. You killed 'em. You and Bethod. Men's words ain't\nworth much these days. Well then?' he called over his shoulder. 'Now's your chance,\nain't it?'"

'Now's your chance,\nain't it?'\nLogen felt the moment. A lucky choice, maybe, but he'd always had plenty of\nluck, good and bad. He dived sideways, heard the rattle of the flatbow at the same\nmoment, rolled across the floor and came up in a crouch as the bolt clattered against\nthe wall behind him. He saw a figure in the dark now, kneeling up at the far end of\nthe hall. Calder. Logen heard his curse, fishing for another bolt.\n'Bloody-Nine, you broken dog!' Scale came pounding out of the shadows, boots\nbattering the floorboards, an axe in his great fists with a blade big as a cart-wheel.\n'Here's your death!'\nLogen stayed where he was, crouching loose and ready, and he felt himself smile.\nThe odds were against him, maybe, but that was nothing new. It was almost a relief,\nnot to have to think. Fine words and politics, none of that meant anything to him.\nBut this? This he understood.\nThe blade crashed into the boards, sent splinters flying. Logen had already rolled\nout of the way. Now he backed off, watching, moving, letting Scale cleave the air\naround him. The air healed quick, after all. The next blow flashed sideways and\nLogen dodged back, let it chop a great lump of plaster from the wall. He stepped in\ncloser as Scale snarled again, his furious little eyes bulging, ready to swing his axe\nround in a blow to split the world.\nThe pommel of the Maker's sword crunched into his mouth before he got the\nchance, jerked his head up, spots of black blood and a chunk of white tooth flying.\nHe staggered back and Logen followed him. Scale's eyes rolled down, axe going up\nhigh, opening his bloody mouth to make another bellow. Logen's boot rammed hard\ninto the side of his leg. His knee bent back the wrong way with a sharp pop and he\ndropped to the boards, axe flying from his hands, his roar turning to a shriek of pain.\n'My knee! Ah! Fuck! My knee!' He thrashed on the floor, blood running down\nhis chin, trying to kick his way back with only one good leg.\nLogen laughed at him. 'You bloated pig. I warned you, didn't I?'\n'By the fucking dead!' barked Dow. He sprang up out of Skarling's chair, axe and\nsword in his hands. 'If you want a thing done fucking right, you'd best get ready to\nset your own hand to it!'\nLogen would've liked to stab Scale right through his fat head, but there were too\nmany other men needed watching. The two Carls were still standing by the door.\nCalder was loading up his next bolt. Logen sidled into space, trying to keep his eye\non all of them at once, and Dow most of all. 'Aye, you faithless bastard!' he shouted.\n'Let's have you!'\n'Faithless, me?' Dow snorted as he came on slow down the steps, one at a time."

        "text": "'Let's have you!'\n'Faithless, me?' Dow snorted as he came on slow down the steps, one at a time.\n'I'm a dark bastard, aye, I know what I am. But I'm nothing to you. I know my\nfriends from my enemies. I never killed my own. Bethod was right about one thing,\nBloody-Nine. You're made of death. If I can put an end to you, d'you know what?\nThat'll be the best thing I've done in my life.'\n'That all?'\nDow showed his teeth. 'That, and I'm just plain sick o' taking your fucking\nsay-so.'\nHe came on fast as a snake, axe swinging over, sword flashing across waist high.\nLogen dodged the axe, met the blade with his own, metal clanging on metal. Dow\ncaught him in his sore ribs with his knee and sent him gasping back towards the wall,\nthen came at him again, blades leaving bright traces in the darkness. Logen sprang\nout of the way, rolled and came up, strutting out into the middle of the hall again,\nsword hanging loose from his hand.\n'That it?' he asked, smiling through the pain in his side.\n'Just getting the blood flowing.'\nDow leaped forward, made to go right and came left instead, sword and axe\nsweeping down together. Logen saw them coming, weaved away from the axe,\nturned the sword off his own and stepped in, growling. Dow jerked back as the\nMaker's blade hissed through the air right in front of his face, stumbled away a step\nor two. His eye twitched, some red leaking down his cheek from a nick just under it.\nLogen grinned, spun the grip of his sword round in his hand. 'Blood's flowing now,\neh?'\n'Aye.' Dow gave a grin of his own. 'Just like old times.'\n'I should've killed you then.'\n'Damn right you should've.' Dow circled round him, always moving, weapons\ngleaming in the cold light from the tall windows. 'But you love to play the good man,\ndon't you? Do you know what's worse than a villain? A villain who thinks he's a\nhero. A man like that, there's nothing he won't do, and he'll always find himself an\nexcuse. We've had one ruthless bastard make himself King o' the North, and I'll be\ndamned before I see a worse.' He feinted forward and Logen jerked back.\nHe heard the click of Calder's flatbow again and saw the bolt flash right between\nthem. Dow scowled over at him. 'You trying to kill me? You loose another bolt and\nyou're spitted, you hear?'\n'Stop pissing around and kill him, then!' snapped Calder, cranking away at his\nflatbow.\n'Kill him!' bellowed Scale, from somewhere in the shadows.\n'I'm working at it, pig.' Dow jerked his head at the two Carls by the door. 'You\ntwo going to pitch in or what?' They looked at each other, none too keen. Then they\ncame forward into the hall, their round shields up, their eyes on Logen, herding him\ntowards one corner."

        "text": "two going to pitch in or what?' They looked at each other, none too keen. Then they\ncame forward into the hall, their round shields up, their eyes on Logen, herding him\ntowards one corner.\nLogen bared his teeth as he backed off. 'That's how you'll get it done, is it?'\n'I'd rather kill you fair. But kill you crooked?' Dow shrugged his shoulders. 'Just\nas good. I ain't in the business o' giving chances. Go on then! At him!'\nThe two of them closed in, cautious, Dow moving off to the side. Logen\nscrambled back, trying to look scared and waiting for some kind of chance. It wasn't\nlong coming. One of the Carls stepped a touch too close, let his shield drop low. He\nchose a bad moment to raise his axe and a bad way to do it. There was a click as the\nMaker's sword took his forearm off, left it hanging from his elbow by a scrap of\nchain-mail. He stumbled forward, dragging in a great wheezing breath, making ready\nto scream, blood spurting out of the stump of his arm and splattering on the boards.\nLogen chopped a great gash out of his helmet and he dropped down on his knees.\n'Gwarghh…' he muttered, blood pouring down the side of his face. His eyes\nrolled up to the ceiling and he flopped on his side. The other Carl jumped over his\nbody, roaring at the top of his lungs. Logen caught his sword, their blades scraping\ntogether, then he barged into the man's shield with his shoulder, sent him sprawling\non his arse. He gave a wail, the Carl, one boot sticking up. Logen swung the Maker's\nsword down and split that foot in half up to his ankle.\nQuick footsteps came up under the Carl's shriek. Logen spun, saw Black Dow\ncharging at him, face crushed up into a killing grin.\n'Die!' he hissed. Logen lurched away, the blade just missing him on one side, the\naxe on the other. He tried to swing the Maker's sword but Dow was too quick and\ntoo clever, shoved Logen back with his boot and sent him staggering.\n'Die, Bloody-Nine!' Logen dodged, parried, stumbled as Dow came on again, no\npauses and no mercy. Steel glinted in the darkness, blades lashing, killing blows,\nevery one.\n'Die, you evil fucker!' Dow's sword chopped down and Logen only just brought\nhis own round in time to block it. The axe came out of nowhere, up from\nunderneath, clattered into the crosspiece and tore Logen's blade spinning from his\nnumb hand. He wobbled back a couple of strides and stood, heaving in air, sweat\ntickling at his neck.\nIt was quite a scrape he was in. He'd been in some bad ones alright, and lived to\nsing the songs, but it was hard to see how this could get much worse. Logen\nnodded towards the Maker's sword, lying on the boards just next to Dow's boot.\n'Don't suppose you fancy giving a man a fair chance, and letting me have that blade,\neh?'\nDow grinned wider than ever. 'What's my name? White Dow?'"

        "text": "'Don't suppose you fancy giving a man a fair chance, and letting me have that blade,\neh?'\nDow grinned wider than ever. 'What's my name? White Dow?'\nLogen had a knife to hand, of course. He always did, and more than one. His\neyes flickered from the notched blade of Dow's sword to the glinting edge of his axe\nand back. No amount of knives were going to be a match for those, not in Black\nDow's hands. Then there was Calder's flatbow still rattling away as he tried to load\nthe bastard thing again. He wouldn't miss forever. The Carl with the split foot was\ndragging himself squealing towards the door, on his way to let some more men in\nand finish the job. If Logen stood and fought he was a dead man, Bloody-Nine or\nnot. So it came to a choice between dying and a chance at living, and that's no\nchoice at all.\nOnce you know what has to be done, it's better to do it, than to live with the fear\nof it. That's what Logen's father would have said. So he turned towards the tall\nwindows. The tall, open windows with the bright white sunlight and the cold wind\npouring through, and he ran at them.\nHe heard men shouting behind, but he paid them no mind. He kept running,\nbreath hissing, long strips of light wobbling closer. He was up the steps in a couple\nof bounds, flashed past Skarling's Chair, faster and faster. His right foot clomped\ndown on the hollow floorboards. His left foot slapped down on the stone window\nsill. He sprang out into empty space with all the strength he had left, and for a\nmoment he was free.\nThen he began to fall. Fast. The rough walls, then the steep cliff face flashed\npast—grey rock, green moss, patches of white snow, all tumbling around him.\nLogen turned over slowly in the air, limbs flailing pointlessly, too scared to\nscream. The rushing wind whipped at his eyes, tugged at his clothes, plucked the\nbreath out of his mouth. He'd chosen this? Didn't seem like such a clever choice,\nright then, as he plunged down towards the river. But then say one thing for Logen\nNinefingers, say that—\nThe water came up to meet him. It hit him in the side like a charging bull, punched\nthe air out of his lungs, knocked the sense out of his head, sucked him in and down\ninto the cold darkness…\nAcknowledgments\nFour people without whom:\nBren Abercrombie, whose eyes are sore from reading it\nNick Abercrombie, whose ears are sore from hearing about it\nRob Abercrombie, whose fingers are sore from turning the pages\nLou Abercrombie, whose arms are sore from holding me up\nThen, at the House of Questions, all those who assisted in this testing interrogation,\nbut particularly:\nSuperior Spanton, Practical Weir, and, of course, Inquisitor Redfearn.\nYou can put away the instruments.
