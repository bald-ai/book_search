He threw himself to one side, slipped and fell on his\nface, rolled away thrashing through the brush, expecting the spear through\nhis back at any moment. He scrambled up, breathing hard. He saw the\nbright point poking at him again, dodged out of the way, slithered behind a\nbig tree trunk. He peered out and the Flathead hissed and stabbed at him.\nHe showed himself on the other side, just for a moment, then ducked away,\njumped round the tree and swung the axe down, roaring loud as he could.\nThere was a crack as the blade buried itself deep in the Shanka's skull.\nLucky that, but then Logen reckoned he was due a little luck.\nThe Flathead stood there, blinking at him. Then it started to sway from\nside to side, blood dribbling down its face. Then it dropped like a stone,\ndragging the axe from Logen's fingers, thrashing around on the ground, at\nhis feet. He tried to grab hold of his axe-handle but the Shanka still\nsomehow had a grip on its spear and the point was flailing around in the air.\n'Gah!' squawked Logen as the spear cut a nick in his arm. He felt a\nshadow fall across his face. Another Flathead. A damn big one. Already in\nthe air, arms outstretched. No time to get the axe. No time to get out of the\nway. Logen's mouth opened, but there was no time to say anything. What do\nyou say at a time like that?\nThey crashed to the wet ground together, rolled together through the dirt\nand the thorns and the broken branches, tearing and punching and growling\nat each other. A tree root hit Logen in the head, hard, and made his ears\nring. He had a knife somewhere, but he couldn't remember where. They\nrolled on, and on, downhill, the world flipping and flipping around, Logen\ntrying to shake the fuzz out of his head and throttle the big Flathead at the\nsame time. There was no stopping.\nIt had seemed a clever notion to pitch camp near the gorge. No chance\nof anyone sneaking up behind. Now, as Logen slid over the edge of the cliff\non his belly, the idea lost much of its appeal. His hands scrabbled at the wet\nearth. Only dirt and brown pine needles. His fingers clutched, clutched at\nnothing. He was beginning to fall. He let go a little whimper.\nHis hands closed around something. A tree root, sticking out from the\nearth at the very edge of the gorge. He swung in space, gasping, but his grip\nwas firm.\n'Hah!' he shouted. 'Hah!' He was still alive. It would take more than a\nfew Flatheads to put an end to Logen Ninefingers. He started to pull himself\nup onto the bank but couldn't manage it. There was some great weight\naround his legs. He peered down.\nThe gorge was deep. Very deep with sheer, rocky sides. Here and there a\ntree clung to a crack, growing out into the empty air and spreading its"

Here and there a\ntree clung to a crack, growing out into the empty air and spreading its\nleaves into space. The river hissed away far below, fast and angry, foaming\nwhite water fringed by jagged black stone. That was all bad, for sure, but\nthe real problem was closer to hand. The big Shanka was still with him,\nswinging gently back and forth with its dirty hands clamped tight around\nhis left ankle.\n'Shit,' muttered Logen. It was quite a scrape he was in. He'd been in\nsome bad ones alright, and lived to sing the songs, but it was hard to see\nhow this could get much worse. That got him thinking about his life. It\nseemed a bitter, pointless sort of a life now. No one was any better off\nbecause of it. Full of violence and pain, with not much but disappointment\nand hardship in between. His hands were starting to tire now, his forearms\nwere burning. The big Flathead didn't look like it was going to fall off any\ntime soon. In fact, it had dragged itself up his leg a way. It paused, glaring\nup at him.\nIf Logen had been the one clinging to the Shanka's foot, he would most\nlikely have thought, 'My life depends on this leg I'm hanging from—best\nnot take any chances.' A man would rather save himself than kill his enemy.\nTrouble was that the Shanka didn't think that way, and Logen knew it. So it\nwasn't much of a surprise when it opened its big mouth and sank its teeth\ninto his calf.\n'Aaaargh!' Logen grunted, and squealed and kicked out as hard as he\ncould with his bare heel, kicked a bloody gash in the Shanka's head, but it\nwouldn't stop biting, and the harder he kicked, the more his hands slipped\non the greasy root above. There wasn't much root left to hold on to, now,\nand what there was looked like snapping off any moment. He tried to think\npast the pain in his hands, the pain in his arms, the Flathead's teeth in his\nleg. He was going to fall. The only choice was between falling on rocks or\nfalling on water, and that was a choice that more or less made itself.\nOnce you've got a task to do, it's better to do it than to live with the fear\nof it. That's what Logen's father would have said. So he planted his free foot\nfirmly on the rock face, took one last deep breath, and flung himself out\ninto empty space with all the strength he had left. He felt the biting teeth let\ngo of him, then the grasping hands, and for a moment he was free.\nThen he began to fall. Fast. The sides of the gorge flashed past—grey\nrock, green moss, patches of white snow, all tumbling around him.\nLogen turned over slowly in the air, limbs flailing pointlessly, too scared\nto scream. The rushing wind whipped at his eyes, tugged at his clothes,\nplucked the breath out of his mouth. He saw the big Shanka hit the rock\nface beside him. He saw it break and bounce and flop off, dead for sure."

He saw it break and bounce and flop off, dead for sure.\nThat was a pleasing sight, but Logen's satisfaction was short-lived.\nThe water came up to meet him. It hit him in the side like a charging\nbull, punched the air out of his lungs, knocked the sense out of his head,\nsucked him in and down into the cold darkness…\nPART I\n'The blade itself\nincites to deeds\nof violence'\nHomer\nThe Survivors\n« ^ »\nThe lapping of water in his ears. That was the first thing. The lapping of\nwater, the rustling of trees, the odd click and twitter of a bird.\nLogen opened his eyes a crack. Light, blurry bright through leaves. This\nwas death? Then why did it hurt so much? His whole left side was\nthrobbing. He tried to take a proper breath, choked, coughed up water, spat\nout mud. He groaned, flopped over onto his hands and knees, dragged\nhimself up out of the river, gasping through clenched teeth, rolled onto his\nback in the moss and slime and rotten sticks at the water's edge.\nHe lay there for a moment, staring up at the grey sky beyond the black\nbranches, breath wheezing in his raw throat.\n'I am still alive,' he croaked to himself. Still alive, in spite of the best\nefforts of nature, Shanka, men and beasts. Soaking wet and flat on his back,\nhe started to chuckle. Reedy, gurgling laughter. Say one thing for Logen\nNinefingers, say he's a survivor.\nA cold wind blew across the rotting river bank, and Logen's laughter\nslowly died. Alive he might be, but staying alive, that was another question.\nHe sat up, wincing at the pain. He tottered to his feet, leaning against the\nnearest tree trunk. He scraped the dirt out of his nose, his eyes, his ears. He\npulled up his wet shirt to take a look at the damage.\nHis side was covered in bruises from the fall. Blue and purple stains all\nup his ribs. Tender to the touch, and no mistake, but it didn't feel like\nanything was broken. His leg was a mess. Torn and bloody from the\nShanka's teeth. It hurt bad, but his foot still moved well enough, and that\nwas the main thing. He'd need his foot, if he was going to get out of this.\nHe still had his knife in the sheath at his belt, and he was mightily glad\nto see it. You could never have too many knives in Logen's experience, and\nthis was a good one, but the outlook was still bleak. He was on his own, in\nwoods crawling with Flatheads. He had no idea where he was, but he could\nfollow the river. The rivers all flowed north, from the mountains to the cold\nsea. Follow the river southwards, against the current. Follow the river and\nclimb up, into the High Places where the Shanka couldn't find him. That\nwas his only chance.\nIt would be cold up there, this time of year. Deadly cold.

It was just his luck that the Shanka had come while he\nhad his boots off, trimming his blisters. No coat either—he'd been sitting\nnear the fire. Like this, he wouldn't last a day in the mountains. His hands\nand feet would turn black in the night, and he'd die bit by bit before he even\nreached the passes. If he didn't starve first.\n'Shit,' he muttered. He had to go back to the camp. He had to hope the\nFlatheads had moved on, hope they'd left something behind. Something he\ncould use to survive. That was an awful lot of hoping, but he had no choice.\nHe never had any choices.\nIt had started to rain by the time Logen found the place. Spitting drops that\nplastered his hair to his skull, kept his clothes wet through. He pressed\nhimself against a mossy trunk and peered out towards the camp, heart\npounding, fingers of his right hand curled painful tight around the slippery\ngrip of his knife.\nHe saw the blackened circle where the fire had been, half-burned sticks\nand ash trampled round it. He saw the big log Threetrees and Dow had been\nsitting on when the Flatheads came. He saw odd bits of torn and broken\ngear scattered across the clearing. He counted three dead Shanka crumpled\non the ground, one with an arrow poking out of its chest. Three dead ones,\nbut no sign of any alive. That was lucky. Just lucky enough to survive, as\nalways. Still, they might be back at any moment. He had to be quick.\nLogen scuttled out from the trees, casting about on the ground. His\nboots were still there where he'd left them. He snatched them up and\ndragged them on to his freezing feet, hopping around, almost slipping in his\nhaste. His coat was there too, wedged under the log, battered and scarred\nfrom ten years of weather and war, torn and stitched back together, missing\nhalf a sleeve. His pack was lying shapeless in the brush nearby, its contents\nstrewn out down the slope. He crouched, breathless, throwing it all back\ninside. A length of rope, his old clay pipe, some strips of dried meat, needle\nand twine, a dented flask with some liquor still sloshing inside. All good.\nAll useful.\nThere was a tattered blanket snagged on a branch, wet and half caked in\ngrime. Logen pulled it up, and grinned. His old, battered cook pot was\nunderneath. Lying on its side, kicked off the fire in the fight maybe. He\ngrabbed hold of it with both hands. It felt safe, familiar, dented and\nblackened from years of hard use. He'd had that pot a long time. It had\nfollowed him all through the wars, across the North and back again. They\nhad all cooked in it together, out on the trail, all eaten out of it. Forley,\nGrim, the Dogman, all of them.\nLogen looked over the campsite again. Three dead Shanka, but none of\nhis people. Maybe they were still out there. Maybe if he took a risk, tried to\nlook—"

        "text": "Logen looked over the campsite again. Three dead Shanka, but none of\nhis people. Maybe they were still out there. Maybe if he took a risk, tried to\nlook—\n'No.' He said it quietly, under his breath. He knew better than that. There\nhad been a lot of Flatheads. An awful lot. He had no idea how long he'd lain\non the river bank. Even if a couple of the boys had got away, the Shanka\nwould be hunting them, hunting them down in the forests. They were\nnothing but corpses now, for sure, scattered across the high valleys. All\nLogen could do was make for the mountains, and try to save his own sorry\nlife. You have to be realistic. Have to be, however much it hurts.\n'It's just you and me now,' said Logen as he stuffed the pot into his pack\nand threw it over his shoulder. He started to limp off, as fast as he could.\nUphill, towards the river, towards the mountains.\nJust the two of them. Him and the pot.\nThey were the only survivors.\nQuestions\n« ^ »\nWhy do I do this? Inquisitor Glokta asked himself for the thousandth time\nas he limped down the corridor. The walls were rendered and whitewashed,\nthough none too recently. There was a seedy feel to the place and a smell of\ndamp. There were no windows, as the hallway was deep beneath the\nground, and the lanterns cast slow flowing shadows into every corner.\nWhy would anyone want to do this? Glokta's walking made a steady\nrhythm on the grimy tiles of the floor. First the confident click of his right\nheel, then the tap of his cane, then the endless sliding of his left foot, with\nthe familiar stabbing pains in the ankle, knee, arse and back. Click, tap,\npain. That was the rhythm of his walking.\nThe dirty monotony of the corridor was broken from time to time by a\nheavy door, bound and studded with pitted iron. On one occasion, Glokta\nthought he heard a muffled cry of pain from behind one. I wonder what\npoor fool is being questioned in there? What crime they are guilty, or\ninnocent of? What secrets are being picked at, what lies cut through, what\ntreasons laid bare? He didn't wonder long though. He was interrupted by\nthe steps.\nIf Glokta had been given the opportunity to torture any one man, any\none at all, he would surely have chosen the inventor of steps. When he was\nyoung and widely admired, before his misfortunes, he had never really\nnoticed them. He had sprung down them two at a time and gone blithely on\nhis way. No more. They're everywhere. You really can't change floors\nwithout them. And down is worse than up, that's the thing people never\nrealise. Going up, you usually don't fall that far.\nHe knew this flight well. Sixteen steps, cut from smooth stone, a little\nworn toward the centre, slightly damp, like everything down here. There\nwas no banister, nothing to cling to. Sixteen enemies. A challenge indeed. It\nhad taken Glokta a long time to develop the least painful method of\ndescending stairs. He went sideways like a crab. Cane first, then left foot,"

Cane first, then left foot,\nthen right, with more than the usual agony as his left leg took his weight,\njoined by a persistent stabbing in the neck. Why should it hurt in my neck\nwhen I go down stairs? Does my neck take my weight? Does it? Yet the pain\ncould not be denied.\nGlokta paused four steps from the bottom. He had nearly beaten them.\nHis hand was trembling on the handle of his cane, his left leg aching like\nfury. He tongued his gums where his front teeth used to be, took a deep\nbreath and stepped forward. His ankle gave way with a horrifying wrench\nand he plunged into space, twisting, lurching, his mind a cauldron of horror\nand despair. He stumbled onto the next step like a drunkard, fingernails\nscratching at the smooth wall, giving a squeal of terror. You stupid, stupid\nbastard! His cane clattered to the floor, his clumsy feet wrestled with the\nstones and he found himself at the bottom, by some miracle still standing.\nAnd here it is. That horrible, beautiful, stretched out moment between\nstubbing your toe and feeling the hurt. How long do I have before the pain\ncomes? How bad will it be when it does? Gasping, slack-jawed at the foot\nof the steps, Glokta felt a tingling of anticipation. Here it comes…\nThe agony was unspeakable, a searing spasm up his left side from foot\nto jaw. He squeezed his watering eyes tight shut, clamped his right hand\nover his mouth so hard that the knuckles clicked. His remaining teeth grated\nagainst each other as he locked his jaws together, but a high-pitched, jagged\nmoan still whistled from him. Am I screaming or laughing? How do I tell\nthe difference? He breathed in heaving gasps, through his nose, snot\nbubbling out onto his hand, his twisted body shaking with the effort of\nstaying upright.\nThe spasm passed. Glokta moved his limbs cautiously, one by one,\ntesting the damage. His leg was on fire, his foot numb, his neck clicked\nwith every movement, sending vicious little stings down his spine. Pretty\ngood, considering. He bent down with an effort and snatched up his cane\nbetween two fingers, drew himself up once more, wiped the snot and tears\non the back of his hand. Truly a thrill. Did I enjoy it? For most people stairs\nare a mundane affair. For me, an adventure! He limped off down the\ncorridor, giggling quietly to himself. He was still smiling ever so faintly\nwhen he reached his own door and shuffled inside.\nA grubby white box with two doors facing each other. The ceiling was\ntoo low for comfort, the room too brightly lit by blazing lamps. Damp was\ncreeping out of one corner and the plaster had erupted with flaking blisters,\nspeckled with black mould. Someone had tried to scrub a long bloodstain\nfrom one wall, but hadn't tried nearly hard enough.\nPractical Frost was standing on the other side of the room, big arms\nfolded across his big chest.

He nodded to Glokta, with all the emotion of a\nstone, and Glokta nodded back. Between them stood a scarred, stained\nwooden table, bolted to the floor and flanked by two chairs. A naked fat\nman sat in one of them, hands tied tightly behind him and with a brown\ncanvas bag over his head. His quick, muffled breathing was the only sound.\nIt was cold down here, but he was sweating. As well he should be.\nGlokta limped over to the other chair, leaned his cane carefully against\nthe edge of the table top and slowly, cautiously, painfully sat down. He\nstretched his neck to the left and right, then allowed his body to slump into\na position approaching comfort. If Glokta had been given the opportunity to\nshake the hand of any one man, any one at all, he would surely have chosen\nthe inventor of chairs. He has made my life almost bearable.\nFrost stepped silently out of the corner and took hold of the loose top of\nthe bag between meaty, pale finger and heavy, white thumb. Glokta nodded\nand the Practical ripped it off, leaving Salem Rews blinking in the harsh\nlight.\nA mean, piggy, ugly little face. You mean, ugly pig, Rews. You disgusting\nswine. You're ready to confess right now, I'll bet, ready to talk and talk\nwithout interruption, until we're all sick of it. There was a big dark bruise\nacross his cheek and another on his jaw above his double chin. As his\nwatering eyes adjusted to the brightness he recognised Glokta sitting\nopposite him, and his face suddenly filled with hope. A sadly, sadly\nmisplaced hope.\n'Glokta, you have to help me!' he squealed, leaning forward as far as his\nbonds would allow, words bubbling out in a desperate, mumbling mess. 'I'm\nfalsely accused, you know it, I'm innocent! You've come to help me, yes?\nYou're my friend! You have influence here. We're friends, friends! You\ncould say something for me! I'm an innocent man, falsely accused! I'm—'\nGlokta held up his hand for silence. He stared at Rews' familiar face for\na moment, as though he had never laid eyes on him before. Then he turned\nto Frost. 'Am I supposed to know this man?'\nThe albino said nothing. The bottom part of his face was hidden by his\nPractical's mask, and the top half gave nothing away. He stared unblinking\nat the prisoner in the chair, pink eyes as dead as a corpse. He hadn't blinked\nonce since Glokta came into the room. How can he do that?\n'It's me, Rews!' hissed the fat man, the pitch of his voice rising steadily\ntowards panic. 'Salem Rews, you know me, Glokta! I was with you in the\nwar, before… you know… we're friends! We—'\nGlokta held up his hand again and sat back, tapping one of his few\nremaining teeth with a fingernail as though deep in thought.

A merchant, a member of the Guild of Mercers. A rich\nman by all accounts. I remember now…' Glokta leaned forward, pausing for\neffect. 'He was a traitor! He was taken by the Inquisition, his property\nconfiscated. You see, he had conspired to avoid the King's taxes.' Rews'\nmouth was hanging open. 'The King's taxes!' screamed Glokta, smashing\nhis hand down on the table. The fat man stared, wide eyed, and licked at a\ntooth. Upper right side, second from the back.\n'But where are our manners?' asked Glokta of no one in particular. 'We\nmay or may not have known each other once, but I don't think you and my\nassistant have been properly introduced. Practical Frost, say hello to this fat\nman.'\nIt was an open-handed blow, but powerful enough to knock Rews clean\nout of his seat. The chair rattled but was otherwise unaffected. How is that\ndone? To knock him to the ground but leave the chair standing? Rews\nsprawled gurgling across the floor, face flattened on the tiles.\n'He reminds me of a beached whale,' said Glokta absently. The albino\ngrabbed Rews under the arm and hauled him up, flung him back into the\nchair. Blood seeped from a cut on his cheek, but his piggy eyes were hard\nnow. Blows make most men soften up, but some men harden. I never would\nhave taken this one for a tough man, but life is full of surprises.\nRews spat blood onto the table top. 'You've gone too far here, Glokta, oh\nyes! The Mercers are an honourable guild; we have influence! They won't\nput up with this! I'm a known man! Even now my wife will be petitioning\nthe King to hear my case!'\n'Ah, your wife.' Glokta smiled sadly. 'Your wife is a very beautiful\nwoman. Beautiful, and young. I fear, perhaps, a little too young for you. I\nfear she took the opportunity to be rid of you. I fear she came forward with\nyour books. All the books.' Rews' face paled.\n'We looked at those books,' Glokta indicated an imaginary pile of papers\non his left, 'we looked at the books in the treasury,' indicating another on his\nright. 'Imagine our surprise when we could not make the numbers add up.\nAnd then there were the night-time visits by your employees to warehouses\nin the old quarter, the small unregistered boats, the payments to officials,\nthe forged documentation. Must I go on?' asked Glokta, shaking his head in\nprofound disapproval. The fat man swallowed and licked his lips.\nPen and ink were placed before the prisoner, and the paper of\nconfession, filled out in detail in Frost's beautiful, careful script, awaiting\nonly the signature.

Frost\nmoved forward, his massive shadow falling across the fat man's face. 'Body\nfound floating by the docks,' Glokta breathed, 'bloated by seawater and\nhorribly mutilated… far… far beyond recognition.' He's ready to talk. He's\nfat and ripe and ready to burst. 'Were the injuries inflicted before or after\ndeath?' he asked the ceiling breezily. 'Was the mysterious deceased a man or\na woman even?' Glokta shrugged. 'Who can say?'\nThere was a sharp knock at the door. Rews' face jerked up, filled with\nhope again. Not now, damn it! Frost went to the door, opened it a crack.\nSomething was said. The door shut, Frost leaned down to whisper in\nGlokta's ear.\n'Ith Theverar,' came the half-tongued mumble, by which Glokta\nunderstood that Severard was at the door.\nAlready? Glokta smiled and nodded, as if it was good news. Rows' face\nfell a little. How could a man whose business has been concealment find it\nimpossible to hide his emotions in this room? But Glokta knew how. It's\nhard to stay calm when you're terrified, helpless, alone, at the mercy of men\nwith no mercy at all. Who could know that better than me? He sighed, and\nusing his most world-weary tone of voice asked, 'Do you wish to confess?'\n'No!' The defiance had returned to the prisoner's piggy eyes now. He\nstared back, silent and watchful, and sucked. Surprising. Very surprising.\nBut then we're just getting started.\n'Is that tooth bothering you, Rews?' There was nothing Glokta didn't\nknow about teeth. His own mouth had been worked on by the very best. Or\nthe very worst, depending on how you look at it. 'It seems that I must leave\nyou now, but while I'm away, I'll be thinking about that tooth. I'll be\nconsidering very carefully what to do with it.' He took hold of his cane. 'I\nwant you to think about me, thinking about your tooth. And I also want you\nto think, very carefully, about signing your confession.'\nGlokta got awkwardly to his feet, shaking out his aching leg. 'I think\nyou may respond well to a straightforward beating however, so I'm going to\nleave you in the company of Practical Frost for half an hour.' Rews' mouth\nbecame a silent circle of surprise. The albino picked up the chair, fat man"

The albino picked up the chair, fat man\nand all, and turned it slowly around. 'He's absolutely the best there is at this\nkind of thing.' Frost took out a pair of battered leather gloves and began to\npull them carefully onto his big white hands, one finger at a time. 'You\nalways did like to have the very best of everything, eh, Rews?' Glokta made\nfor the door.\n'Wait! Glokta!' wailed Rews over his shoulder. 'Wait I—'\nPractical Frost clamped a gloved hand over the fat man's mouth and\nheld a finger to his mask. 'Thhhhhhh,' he said. The door clicked shut.\nSeverard was leaning against the wall in the corridor, one foot propped\non the plaster behind him, whistling tunelessly beneath his mask and\nrunning a hand through his long, lanky hair. As Glokta came through the\ndoor he straightened up and gave a little bow, and it was plain by his eyes\nthat he was smiling. He's always smiling.\n'Superior Kalyne wants to see you,' he said in his broad, common\naccent, 'and I'm of the opinion that I never saw him angrier.'\n'Severard, you poor thing, you must be terrified. Do you have the box?'\n'I do.'\n'And you took something out for Frost?'\n'I did.'\n'And something for your wife too, I hope?'\n'Oh yes,' said Severard, his eyes smiling more than ever, 'My wife will\nbe well taken care of. If I ever get one.'\n'Good. I hasten to answer the call of the Superior. When I have been\nwith him for five minutes, come in with the box.'\n'Just barge into his office?'\n'Barge in and stab him in the face for all I care.'\n'I'd consider that done, Inquisitor.'\nGlokta nodded, turned away, then turned back. 'Don't really stab him,\neh, Severard?'\nThe Practical smiled with his eyes and sheathed his vicious-looking\nknife. Glokta rolled his eyes up to the ceiling, then limped off, his cane\ntapping on the tiles, his leg throbbing. Click, tap, pain. That was the rhythm\nof his walking.\nThe Superior's office was a large and richly appointed room high up in the\nHouse of Questions, a room in which everything was too big and too fancy.\nA huge, intricate window dominated one wood-panelled wall, offering a\nview over the well-tended gardens in the courtyard below. An equally huge\nand ornate desk stood in the centre of a richly coloured carpet from\nsomewhere warm and exotic. The head of a fierce animal from somewhere\ncold and exotic was mounted above a magnificent stone fireplace with a\ntiny, mean fire close to burning out inside.\nSuperior Kalyne himself made his office look small and drab. A vast,\nflorid man in his late fifties, he had over-compensated for his thinning hair\nwith magnificent white side whiskers. He was considered a daunting\npresence even within the Inquisition, but Glokta was past scaring, and they\nboth knew it.\nThere was a big, fancy chair behind the desk, but the Superior was"

Glokta was\nseated on something which, while doubtless expensive, had clearly been\ndesigned to make its occupant as uncomfortable as possible. It doesn't\nbother me much, though. Uncomfortable is as good as I ever get.\nHe amused himself with the thought of Kalyne's head mounted above\nthe fireplace instead of that fierce animal's, while the Superior ranted at\nhim. He's every bit like his fireplace, the big dolt. Looks impressive, but\nthere's not much going on underneath. I wonder how he'd respond to an\ninterrogation? I'd start with those ridiculous side whiskers. But Glokta's\nface was a mask of attention and respect.\n'Well you've outdone yourself this time, Glokta, you mad cripple! When\nthe Mercers find out about this they'll have you flayed!'\n'I've tried flaying, it tickles.' Damn it, keep your mouth shut and smile.\nWhere's that whistling fool Severard? I'll have him flayed when I get out of\nhere.\n'Oh yes, that's good, that's very good, Glokta, look at me laugh! And\nevasion of the King's taxes?' The Superior glowered down, whiskers\nbristling. 'The King's taxes?' he screamed, spraying Glokta with spit.\n'They're all at it! The Mercers, the Spicers, all of them! Every damn fool\nwith a boat!'\n'But this was so open, Superior. It was an insult to us. I felt we had to—'\n'You felt?' Kalyne was red-faced and vibrating with rage. 'You were\nexplicitly told to keep away from the Mercers, away from the Spicers, away\nfrom all the big guilds!' He strode up and down with ever greater speed.\nYou'll wear your carpet out at this rate. The big guilds will have to buy you\na new one.\n'You felt, did you? Well he'll have to go back! We'll have to release him\nand you'll have to feel your way to a grovelling apology! It's a damn\ndisgrace! You've made me look ridiculous! Where is he now?'\n'I left him in the company of Practical Frost.'\n'With that mumbling animal?' The Superior tore at his hair in\ndesperation. 'Well that's it then, isn't it? He'll be a ruin now! We can't send\nhim back in that condition! You're finished here, Glokta! Finished! I'm\ngoing straight to the Arch Lector! Straight to the Arch Lector!'\nThe huge door was kicked open and Severard sauntered in carrying a\nwooden box. And not a moment too soon. The Superior stared, speechless,\nopen-mouthed with wrath, as Severard dropped it on the desk with a thump\nand a jingle.\n'What the hell is the meaning of…' Severard pulled open the lid, and\nKalyne saw the money.

He pursed his lips and slowly sat down.\n'Thank you, Practical Severard,' said Glokta. 'You may go.' The Superior\nwas stroking thoughtfully at his side whiskers as Severard strolled out, his\nface returning gradually to its usual shade of pink. 'Confiscated from Rews.\nThe property of the Crown now, of course. I thought that I should give it to\nyou, as my direct superior, so that you could pass it on to the Treasury' Or\nbuy a bigger desk, you leech.\nGlokta leaned forward, hands on his knees. 'You could say, perhaps, that\nRews went too far, that questions had been asked, that an example had to be\nmade. We can't be seen to do nothing, after all. It'll make the big guilds\nnervous, keep them in line.' It'll make them nervous and you can screw\nmore out of them. 'Or you could always tell them that I'm a mad cripple, and\nblame me for it.'\nThe Superior was starting to like it now, Glokta could tell. He was\ntrying not to show it, but his whiskers were quivering at the sight of all that\nmoney. 'Alright, Glokta. Alright. Very well.' He reached out and carefully\nshut the lid of the box. 'But if you ever think of doing something like this\nagain… talk to me first, would you? I don't like surprises.'\nGlokta struggled to his feet, limped towards the door. 'Oh, and one more\nthing!' He turned stiffly back. Kalyne was staring at him severely from\nbeneath his big, fancy brows. 'When I go to see the Mercers, I'll need to\ntake Rews' confession.'\nGlokta smiled broadly, showing the yawning gap in his front teeth. 'That\nshouldn't be a problem, Superior.'\nKalyne had been right. There was no way that Rews could have gone back\nin this condition. His lips were split and bloody, his sides covered in\ndarkening bruises, his head lolled sideways, face swollen almost past\nrecognition. In short, he looks like a man ready to confess.\n'I don't imagine you enjoyed the last half hour, Rews, I don't imagine\nyou enjoyed it much at all. Perhaps it was the worst half hour of your life, I\nreally couldn't say. I'm thinking about what we have for you here, though,\nand the sad fact is… that's about as good as it gets. That's the high life.'\nGlokta leaned forward, his lace just inches from the bloody pulp of Rews'\nnose. 'Practical Frost's a little girl compared to me,' he whispered. 'He's a\nkitten. Once I get started with you, Rews, you'll be looking back on this\nwith nostalgia. You'll be begging me to give you half an hour with the\nPractical. Do you understand?' Rews was silent, except for the air whistling\nthrough his broken nose.\n'Show him the instruments,' whispered Glokta.\nFrost stepped forward and opened the polished case with a theatrical"

        "text": "through his broken nose.\n'Show him the instruments,' whispered Glokta.\nFrost stepped forward and opened the polished case with a theatrical\nflourish. It was a masterful piece of craftsmanship. As the lid was pulled\nback, the many trays inside lifted and fanned out, displaying Glokta's tools\nin all their gruesome glory. There were blades of every size and shape,\nneedles curved and straight, bottles of oil and acid, nails and screws, clamps\nand pliers, saws, hammers, chisels. Metal, wood and glass glittered in the\nbright lamplight, all polished to mirror brightness and honed to a murderous\nsharpness. A big purple swelling under Rews' left eye had closed it\ncompletely, but the other darted over the instruments: terrified, fascinated.\nThe functions of some were horribly obvious, the functions of others were\nhorribly obscure. Which scare him more, I wonder?\n'We were talking about your tooth, I think,' murmured Glokta. Rews'\neye flicked up to look at him. 'Or would you like to confess?' I have him,\nhere he comes. Confess, confess, confess, confess…\nThere was a sharp knock at the door. Damn it again! Frost opened it a\ncrack and there was a brief whispering. Rews licked at his bloated lip. The\ndoor shut, the albino leaned to whisper in Glokta's ear.\n'Ith the Arth Ector.' Glokta froze. The money was not enough. While I\nwas shuffling back from Kalyne's office, the old bastard was reporting me to\nthe Arch Lector. Am I finished then? He felt a guilty thrill at the thought.\nWell, I'll see to this fat pig first.\n'Tell Severard I'm on my way.' Glokta turned back to talk to his prisoner,\nbut Frost put a big white hand on his shoulder.\n'O. The Arth Ector,' Frost pointed to the door, 'he'th ere. Ow.'\nHere? Glokta could feel his eyelid twitching. Why? He pushed himself\nup using the edge of the table. Will they find me in the canal tomorrow?\nDead and bloated, far… far beyond recognition? The only emotion that he\nfelt at the idea was a flutter of mild relief. No more stairs.\nThe Arch Lector of His Majesty's Inquisition was standing outside in\nthe corridor. The grimy walls looked almost brown behind him, so\nbrilliantly spotless were his long white coat, his white gloves, his shock of\nwhite hair. He was past sixty, but showed none of the infirmity of age.\nEvery tall, clean-shaven, fine-boned inch of him was immaculately turned\nout. He looks like a man who has never once in his life been surprised by\nanything.\nThey had met once before, six years earlier when Glokta joined the\nInquisition, and he hardly seemed to have changed. Arch Lector Sult. One\nof the most powerful men in the Union. One of the most powerful men in\nthe world, come to that. Behind him, almost like outsized shadows, loomed\ntwo enormous, silent, black-masked Practicals.\nThe Arch Lector gave a thin smile when he saw Glokta shuffle out of\nhis door.

        "text": "The Arch Lector gave a thin smile when he saw Glokta shuffle out of\nhis door. It said a lot, that smile. Mild scorn, mild pity, the very slightest\ntouch of menace. Anything but amusement. 'Inquisitor Glokta,' he said,\nholding out one white-gloved hand, palm down. A ring with a huge purple\nstone flashed on his finger.\n'I serve and obey, your Eminence.' Glokta could not help grimacing as\nhe bent slowly forward to touch his lips to the ring. A difficult and painful\nmanoeuvre, it seemed to take forever. When he finally hoisted himself back\nupright, Sult was gazing at him calmly with his cool blue eyes. A look that\nimplied he already understood Glokta completely, and was unimpressed.\n'Come with me.' The Arch Lector turned and swept away down the\ncorridor. Glokta limped along after him, the silent Practicals marching close\nbehind. Sult moved with an effortless, languid confidence, coat tails\nflapping gracefully out behind him. Bastard. Soon they reached a door,\nmuch like his own. The Arch Lector unlocked it and went inside, the\nPracticals took up positions either side of the doorway, arms folded. A\nprivate interview then. One which I, perhaps, will never leave. Glokta\nstepped over the threshold.\nA box of grubby white plaster too brightly lit and with a ceiling too low\nfor comfort. It had a big crack instead of a damp patch, but was otherwise\nidentical to his own room. It had the scarred table, the cheap chairs, it even\nhad a poorly cleaned bloodstain. I wonder if they're painted on, for the\neffect? One of the Practicals suddenly pulled the door shut with a loud bang.\nGlokta was intended to jump, but he couldn't be bothered.\nArch Lector Sult lowered himself gracefully into one of the seats, drew\na heavy sheaf of yellowing papers across the table towards him. He waved\nhis hand at the other chair, the one that would be used by the prisoner. The\nimplications were not lost on Glokta.\n'I prefer to stand, your Eminence.'\nSult smiled at him. He had lovely, pointy teeth, all shiny white. 'No, you\ndon't.'\nHe has me there. Glokta lowered himself ungracefully into the\nprisoner's chair while the Arch Lector turned over the first page of his\nwedge of documents, frowned and shook his head gently as though horribly\ndisappointed by what he saw. The details of my illustrious career, perhaps?\n'I had a visit from Superior Kalyne not long ago. He was most upset.'\nSult's hard blue eyes came up from his papers. 'Upset with you, Glokta. He\nwas quite vocal on the subject. He told me that you are an uncontrollable\nmenace, that you act without a thought for the consequences, that you are a\nmad cripple. He demanded that you be removed from his department.' The\nArch Lector smiled, a cold, nasty smile, the kind Glokta used on his\nprisoners. But with more teeth. 'I think he had it in mind that you be\nremoved… altogether.' They stared at each other across the table.\nIs this where I beg for mercy? Is this where I crawl on the ground and"

Well, I don't care enough to beg and I'm far too stiff to crawl.\nYour Practicals will have to kill me sitting down. Cut my throat. Bash my\nhead in. Whatever. As long as they get on with it.\nBut Sult was in no rush. The white-gloved hands moved neatly,\nprecisely, the pages hissed and crackled. 'We have few men like you in the\nInquisition, Glokta. A nobleman, from an excellent family. A champion\nswordsman, a dashing cavalry officer. A man once groomed for the very\ntop.' Sult looked him up and down as though he could hardly believe it.\n'That was before the war, Arch Lector.'\n'Obviously. There was much dismay at your capture, and little hope that\nyou would be returned alive. As the war dragged on and the months passed,\nhope diminished to nothing, but when the treaty was signed, you were\namong those prisoners returned to the Union.' He peered at Glokta through\nnarrowed eyes. 'Did you talk?'\nGlokta couldn't help himself, he spluttered with shrill laughter. It echoed\nstrangely in the cold room. Not a sound you often heard down here. 'Did I\ntalk? I talked until my throat was raw. I told them everything I could think\nof. I screamed every secret I'd ever heard. I babbled like a fool. When I ran\nout of things to tell them I made things up. I pissed myself and cried like a\ngirl. Everyone does.'\n'But not everyone survives. Two years in the Emperor's prisons. No one\nelse lasted half that long. The physicians were sure you would never leave\nyour bed again, but a year later you made your application to the\nInquisition.' We both know it. We were both there. What do you want from\nme, and why not get on with it? I suppose some men just love the sound of\ntheir own voices.\n'I was told that you were crippled, that you were broken, that you could\nnever be mended, that you could never be trusted. But I was inclined to give\nyou a chance. Some fool wins the Contest every year, and wars produce\nmany promising soldiers, but your achievement in surviving those two\nyears was unique. So you were sent to the North, and put in charge of one\nof our mines there. What did you make of Angland?'\nA filthy sink of violence and corruption. A prison where we have made\nslaves of the innocent and guilty alike in the name of freedom. A stinking\nhole where we send those we hate and those we are ashamed of to die of\nhunger, and disease, and hard labour. 'It was cold,' said Glokta.\n'And so were you. You made few friends in Angland. Precious few\namong the Inquisition, and none among the exiles.' He plucked a tattered\nletter from among the papers and cast a critical eye over it. 'Superior Goyle\ntold me that you were a cold fish, had no blood in you at all. He thought\nyou'd never amount to anything, that he could make no use of you.' Goyle."

I'd rather have no blood than no brains.\n'But after three years, production was up. It was doubled in fact. So you\nwere brought back to Adua, to work under Superior Kalyne. I thought\nperhaps you would learn discipline with him, but it seems I was wrong. You\ninsist on going your own way.' The Arch Lector frowned up at him. 'To be\nfrank, I think that Kalyne is afraid of you. I think they all are. They don't\nlike your arrogance, they don't like your methods, they don't like your…\nspecial insight into our work.'\n'And what do you think, Arch Lector?'\n'Honestly? I'm not sure I like your methods much either, and I doubt\nthat your arrogance is entirely deserved. But I like your results. I like your\nresults very much.' He slapped the bundle of papers closed and rested one\nhand on top of it, leaning across the table towards Glokta. As I might lean\ntowards my prisoners when I ask them to confess. 'I have a task for you. A\ntask that should make better use of your talents than chasing around after\npetty smugglers. A task that may allow you to redeem yourself in the eyes\nof the Inquisition.' The Arch Lector paused for a long moment. 'I want you\nto arrest Sepp dan Teufel.'\nGlokta frowned. Teufel? 'The Master of the Mints, your Eminence?'\n'The very same.'\nThe Master of the Royal Mints. An important man from an important\nfamily. A very big fish, to be hooked in my little tank. A fish with powerful\nfriends. It could be dangerous, arresting a man like that. It could be fatal.\n'May I ask why?'\n'You may not. Let me worry about the whys. You concentrate on\nobtaining a confession.'\n'A confession to what, Arch Lector?'\n'Why, to corruption and high treason! It seems our friend the Master of\nthe Mints has been most indiscreet in some of his personal dealings. It\nseems he has been taking bribes, conspiring with the Guild of Mercers to\ndefraud the King. As such, it would be very useful if a ranking Mercer were\nto name him, in some unfortunate connection.'\nIt can hardly be a coincidence that I have a ranking Mercer in my\ninterrogation room, even as we speak. Glokta shrugged. 'Once people start\ntalking, it's shocking the names that tumble out.'\n'Good.' The Arch Lector waved his hand. 'You may go, Inquisitor. I will\ncome for Teufel's confession this time tomorrow. You had better have it.'\nGlokta breathed slowly as he laboured back along the corridor.\nBreath in, breath out. Calm. He had not expected to leave that room\nalive. And now I find myself moving in powerful circles. A personal task for\nthe Arch Lector, squeezing a confession to high treason from one of the\nUnions most trusted officials. The most powerful of circles, but for how\nlong? Why me? Because of my results? Or because I won't be missed?"

Rews twisted his cracked and swollen\nlips into a sad smile. Smiling at a time like this, he's a marvel. But all things\nmust end. 'Let us be honest, Rews. No one is coming to help you. Not today,\nnot tomorrow, not ever. You will confess. The only choices you have are\nwhen, and the state you'll be in when you do. There's really nothing to be\ngained by putting it off. Except pain. We've got lots of that for you.'\nIt was hard to read the expression on Rews' bloody face, but his\nshoulders sagged. He dipped the pen in the ink with a trembling hand, wrote\nhis name, slightly slanted, across the bottom of the paper of confession. I\nwin again. Does my leg hurt any less? Do I have my teeth back? Has it\nhelped me to destroy this man, who I once called a friend? Then why do I\ndo this? The scratching of the nib on the paper was the only reply.\n'Excellent,' said Glokta. Practical Frost turned the document over. 'And\nthis is the list of your accomplices?' He let his eye scan lazily over the\nnames. A handful of junior Mercers, three ship's captains, an officer of the\ncity watch, a pair of minor customs officials. A tedious recipe indeed. Let us\nsee if we can add some spice. Glokta turned it around and pushed it back\nacross the table. 'Add Sepp dan Teufel's name to the list, Rews.'\nThe fat man looked confused. 'The Master of the Mints?' he mumbled,\nthrough his thick lips.\n'That's the one.'\n'But I never met the man.'\n'So?' snapped Glokta. 'Do as I tell you.' Rews paused, mouth a little\nopen. 'Write, you fat pig.' Practical Frost cracked his knuckles.\nRews licked his lips. 'Sepp… dan… Teufel,' he mumbled to himself as\nhe wrote.\n'Excellent.' Glokta carefully shut the lid on his horrible, beautiful\ninstruments. 'I'm glad for both our sakes that we won't be needing these\ntoday.'\nFrost snapped the manacles shut on the prisoner's wrists and dragged\nhim to his feet, started to march him toward the door at the back of the\nroom. 'What now?' shouted Rews over his shoulder.\n'Angland, Rews, Angland. Don't forget to pack something warm.' The\ndoor cracked shut behind him. Glokta looked at the list of names in his\nhands. Sepp dan Teufel's sat at the bottom. One name. On the face of it, just\nlike the others. Teufel. Just one more name. But such a perilous one.\nSeverard was waiting outside in the corridor, smiling as always. 'Shall I\nput the fat man in the canal?'\n'No, Severard. Put him in the next boat to Angland.'\n'You're in a merciful mood today, Inquisitor.'"

He asked himself again.\nWhy do I do this?\nNo Choice at All\n« ^ »\nLogen woke with a painful jolt. He was lying awkwardly, head twisted\nagainst something hard, knees drawn up towards his chest. He opened his\neyes a bleary crack. It was dark, but there was a faint glow coming from\nsomewhere. Light through snow.\nPanic stabbed at him. He knew where he was now. He'd piled some\nsnow in the entrance to the tiny cave, to try and keep in the warmth, such as\nit was. It must have snowed while he was sleeping, and sealed him in. If the\nfall had been a heavy one there could be a lot of snow out there. Drifts\ndeeper than a man was tall. He might never get out. He could have climbed\nall the way up out of the high valleys just to die in a hole in the rock, too\ncramped for him to even stretch out his legs.\nLogen twisted round in the narrow space as best he could, dug away at\nthe snow with his numb hands, floundering at it, grappling with it, hacking\nthrough it, mouthing breathless curses to himself. Light spilled in suddenly,\nsearing bright. He shoved the last of the snow out of the way and dragged\nhimself through into the open air.\nThe sky was a brilliant blue, the sun was blazing overhead. He turned\nhis face towards it, closed his stinging eyes and let the light wash over him.\nThe air was painful cold in his throat. Cutting cold. His mouth was dry as\ndust, his tongue a piece of wood, badly carved. He scooped up snow and\nshoved it into his mouth. It melted, he swallowed. Cold, it made his head\nhurt.\nThere was a graveyard stink coming from somewhere. Not just his own\ndamp and sour sweat smell, though that was bad enough. It was the blanket,\nstarting to rot. He had two pieces of it wrapped round his hands like\nmittens, tied round his wrists with twine, another round his head, like a\ndirty, foul-smelling hood. His boots were stuffed tight with it. The rest was\nwrapped round and round his body, under his coat. It smelled bad, but it had\nsaved his life last night, and that was a good trade to Logen's mind. It would\nstink a good deal more before he could afford to get rid of it."

It would\nstink a good deal more before he could afford to get rid of it.\nHe floundered to his feet and stared about. A narrow valley, steep sided\nand choked with snow. Three great peaks surrounded it, piles of dark grey\nstone and white snow against the blue sky. He knew them. Old friends, in\nfact. The only ones he had left. He was up in the High Places. The roof of\nthe world. He was safe.\n'Safe,' he croaked to himself, but without much joy. Safe from food,\ncertainly. Safe from warmth, without a doubt. Neither of those things would\nbe troubling him up here. He'd escaped the Shanka, maybe, but this was a\nplace for the dead, and if he stayed he'd be joining them.\nHe was brutal hungry as it was. His belly was a great, painful hole that\ncalled to him with piercing cries. He fumbled in his pack for the last strip of\nmeat. An old, brown, greasy thing like a dry twig. That would hardly fill the\ngap, but it was all he had. He tore at it with his teeth, tough as old boot\nleather, and choked it down with some snow.\nLogen shielded his eyes with his arm and looked northward down the\nvalley, the way he'd come the day before. The ground dropped slowly away,\nsnow and rock giving way to the pine-covered fells of the high valleys,\ntrees giving way to a crinkled strip of grazing land, grassy hills giving way\nto the sea, a sparkling line on the far horizon. Home. The thought of it made\nLogen feel sick.\nHome. That was where his family was. His father—wise and strong, a\ngood man, a good leader to his people. His wife, his children. They were a\ngood family. They deserved a better son, a better husband, a better father.\nHis friends were there too. Old and new together. It would be good to see\nthem all again, very good. To speak to his father in the long hall. To play\nwith his children, to sit with his wife by the river. To talk of tactics with\nThreetrees. To hunt with the Dogman in the high valleys, crashing through\nthe forest with a spear, laughing like a fool.\nLogen felt a sudden painful longing. He nearly choked on the pain of it.\nTrouble was, they were all dead. The hall was a ring of black splinters, the\nriver a sewer. He'd never forget coming over the hill, seeing the burnt-out\nruin in the valley below. Crawling through the ashes, fumbling for signs\nthat someone got away, while the Dogman pulled at his shoulder and told\nhim to give it up. Nothing but corpses, rotted past knowing. He was done\nlooking for signs. They were all dead as the Shanka could make them, and\nthat was dead for sure. He spat in the snow, brown spit from the dry meat.\nDead and cold and rotted, or burned to ashes. Gone back to the mud.\nLogen set his jaw and clenched his fists under the rotten shreds of\nblanket. He could go back to the ruins of the village by the sea, just one last\ntime. He could charge down with a fighting roar in his throat, the way he"

He could charge down with a fighting roar in his throat, the way he\nhad done at Carleon, when he'd lost a finger and won a reputation. He could\nput a few Shanka out of the world. Split them like he'd split Shama\nHeartless, shoulder to guts so his insides fell out. He could get vengeance\nfor his father, his wife, his children, his friends. That would be a fitting end\nfor the one they called the Bloody-Nine. To die killing. That might be a\nsong worth the singing.\nBut at Carleon he'd been young and strong, and with his friends behind\nhim. Now he was weak, and hungry, and alone as could be. He'd killed\nShama Heartless with a long sword, sharp as anything. He looked down at\nhis knife. It might be a good one, but he'd get precious little vengeance with\nit. And who'd sing the song anyway? The Shanka had poor singing voices\nand worse imaginations, if they even recognised the stinking beggar in the\nblanket after they'd shot him full of arrows. Perhaps the vengeance could\nwait, at least until he had a bigger blade to work with. You have to be\nrealistic, after all.\nSouth then, and become a wanderer. There was always work for a man\nwith his skills. Hard work perhaps, and dark, but work all the same. There\nwas an appeal in it, he had to admit. To have no one depending on him but\nhimself, for his decisions to hold no importance, for no one's life or death to\nbe in his hands. He had enemies in the south, that was a fact. But the\nBloody-Nine had dealt with enemies before.\nHe spat again. Now that he had some spit he thought he might make the\nmost of it. It was about all he did have—spit, an old pot, and some stinking\nbits of blanket. Dead in the north or alive in the south. That was what it\ncame down to, and that was no choice at all.\nYou carry on. That's what he'd always done. That's the task that comes\nwith surviving, whether you deserve to live or not. You remember the dead\nas best you can. You say some words for them. Then you carry on, and you\nhope for better.\nLogen took in a long, cold breath, and blew it out. 'Fare you well, my\nfriends,' he muttered. 'Fare you well.' Then he threw his pack over his\nshoulder, turned, and began to flounder through the deep snow.\nDownwards, southwards, out of the mountains.\nIt was raining, still. A soft rain that coated everything in cold dew, collected\non the branches, on the leaves, on the needles, and dripped off in great fat\ndrops that soaked through Logen's wet clothes and onto his wet skin.\nHe squatted, still and silent, in the damp brush, water running down his\nface, the bright blade of his knife glistening with wet. He felt the great\nmotion of the forest and heard all its thousand sounds. The countless\ncrawling of the insects, the blind scuttling of the moles, the timid rustling of\nthe deer, the slow pulsing of the sap in the old tree trunks. Each thing alive"

Each thing alive\nin the forest was in search of its own kind of food, and he was the same. He\nlet his mind settle on an animal close to him, moving cautiously through the\nwoods to his right. Delicious. The forest grew silent but for the endless\ndripping of water from the branches. The world shrank down to Logen and\nhis next meal.\nWhen he reckoned it was close enough, he sprang forward and bore it\ndown onto the wet ground. A young deer. It kicked and struggled but he was\nstrong and quick, and he stabbed his knife into its neck and chopped the\nthroat out. Hot blood surged from the wound, spilled out across Logen's\nhands, onto the wet earth.\nHe picked up the carcass and slung it over his shoulders. That would be\ngood in a stew, maybe with some mushrooms. Very good. Then, once he'd\neaten, he would ask the spirits for guidance. Their guidance was pretty\nuseless, but the company would be welcome.\nWhen he reached his camp it was close to sunset. It was a dwelling fit\nfor a hero of Logen's stature—two big sticks holding a load of damp\nbranches over a hollow in the dirt. Still, it was halfway dry in there, and the\nrain had stopped. He would have a fire tonight. It was a long time since he'd\nhad a treat like that. A fire, and all his own.\nLater, well fed and rested, Logen pressed a lump of chagga into his\npipe. He'd found it growing a few days before at the base of a tree, big\nmoist yellow discs of it. He'd broken off a good chunk for himself, but it\nhadn't dried out enough to smoke until today. Now he took a burning twig\nfrom the fire and stuck it in the bowl, puffing away hard until the fungus\ncaught and began to burn, giving off its familiar earthy-sweet smell.\nLogen coughed, blew out brown smoke and stared into the shifting\nflames. His mind went back to other times and other campfires. The\nDogman was there, grinning, the light gleaming on his pointy teeth. Tul\nDuru was sitting opposite, big as a mountain, laughing like thunder. Forley\nthe Weakest too, with those nervous eyes darting around, always a little\nscared. Rudd Threetrees was there, and Harding Grim, saying nothing. He\nnever did say anything. That was why they called him Grim.\nThey were all there. Only they weren't. They were all dead, gone back\nto the mud. Logen tapped the pipe out into the fire and shoved it away. He\nhad no taste for it now. His father had been right. You should never smoke\nalone.\nHe unscrewed the cap of the battered flask, took a mouthful, and blew it\nout in a spray of tiny drops. A gout of flame went up into the cold air. Logen\nwiped his lips, savouring the hot, bitter taste. Then he sat back against the\nknotted trunk of a pine, and waited.\nIt was a while before they came. Three of them. They came silently\nfrom the dancing shadows among the trees and made slowly for the fire,"

They came silently\nfrom the dancing shadows among the trees and made slowly for the fire,\ntaking shape as they moved into the light.\n'Ninefingers,' said the first.\n'Ninefingers,' the second.\n'Ninefingers,' the third, voices like the thousand sounds of the forest.\n'You're right welcome to my fire,' said Logen. The spirits squatted and\nstared at him without expression. 'Only three tonight?'\nThe one on the right spoke first. 'Every year fewer of us wake from the\nwinter. We are all that remain. A few more winters will pass, and we will\nsleep also. There will be none of us left to answer your call.'\nLogen nodded sadly. 'Any news from the world?'\n'We heard a man fell off a cliff but washed up alive, then crossed the\nHigh Places at the start of spring, wrapped in a rotten blanket, but we put no\nfaith in such rumours.'\n'Very wise.'\n'Bethod has been making war,' said the spirit in the centre.\nLogen frowned. 'Bethod is always making war. That's what he does.'\n'Yes. He has won so many fights now, with your help, he has given\nhimself a golden hat.'\n'Shit on that bastard,' said Logen, spitting into the fire. 'What else?'\n'North of the mountains, the Shanka run around and burn things.'\n'They love the fire,' said the spirit in the centre.\n'They do,' said the one on the left, 'even more than your kind,\nNinefingers. They love and fear it.' The spirit leaned forwards. 'We heard\nthere is a man seeking for you in the moors to the south.'\n'A powerful man,' said the one in the centre.\n'A Magus of the Old Time,' the one on the left.\nLogen frowned. He'd heard of these Magi. He met a sorcerer once, but\nhe'd been easy to kill. No unnatural powers in particular, not that Logen had\nnoticed. But a Magus was something else.\n'We heard that the Magi are wise and strong,' said the spirit in the\ncentre, 'and that such a one could take a man far and show him many things.\nBut they are crafty too, and have their own purposes.'\n'What does he want?'\n'Ask him.' Spirits cared little for the business of men, they were always\nweak on the details. Still, this was better than the usual talk about trees.\n'What will you do, Ninefingers?'\nLogen considered a moment. 'I will go south and find this Magus, and\nask him what he wants from me.'\nThe spirits nodded. They didn't show whether they thought it was a\ngood idea or bad. They didn't care.\n'Farewell then, Ninefingers,' said the spirit on the right, 'perhaps for the\nlast time.'\n'I'll try to struggle on without you.'\nLogen's wit was wasted on them. They rose and moved away from the\nfire, fading gradually into the darkness. Soon they were gone, but Logen\nhad to admit they had been more use than he dared to hope. They had given\nhim a purpose.\nHe would head south in the morning, head south and find this Magus."

He might be a good talker. Had to be better than being shot full\nof arrows for nothing, at least. Logen looked into the flames, nodding\nslowly to himself.\nHe remembered other times and other campfires, when he had not been\nalone.\nPlaying With Knives\n« ^ »\nIt was a beautiful spring day in Adua, and the sun shone pleasantly through\nthe branches of the aromatic cedar, casting a dappled shade on the players\nbeneath. A pleasing breeze fluttered through the courtyard, so the cards\nwere clutched tightly or weighted down with glasses or coins. Birds\ntwittered from the trees, and the shears of a gardener clacked across from\nthe far side of the lawn, making faint, agreeable echoes against the tall\nwhite buildings of the quadrangle. Whether or not the players found the\nlarge sum of money in the centre of the table pleasant depended, of course,\non the cards they held.\nCaptain Jezal dan Luthar certainly liked it. He had discovered an\nuncanny talent for the game since he gained his commission in the King's\nOwn, a talent which he had used to win large sums of money from his\ncomrades. He didn't really need the money, of course, coming from such a\nwealthy family, but it had allowed him to maintain an illusion of thrift while\nspending like a sailor. Whenever Jezal went home, his father bored\neveryone on the subject of his good fiscal planning, and had rewarded him\nby buying his Captaincy just six months ago. His brothers had not been\nhappy. Yes, the money was certainly useful, and there's nothing half so\namusing as humiliating one's closest friends.\nJezal half sat, half lay back on his bench with one leg stretched out, and\nallowed his eyes to wander over the other players. Major West had rocked\nhis chair so far onto its back legs that he looked in imminent danger of\ntipping over entirely. He was holding his glass up to the sun, admiring the\nway that the light filtered through the amber spirit inside. He had a faint,\nmysterious smile which seemed to say, 'I am not a nobleman, and may be\nyour social inferior, but I won a Contest and the King's favour on the\nbattlefield and that makes me the better man, so you children will damn\nwell do as I say.' He was out of this hand though, and, in Jezal's opinion, far\ntoo cautious with his money anyway.\nLieutenant Kaspa was sitting forward, frowning and scratching his\nsandy beard, staring intently at his cards as though they were sums he didn't\nunderstand. He was a good-humoured young man but an oaf of a card\nplayer, and was always most appreciative when Jezal bought him drinks\nwith his own money. Still, he could well afford to lose it: his father was one\nof the biggest landowners in the Union.\nJezal had often observed that the ever so slightly stupid will act more\nstupidly in clever company.

Having lost the high ground already they\nscramble eagerly for the position of likeable idiot, stay out of arguments\nthey will only lose, and can hence be everyone's friend. Kaspa's look of\nbaffled concentration seemed to say, 'I am not clever, but honest and\nlikeable, which is much more important. Cleverness is overrated. Oh, and\nI'm very, very rich, so everyone likes me regardless.'\n'I believe I'll stay with you,' said Kaspa, and tossed a small stack of\nsilver coins onto the table. They broke and flashed in the sun with a\ncheerful jingle. Jezal absently added up the total in his head. A new uniform\nperhaps? Kaspa always got a little quivery when he really held good cards,\nand he was not trembling now. To say that he was bluffing was to give him\nfar too much credit; more likely he was simply bored with sitting out. Jezal\nhad no doubt that he would fold up like a cheap tent on the next round of\nbetting.\nLieutenant Jalenhorm scowled and tossed his cards onto the able. 'I've\nhad nothing but shit today!' he rumbled. He sat back in his chair and\nhunched his brawny shoulders with a frown that aid, 'I am big and manly,\nand have a quick temper, so I should be treated with respect by everyone.'\nRespect was precisely what Jezal never gave him at the card table. A bad\ntemper might be useful in a fight, but it's a liability where money is\nconcerned, it was a shame his hand hadn't been a little better, or Jezal\ncould've allied him out of half his pay. Jalenhorm drained his glass and\nreached for the bottle.\nThat just left Brint, the youngest and poorest of the group. He licked his\nlips with an expression at once careful and slightly desperate, an expression\nwhich seemed to say, 'I am not young or poor. I can afford to lose this\nmoney. I am every bit as important as the rest of you.' He had a lot of\nmoney today; perhaps his allowance had just come in. Perhaps that was all\nhe had to live on for the next couple of months. Jezal planned to take that\nmoney away from him and waste it all on women and drink. He had to stop\nhimself giggling at the thought. He could giggle when he'd won the hand.\nBrint sat back and considered carefully. He might be some time making his\ndecision, so Jezal took his pipe from the table.\nHe lit it at the lamp provided especially for that purpose and blew\nragged smoke rings up into the branches of the cedar. He wasn't half as\ngood at smoking as he was at cards, unfortunately, and most of the rings\nwere no more than ugly puffs of yellow-brown vapour. If he was being\ncompletely honest, he didn't really enjoy smoking. It made him feel a bit\nsick, but it was very fashionable and very expensive, and Jezal would be\ndamned if he would miss out on something fashionable just because he\ndidn't like it.

Besides, his father had bought him a beautiful ivory pipe the\nlast time he was in the city, and it looked very well on him. His brothers had\nnot been happy about that either, come to think of it.\n'I'm in,' said Brint.\nJezal swung his leg off the bench. 'Then I raise you a hundred marks or\nso.' He shoved his whole stack into the centre of the table. West sucked air\nthrough his teeth. A coin fell from the top of the pile, landed on its edge and\nrolled along the wood. It dropped to the flags beneath with the\nunmistakeable sound of falling money. The head of the gardener on the\nother side of the lawn snapped up instinctively, before he returned to his\nclipping of the grass.\nKaspa shoved his cards away as though they were burning his fingers\nand shook his head. 'Damn it but I'm an oaf of a card player,' he lamented,\nand leaned back against the rough brown trunk of the tree.\nJezal stared straight at Lieutenant Brint, a slight smile on his face,\ngiving nothing away. 'He's bluffing,' rumbled Jalenhorm, 'don't let him push\nyou around, Brint.'\n'Don't do it, Lieutenant,' said West, but Jezal knew he would. He had to\nlook as if he could afford to lose. Brint didn't hesitate, he pushed all his own\ncoins in with a careless flourish.\n'That's a hundred, give or take.' Brint was trying his hardest to sound\nmasterful in front of the older officers, but his voice had a charming note of\nhysteria.\n'Good enough,' said Jezal, 'we're all friends here. What do you have,\nLieutenant?'\n'I have earth.' Brint's eyes had a slightly feverish look to them as he\nshowed his cards to the group.\nJezal savoured the tense atmosphere. He frowned, shrugged, raised his\neyebrows. He scratched his head thoughtfully. He watched Brint's\nexpression change as he changed his own. Hope, despair, hope, despair. At\nlength Jezal spread his cards out on the table. 'Oh look. I have suns, again.'\nBrint's face was a picture. West gave a sigh and shook his head.\nJalenhorm frowned. 'I was sure he was bluffing,' he said.\n'How does he do it?' asked Kaspa, flicking a stray coin across the table.\nJezal shrugged. 'It's all about the players, and nothing about the cards.'\nHe began to scoop up the heap of silver while Brint looked on, teeth gritted,\nface pale. The money jingled into the bag with a pleasant sound. Pleasant to\nJezal, anyway. A coin dropped from the table and fell next to Brint's boot.\n'You couldn't fetch that for me could you Lieutenant?' asked Jezal, with a\nsyrupy smile.\nBrint stood up quickly, knocking into the table and making the coins\nand glasses jump and rattle.

He disappeared into the\nofficers' quarters, head down.\n'Did you see that?' Jezal was becoming ever more indignant with each\npassing moment. 'Barging me like that, it's damn impolite! And me his\nsuperior officer as well! I've a good mind to put him on report!' A chorus of\ndisapproving sounds greeted this mention of reports. 'Well, he's a bad loser\nis all!'\nJalenhorm looked sternly out from beneath his brows. 'You shouldn't\nbite him so hard. He isn't rich. He can't afford to lose.'\n'Well if he can't afford to lose he shouldn't play!' snapped Jezal, upset.\n'Who's the one told him I was bluffing? You should keep your big mouth\nshut!'\n'He's new here,' said West, 'he just wants to fit in. Weren't you new\nonce?'\n'What are you, my father?' Jezal remembered being new with painful\nclarity, and the mention of it made him feel just a little ashamed.\nKaspa waved his hand. 'I'll lend him some money, don't worry'\n'He won't take it,' said Jalenhorm.\n'Well, that's his business.' Kaspa closed his eyes and turned his face up\nto the sun. 'Hot. Winter is truly over. Must be getting past midday.'\n'Shit!' shouted Jezal, starting up and gathering his things. The gardener\npaused in his trimming of the lawn and looked over at them. 'Why didn't\nyou say something, West?'\n'What am I, your father?' asked the Major. Kaspa sniggered.\n'Late again,' said Jalenhorm, blowing out his cheeks. 'The Lord Marshal\nwill not be happy!'\nJezal snatched up his fencing steels and ran for the far side of the lawn.\nMajor West ambled after him. 'Come on!' shouted Jezal.\n'I'm right behind you, Captain,' he said. 'Right behind you.'\n'Jab, jab, Jezal, jab, jab!' barked Lord Marshal Varuz, whacking him on the\narm with his stick.\n'Ow,' yelped Jezal, and hefted the metal bar again.\n'I want to see that right arm moving, Captain, darting like a snake! I\nwant to be blinded by the speed of those hands!'\nJezal made a couple more clumsy lunges with the unwieldy lump of\niron. It was utter torture. His fingers, his wrist, his forearm, his shoulder,\nwere burning with the effort. He was soaked to the skin with sweat; it flew\nfrom his face in big drops. Marshal Varuz flicked his feeble efforts away.\n'Now, cut! Cut with the left!'\nJezal swung the big smith's hammer at the old man's head with all the\nstrength in his left arm. He could barely lift the damn thing on a good day.\nMarshal Varuz stepped effortlessly aside and whacked him in the face with\nthe stick."

He felt a stinging pain as Varuz whacked\nhim across the arse, the sharp smack echoing across the courtyard, and he\nsprawled onto his face.\n'That's pitiful!' shouted the old man. 'You are embarrassing me in front\nof Major West!' The Major had rocked his chair back and was shaking with\nmuffled laughter. Jezal stared at the Marshal's immaculately polished boots,\nseeing no pressing need to get up.\n'Up, Captain Luthar!' shouted Varuz. 'My time at least is valuable!'\n'Alright! Alright!' Jezal clambered wearily to his feet and stood there\nswaying in the hot sun, panting for air, running with sweat.\nVaruz stepped close to him and sniffed at his breath. 'Have you been\ndrinking today already?' he demanded, his grey moustaches bristling. 'And\nlast night too, no doubt!' Jezal had no reply. 'Well damn you, then! We have\nwork to do, Captain Luthar, and I cannot do it alone! Four months until the\nContest, four months to make a master swordsman of you!'\nVaruz waited for a reply, but Jezal could not think of one.

Varuz barked in Jezal's face, and turned away, stick clenched\ntight behind him in both hands.\n'Marshal Var—' Jezal began, but before he could finish the old soldier\nspan around and jabbed him right in the stomach.\n'Gargh,' said Jezal as he sank to his knees. Varuz stood over him.\n'You are going to go on a little run for me, Captain.'\n'Aaaargh.'\n'You are going to run from here to the Tower of Chains. You are going\nto run up the tower to the parapet.

You will run as\nfast as you can, and I know this to be true, because if you have not returned\nby the time we have finished our game, you will go again.' Jezal winced.\n'Major West is an excellent hand at squares, so it should take me half an\nhour to beat him. I suggest you begin at once.'"

I suggest you begin at once.'\nJezal lurched to his feet and jogged toward the archway at the far side of\nthe courtyard, muttering curses.\n'You'll need to go faster than that, Captain!' Varuz called after him.\nJezal's legs were blocks of lead, but he urged them on.\n'Knees up!' shouted Major West cheerily.\nJezal clattered down the passageway, past a smirking porter sitting by\nthe door, and out onto the broad avenue beyond. He jogged past the ivy-\ncovered walls of the University, cursing the names of Varuz and West under\nhis heaving breath, then by the near windowless mass of the House of\nQuestions, its heavy front gate sealed tight. He passed a few colourless\nclerks hurrying this way and that, but the Agriont was quiet at this time of\nthe afternoon, and Jezal saw nobody of interest until he passed into the\npark.\nThree fashionable young ladies were sitting in the shade of a spreading\nwillow by the lake, accompanied by an elderly chaperone. Jezal upped his\npace immediately, and replaced his tortured expression with a nonchalant\nsmile.\n'Ladies,' he said as he flashed past. He heard them giggling to one\nanother behind him and silently congratulated himself, but slowed to half\nthe speed as soon as he was out of sight.\n'Varuz be damned,' he said to himself, nearly walking as he turned onto\nthe Kingsway, but had to speed up again straight away. Crown Prince\nLadisla was not twenty strides off, holding forth to his enormous, brightly\ncoloured retinue.\n'Captain Luthar!' shouted his Highness, sunlight flashing off his\noutrageous golden buttons, 'run for all you're worth! I have a thousand\nmarks on you to win the Contest!'\nJezal had it on good authority that the Prince had backed Bremer dan\nGorst to the tune of two thousand marks, but he still bowed as low as he\npossibly could while running. The prince's entourage of dandies cheered\nand shouted half-hearted encouragements at his receding back. 'Bloody\nidiots,' hissed Jezal under his breath, but he would have loved to be one of\nthem.\nHe passed the huge stone effigies of six hundred years of High Kings on\nhis right, the statues of their loyal retainers, slightly smaller, on his left. He\nnodded to the great Magus Bayaz just before he turned into the Square of\nMarshals, but the wizard frowned back as disapprovingly as ever, the awe-\ninspiring effect only slightly diminished by a streak of white pigeon shit on\nhis stony cheek.\nWith the Open Council in session the square was almost empty, and\nJezal was able to amble over to the gate of the Halls Martial. A thick set\nsergeant nodded to him as he passed through, and Jezal wondered whether\nhe might be from his own company—the common soldiers all looked the\nsame, after all. He ignored the man and ran on between the towering white\nbuildings.\n'Perfect,' muttered Jezal. Jalenhorm and Kaspa were sitting by the door"

'Don't keep the Lord Marshal waiting!' he shouted\nfrom behind, and Jezal heard the big man roaring with amusement.\n'Bloody idiots,' panted Jezal, shouldering open the heavy door, breath\nrasping as he started up the steep spiral staircase. It was one of the highest\ntowers in the Agriont: there were two hundred and ninety-one steps in all.\n'Bloody steps,' he cursed to himself. By the time he reached the hundredth\nhis legs were burning and his chest was heaving. By the time he reached the\ntwo-hundredth he was a wreck. He walked the rest of the way, every\nfootfall torture, and eventually burst out through a turret onto the roof and\nleaned on the parapet, blinking in the sudden brightness.\nTo the south the city was spread out below him, an endless carpet of\nwhite houses stretching all around the glittering bay. In the other direction,\nthe view over the Agriont was even more impressive. A great confusion of\nmagnificent buildings piled one upon the other, broken up by green lawns\nand great trees, circled by its wide moat and its towering wall, studded with\na hundred lofty towers. The Kingsway sliced straight through the centre\ntoward the Lords' Round, its bronze dome shining in the sunlight. The tall\nspires of the University stood behind, and beyond them loomed the grim\nimmensity of the House of the Maker, rearing high over all like a dark\nmountain, casting its long shadow across the buildings below.\nJezal fancied that he saw the sun glint on Marshal Varuz' eyeglass in the\ndistance. He cursed once again and made for the stairs.\nJezal was immensely relieved when he finally made it to the roof and saw\nthat there were still a few white pieces on the board.\nMarshal Varuz frowned up at him. 'You are very lucky. The Major has\nput up an exceptionally determined defence.' A smile broke West's features.\n'You must somehow have earned his respect, even if you have yet to win\nmine.'\nJezal bent over with his hands on his knees, blowing hard and dripping\nsweat onto the floor. Varuz took the long case from the table, walked over to\nJezal and flipped it open. 'Show us your forms.'\nJezal took the short steel in his left hand and the long in his right. They\nfelt light as feathers after the heavy iron. Marshal Varuz backed away a\nstep. 'Begin.'\nHe snapped into the first form, right arm extended, left close to the\nbody. The blades swished and weaved through the air, glittering in the\nafternoon sun as Jezal moved from one familiar stance to the next with a\npractised smoothness. At length he was finished, and he let the steels drop\nto his sides.\nVaruz nodded. 'The Captain has fast hands, has he not?'"

'The Captain has fast hands, has he not?'\n'Truly excellent,' said Major West, smiling broadly. 'A damn sight better\nthan ever I was.'\nThe Lord Marshal was less impressed. 'Your knees are too far bent in\nthe third form, and you must strive for more extension on the left arm in the\nfourth, but otherwise,' he paused, 'passable.' Jezal breathed a sigh of relief.\nThat was high praise indeed.\n'Hah!' shouted the old man, striking him in the ribs with the end of the\ncase. Jezal sank to the floor, hardly able to breathe. 'Your reflexes need\nwork, though, Captain. You should always be ready. Always. If you have\nsteels in your hands, you damn well keep them up.'\n'Yes, sir,' croaked Jezal.\nAnd your stamina is a disgrace, you are blowing like a carp. I have it on\ngood authority that Bremer dan Gorst runs ten miles a day, and barely\nshows a sweat.' Marshal Varuz leaned down over him. 'From now on you\nwill do the same. Oh yes. A circuit of the wall of the Agriont every morning\nat six, followed by an hour of sparring with Major West, who has been kind\nenough to agree to act as your partner. I am confident that he will point up\nall the little weaknesses in your technique.'\nJezal winced and rubbed his aching ribs. 'As for the carousing, I want an\nend to it. I am all for revelry in its proper place, but there will be time for\ncelebration after the Contest, providing you have worked hard enough to\nwin. Until then, clean living is what we need. Do you understand me,\nCaptain Luthar?' He leaned down further, pronouncing every word with\ngreat care. 'Clean. Living. Captain.'\n'Yes, Marshal Varuz,' mumbled Jezal.\nSix hours later he was drunker than shit. Laughing like a lunatic he plunged\nout into the street, head spinning. The cold air slapped him hard in the face,\nthe mean little buildings weaved and swayed, the ill-lit road tipped like a\nsinking ship. Jezal wrestled manfully with the urge to vomit, took a\nswaggering step out into the street, turned to face the door. Smeary bright\nlight and loud sounds of laughter and shouting washed out at him.

He hit the ground with a bone-jarring crash.\nThe world was dark for a moment, then he found himself squashed into\nthe dirt with Kaspa on top of him. 'Damn it!' he gurgled, tongue thick and\nclumsy in his mouth. He shoved the giggling Lieutenant away with his\nelbow, rolled over and lurched up, stumbling about as the street see-sawed\naround him.

'Damn it!' he mumbled again. 'When had that happened?'\nHe became aware of some shouting on the other side of the road. Two\nmen grappling in a doorway. Jezal squinted hard, strained against the\ngloom. A big man had hold of some well-dressed fellow, and seemed to be\ntying his hands behind his back. Now he was forcing some kind of bag over\nhis head. Jezal blinked in disbelief. It was far from a reputable area, but this\nseemed somewhat strong.\nThe door of the tavern banged open and West and Jalenhorm came out,\ndeep in drunken conversation, something about someone's sister. Bright\nlight cut across the street and illuminated the two struggling men starkly.\nThe big one was dressed all in black, with a mask over the lower part of his\nface. He had white hair, white eyebrows, skin white as milk. Jezal stared at\nthe white devil across the road, and he glared back with narrowed pink\neyes.\n'Help!' It was the fellow with the bag on his head, his voice shrill with\nfear. 'Help, I am—' The white man dealt him a savage blow in the midriff\nand he folded up with a sigh.\n'You there!' shouted West.\nJalenhorm was already rushing across the street.\n'What?' said Kaspa, propped up on his elbows in the road.\nJezal's mind was full of mud, but his feet seemed to be following\nJalenhorm, so he stumbled along with them, feeling very sick. West came\nbehind him. The white ghost started up and turned to stand between them\nand his prisoner. Another man moved briskly out of the shadows, tall and\nthin, dressed all in black and masked, but with long greasy hair. He held up\na gloved hand.\n'Gentlemen,' his whining commoner's voice was muffled by his mask,\n'gentlemen please, we're on the Bang's business!'\n'The King conducts his business in the day-time,' growled Jalenhorm.\nThe new arrival's mask twitched slightly as he smiled. 'That's why he\nneeds us for the night-time stuff, eh, friend?'\n'Who is this man?' West was pointing at the fellow with the bag on his\nhead.\nThe prisoner was struggling up again. 'I am Sepp dan—oof!' The white\nmonster silenced him with a heavy fist in the face, knocking him limp into\nthe road.\nJalenhorm put a hand on the hilt of his sword, jaw clenching, and the\nwhite ghost loomed forward with a terrible speed. Close up he was even\nmore massive, alien, and terrifying. Jalenhorm took an involuntary step\nback, stumbled on the rutted surface of the road and pitched onto his back\nwith a crash. Jezal's head was thumping.\n'Back!' bellowed West. His sword whipped out of its scabbard with a\nfaint ringing.\n'Thaaaaah!' hissed the monster, fists clenched like two big white rocks.\n'Aargh,' gurgled the man with the bag on his head."

He looked at the thin man. The thin\nman's eyes smiled back. How could anyone smile at a time like this? Jezal\nwas surprised to see that he had a long, ugly knife in his hand. Where did\nthat come from? He fumbled drunkenly for his sword.\n'Major West!' came a voice from the shadows down the street, Jezal\npaused, uncertain, steel halfway out. Jalenhorm scrambled to his feet, the\nback of his uniform crusted with mud, pulled out his own sword. The pale\nmonster stared at them unblinking, not retreating a finger's breadth.\n'Major West!' came the voice again, accompanied now by a clicking,\nscraping sound. West's face had turned pale. A figure emerged from the\nshadows, limping badly, cane tapping on the dirt. His broad-brimmed hat\nobscured the upper part of his face, but his mouth was twisted into a strange\nsmile. Jezal noticed with a sudden wave of nausea that his four front teeth\nwere missing. He shuffled towards them, ignoring all the naked steel, and\noffered his free hand to West.\nThe Major slowly sheathed his sword, took the hand and shook it\nlimply. 'Colonel Glokta?' he asked in a husky voice.\n'Your humble servant, though I'm no longer an army man. I'm with the\nKing's Inquisition now.' He reached up slowly and removed his hat. His\nface was deathly pale, deeply lined, close-cropped hair scattered with grey.\nHis eyes stared out feverish bright from deep, dark rings, the left one\nnoticeably narrower than the right, pink-rimmed and glistening wet. 'And\nthese are my assistants, Practicals Severard,' the lanky one gave a mockery\nof a bow, 'and Frost.'\nThe white monster jerked the prisoner to his feet with one hand. 'Hold\non,' said Jalenhorm, stepping forward, but the Inquisitor put a gentle hand\non his arm.\n'This man is a prisoner of His Majesty's Inquisition, Lieutenant\nJalenhorm.' The big man paused, surprised to be called by name. 'I realise\nyour motives are of the best, but he is a criminal, a traitor. I have a warrant\nfor him, signed by Arch Lector Sult himself. He is most unworthy of your\nassistance, believe me.'\nJalenhorm frowned and stared balefully at Practical Frost. The pale\ndevil looked terrified. About as terrified as a stone. He hauled the prisoner\nover his shoulder without apparent effort and turned up the street. The one\ncalled Severard smiled with his eyes, sheathed his knife, bowed again and\nfollowed his companion, whistling tunelessly as he sauntered off.\nThe Inquisitor's left eyelid began to flutter and tears rolled down his\npale cheek. He wiped it carefully on the back of his hand. 'Please forgive\nme. Honestly. It's coming to something when a man can't control his own\neyes, eh? Damn weeping jelly.

Jezal's stomach roiled. 'How long has it been,\nWest? Seven years? Eight?'\nA muscle was working on the side of the Major's head. 'Nine.'\n'Imagine that. Nine years. Can you believe it? It seems like only\nyesterday. It was on the ridge, wasn't it, where we parted?'\n'On the ridge, yes.'\n'Don't worry, West, I don't blame you in the least.' Glokta slapped the\nMajor warmly on the arm. 'Not for that, anyway. You tried to talk me out of\nit, I remember. I had time enough to think about it in Gurkhul, after all. Lots\nof time to think. You were always a good friend to me. And now young\nCollem West, a Major in the King's Own, imagine that.' Jezal had not the\nslightest idea what they were talking about. He wanted only to be sick, then\ngo to bed.\nInquisitor Glokta turned toward him with a smile, displaying once again\nthe hideous gap in his teeth. 'And this must be Captain Luthar, for whom\neveryone has such high hopes in the coming Contest. Marshal Varuz is a\nhard master, is he not?' He waved his cane weakly at Jezal. 'Jab, jab, eh,\nCaptain? Jab, jab.'\nJezal felt his bile rising. He coughed and looked down at his feet,\nwilling the world to remain motionless. The Inquisitor looked around\nexpectantly at each of them in turn. West looked pale. Jalenhorm mud-\nstained and sulky. Kaspa was still sitting in the road. None of them had\nanything to say.\nGlokta cleared his throat. 'Well, duty calls,' he bowed stiffly, 'but I hope\nto see you all again. Very soon.' Jezal found himself hoping he never saw\nthe man again.\n'Perhaps we might fence again sometime?' muttered Major West.\nGlokta gave a good natured laugh. 'Oh, I would enjoy that, West, but I\nfind that I'm ever so slightly crippled these days. If you're after a fight, I'm\nsure that Practical Frost could oblige you,' he looked over at Jalenhorm, 'but\nI must warn you, he doesn't fight like a gentleman. I wish you all a pleasant\nevening.' He placed his hat back on his head then turned slowly and\nshuffled off down the dingy street.\nThe three officers watched him limp away in an interminable, awkward\nsilence. Kaspa finally stumbled over. 'What was all that about?' he asked.\n'Nothing,' said West through gritted teeth. 'Best we forget it ever\nhappened.'\nTeeth and Fingers\n« ^ »\nTime is short. We must work quickly. Glokta nodded to Severard, and he\nsmiled and pulled the bag off Sepp dan Teufel's head.\nThe Master of the Mints was a strong, noble-looking man.

'Do you know who I am?'\nGlokta snorted. 'Of course we know who you are. Do you think we are\nin the habit of snatching people from the streets at random?'\n'I am the Master of the Royal Mints!' yelled the prisoner, struggling at\nhis bonds. Practical Frost looked on impassively, arms folded. The irons\nwere already glowing orange in the brazier. 'How dare you…'\n'We cannot have these constant interruptions!' shouted Glokta. Frost\nkicked Teufel savagely in the shin and he yelped with pain. 'How can our\nprisoner sign his paper of confession if his hands are tied? Please release\nhim.'\nTeufel stared suspiciously around as the albino untied his wrists. Then\nhe saw the cleaver. The polished blade shone mirror bright in the harsh\nlamp light. Truly a thing of beauty. You'd like to have that, wouldn't you,\nTeufel? I bet you'd like to cut my head off with it. Glokta almost hoped that\nhe would, his right hand seemed to be reaching for it, but he used it to\nshove the paper of confession away instead.\n'Ah,' said Glokta, 'the Master of the Mints is a right-handed gentleman.'\n'A right-handed gentleman,' Severard hissed in the prisoner's ear.\nTeufel was staring across the table through narrowed eyes. 'I know you!\nGlokta, isn't it? The one who was captured in Gurkhul, the one they\ntortured. Sand dan Glokta, am I right? Well, you're in over your head this\ntime, I can tell you! Right in over your head! When High Justice Marovia\nhears about this…'\nGlokta sprang to his feet, his chair screeching on the tiles. His left leg\nwas agony, but he ignored it. 'Look at this!' he hissed, then opened his\nmouth wide, giving the horrified prisoner a good look at his teeth. Or what's\nleft of them. 'You see that? You see? Where they cracked out the teeth\nabove, they left them below, and where they took them out below, they left\nthem above, all the way to the back. See?' Glokta pulled his cheeks back\nwith his fingers so Teufel could get a better view. 'They did it with a tiny\nchisel. A little bit each day. It took months.' Glokta sat down stiffly, then\nsmiled wide.\n'What excellent work, eh? The irony of it! To leave you half your teeth,\nbut not a one of 'em any use! I have soup most days.' The Master of the\nMints swallowed hard. Glokta could see a drop of sweat running down his\nneck. 'And the teeth were just the beginning. I have to piss sitting down like\na woman, you know. I'm thirty-five years old, and I need help getting out of\nbed.' He leaned back again and stretched out his leg with a wince. 'Every\nday is its own little hell for me. Every day. So tell me, can you seriously\nbelieve that anything you might say could scare me?'"

No longer half so sure of\nhimself. 'Confess,' he whispered. 'Then we can ship you off to Angland and\nstill get some sleep tonight.'\nTeufel's face had turned almost as pale as Practical Frost's, but he said\nnothing. The Arch Lector will be here soon. Already on his way, most likely.\nIf there is no confession when he arrives … we'll all be off to Angland. At\nbest. Glokta took hold of his cane and got to his feet. 'I like to think of\nmyself as an artist, but artistry takes time and we have wasted half the\nevening searching for you in every brothel in the city. Thankfully, Practical\nFrost has a keen nose and an excellent sense of direction. He can sniff out a\nrat in a shithouse.'\n'A rat in a shithouse,' echoed Severard, eyes glittering bright in the\norange glow from the brazier.\n'We are on a tight schedule so let me be blunt. You will confess to me\nwithin ten minutes.'\nTeufel snorted and folded his arms. 'Never.'\n'Hold him.' Frost seized the prisoner from behind and folded him in a\nvice-like grip, pinning his right arm to his side. Severard grabbed hold of\nhis left wrist and spread his fingers out on the scarred table-top. Glokta\ncurled his fist round the smooth grip of the cleaver, the blade scraping\nagainst the wood as he pulled it slowly towards him. He stared down at\nTeufel's hand. What beautiful fingernails he has. How long and glossy. You\ncannot work down a mine with nails like that. Glokta raised the cleaver\nhigh.\n'Wait!' screamed the prisoner.\nBang! The heavy blade bit deep into the table top, neatly paring off\nTeufel's middle fingernail. He was breathing fast now, and there was a\nsheen of sweat on his forehead. Now we'll see what kind of a man you really\nare.\n'I think you can see where this is going,' said Glokta. 'You know, they\ndid it to a corporal who was captured with me, one cut a day. He was a\ntough man, very tough. They made it past his elbow before he died.' Glokta\nlifted the cleaver again. 'Confess.'\n'You couldn't…'\nBang! The cleaver took off the very tip of Teufel's middle finger. Blood\nbubbled out on to the table top. Severard's eyes were smiling in the lamp\nlight. Teufel's jaw dropped. But the pain will be a while coming. 'Confess!'\nbellowed Glokta.\nBang! The cleaver took off the top of Teufel's ring finger, and a little\ndisc out of his middle finger which rolled a short way and dropped off onto\nthe floor. Frost's face was carved from marble. 'Confess!'\nBang! The tip of Teufel's index finger jumped in the air. His middle\nfinger was down to the first joint. Glokta paused, wiping the sweat from his\nforehead on the back of his hand. His leg was throbbing with the exertion."

That was the rumour. Such a one should have ways of\nfinding a man, even a man alone in the wide and barren North. If that was\nso, then he was taking his time about it.\nLogen scratched at his tangled beard and wondered what was keeping\nthe great one. Perhaps he was lost. He asked himself again if he should have\nstayed in the forests, where food at least was plentiful. But to the south the\nspirits had said, and if you went south from the hills you came to these\nwithered moors. So here he had waited in the briars and the mud, in bad\nweather, and mostly gone hungry.\nHis boots were worn out anyway, so he had set his miserable camp not\nfar from the road, the better to see this wizard coming. Since the wars, the\nNorth was full of dangerous scum—deserting warriors turned bandit,\npeasants fled from their burned-out land, leaderless and desperate men with\nnothing left to lose, and so on. Logen wasn't worried, though. No one had a\nreason to come to this arsehole of the world. No one but him and the\nMagus.\nSo he sat and waited, looked for food, didn't find any, sat and waited\nsome more. At this time of year the moors were often soaked by sudden\ndownpours, but he would have smoky, thorny little fires by night if he\ncould, to keep his flagging spirits up and attract any passing wizards. It had\nbeen raining this evening, but it had stopped a while before and it was dry\nenough for a fire. Now he had his pot over it, cooking a stew with the last of\nthe meat he had brought with him from the forest. He would have to move\non in the morning, and look for food. The Magus could catch up with him\nlater, if he still cared.\nHe was stirring his meagre meal, and wondering whether to go back\nnorth or move on south tomorrow, when he heard the sound of hooves on\nthe road. One horse, moving slowly. He sat back on his coat and waited.\nThere was a neigh, the jingle of a harness. A rider came over the rise.

A gaunt, pale,\nsickly-looking young man with dark rings round his eyes, long hair\nplastered to his head by the drizzle and a nervous smile. He seemed more\nwet than wise, and certainly didn't look powerful beyond the dreams of\nmen. He looked mostly hungry, cold, and ill. He looked something like\nLogen felt, in fact.\n'Shouldn't you have a staff?'\nThe young man looked surprised. 'I don't… that is to say… er… I'm not\na Magus.' He trailed off and licked his lips nervously.\n'The spirits told me to expect a Magus, but they're often wrong.'\n'Oh… well, I'm an apprentice.

'Oh good.' The apprentice\nbreathed a sigh of relief, then suddenly stopped himself. 'Oh, that is to\nsay… er… sorry about the finger.'\nLogen laughed. It was the first time since he dragged himself out of the\nriver. It wasn't very funny but he laughed loud. It felt good. The young man\nsmiled and slipped painfully from the saddle. 'I am Malacus Quai.'\n'Malacus what?'\n'Quai,' he said, making for the fire.\n'What kind of a name is that?'\n'I am from the Old Empire.'\nLogen had never heard of any such place.

'Well, Malacus Quai, you lost your food\nbut you kept hold of what really mattered. It takes an effort to make me\nsmile these days. You're right welcome at my fire.'\n'Thank you.' The apprentice paused and held his palms out to the\nmeagre flames. 'I haven't eaten for two days.' He shook his head, hair\nflapping back and forth. 'It has been… a difficult time.' He licked his lips\nand looked at the pot.\nLogen passed him the spoon. Malacus Quai stared at it with big round\neyes. 'Have you eaten?'\nLogen nodded. He hadn't, but the wretched apprentice looked famished\nand there was barely enough for one. He took another swig from the flask.\nThat would do for him, for now. Quai attacked the stew with relish. When it\nwas done he scraped the pot out, licked the spoon, then licked the edge of\nthe pot for good measure. He sat back against a big rock. 'I am forever in\nyour debt, Logen Ninefingers, you've saved my life. I hardly dared hope\nyou'd be so gracious a host.'\n'You're not quite what I expected either, being honest.' Logen pulled at\nthe flask again, and licked his lips. 'Who is this Bayaz?'\n'The First of the Magi, great in High Art and learned in deep wisdom. I\nfear he will be most seriously displeased with me.'\n'He's to be feared, then?'\n'Well,' replied the apprentice weakly, 'he does have a bit of a temper.'\nLogen took another swallow. The warmth was spreading through his\nbody now, the first time he had felt warm in weeks. There was a pause.\n'What does he want from me, Quai?'\nThere was no reply. The soft sound of snoring came from across the\nfire. Logen smiled and, wrapping himself in his coat, lay down to sleep as\nwell.\nThe apprentice woke with a sudden fit of coughing. It was early morning\nand the dingy world was thick with mist. It was probably better that way.\nThere was nothing to see but miles of mud, rock, and miserable brown\ngorse. Everything was coated in cold dew, but Logen had managed to get a\nsad tongue of fire going. Quai's hair was plastered to his pallid face. He\nrolled onto his side and coughed phlegm onto the ground.\n'Aaargh,' he croaked. He coughed and spat again.\nLogen secured the last of his meagre gear on the unhappy horse.\n'Morning,' he said, looking up at the white sky, 'though not a good one.'\n'I will die. I will die, and then I will not have to move.'\n'We've got no food, so if we stay here you will die. Then I can eat you\nand go back over the mountains.'\nThe apprentice smiled weakly. 'What do we do?'\nWhat indeed? 'Where do we find this Bayaz?'"

'Where do we find this Bayaz?'\n'At the Great Northern Library.'\nLogen had never heard of it, but then he'd never been that interested in\nbooks. 'Which is where?'\n'It's south of here, about four days' ride, beside a great lake.'\n'Do you know the way?'\nThe apprentice tottered to his feet and stood, swaying slightly, breathing\nfast and shallow. He was ghostly pale and his face had a sheen of sweat. 'I\nthink so,' he muttered, but he hardly looked certain.\nNeither Quai nor his horse would make four days without food, even\nproviding they didn't get lost. Food had to be the first thing. To follow the\nroad through the woods to the south was the best option, despite the greater\nrisk. They might get killed by bandits, but the forage would be better, and\nthe hunger would likely kill them otherwise.\n'You'd better ride,' said Logen.\n'I lost the horses, I should be the one to walk.'\nLogen put his hand on Quai's forehead. It was hot and clammy. 'You've\na fever. You'd better ride.'\nThe apprentice didn't try to argue. He looked down at Logen's ragged\nboots. 'Can you take my boots?'\nLogen shook his head. 'Too small.' He knelt down over the smouldering\nremains of the fire and pursed his lips.\n'What are you doing?'\n'Fires have spirits. I will keep this one under my tongue, and we can use\nit to light another fire later.' Quai looked too ill to be surprised. Logen\nsucked up the spirit, coughed on the smoke, shuddered at the bitter taste.\n'You ready to leave?'\nThe apprentice raised his arms in a hopeless gesture. 'I am packed.'\nMalacus Quai loved to talk. He talked as they made their way south across\nthe moors, as the sun climbed into the grimy skies, as they entered the\nwoods toward evening time. His illness did nothing to stop his chatter, but\nLogen didn't mind. It was a long time since anyone had talked to him, and it\nhelped to take his mind off his feet. He was starving and tired, but it was his\nfeet that were the problem. His boots were tatters of old leather, his toes cut\nand battered, his calf was still burning from the Shanka's teeth. Every step\nwas an ordeal. Once they had called him the most feared man in the North.\nNow he was afraid of the smallest sticks and stones in the road. There was a\njoke in there somewhere. He winced as his foot hit a pebble.\n'… so I spent seven years studying with Master Zacharus. He is great\namong the Magi, the fifth of Juvens' twelve apprentices, a great man.'\nEverything connected with the Magi seemed to be great in Quai's eyes. 'He\nfelt I was ready to come to the Great Northern Library and study with\nMaster Bayaz, to earn my staff. But things have not been easy for me here.\nMaster Bayaz is most demanding and…'\nThe horse stopped and snorted, shied and took a hesitant step back."

But things have not been easy for me here.\nMaster Bayaz is most demanding and…'\nThe horse stopped and snorted, shied and took a hesitant step back.\nLogen sniffed the air and frowned. There were men nearby, and badly\nwashed ones. He should have noticed it sooner but his attention had been on\nhis feet. Quai looked down at him. 'What is it?'\nAs if in answer a man stepped out from behind a tree perhaps ten strides\nahead, another a little further down the road. They were scum, without a\ndoubt. Dirty, bearded, dressed in ragged bits of mismatched fur and leather.\nNot, on the whole, unlike Logen. The skinny one on the left had a spear\nwith a barbed head. The big one on the right had a heavy sword speckled\nwith rust, and an old dented helmet with a spike on top. They moved\nforward, grinning. There was a sound behind and Logen looked over his\nshoulder, his heart sinking. A third man, with a big boil on his face, was\nmaking his way cautiously down the road toward them, a heavy wood axe\nin his hands.\nQuai leaned down from his saddle, eyes wide with fear. 'Are they\nbandits?'\n'You're the fucking seer,' hissed Logen through gritted teeth.\nThey stopped a stride or two in front. The one with the helmet seemed\nto be in charge. 'Nice horse,' he growled. 'Would you lend it to us?' The one\nwith the spear grinned as he took hold of the bridle.\nThings had taken a turn for the worse alright. A moment ago that had\nhardly seemed possible, but fate had found a way. Logen doubted that Quai\nwould be much use in a fight. That left him alone against three or more, and\nwith only a knife. If he did nothing him and Malacus would end up robbed,\nand more than likely killed. You have to be realistic about these things.\nHe looked the three bandits over again. They didn't expect a fight, not\nfrom two unarmed men—the spear was sideways on, the sword pointed at\nthe ground. He didn't know about the axe, so he'd have to trust to luck with\nthat one. It's a sorry fact that the man who strikes first usually strikes last, so\nLogen turned to the one with the helmet and spat the spirit in his face.\nIt ignited in the air and pounced on him hungrily. His head burst into\nspitting flames, the sword clattered to the ground. He clawed desperately at\nhis face and his arms caught fire as well. He reeled screaming away.\nQuai's horse startled at the flames and reared up, snorting. The skinny\nman stumbled back with a gasp and Logen leaped at him, grabbed the shaft\nof the spear with one hand and butted him in the face. His nose crunched\nagainst Logen's forehead and he staggered away with blood streaming down\nhis chin. Logen jerked him back with the spear, swung his right arm round\nin a wide arc and punched him in the neck. He went down with a gurgle and\nLogen tore the spear from his hands.\nHe felt movement behind him and dropped to the ground, rolling away"

He went down with a gurgle and\nLogen tore the spear from his hands.\nHe felt movement behind him and dropped to the ground, rolling away\nto his left. The axe whistled through the air above his head and cut a long\nslash in the horse's side, spattering drops of blood across the ground and\nripping the buckle on the saddle girth open. Boil-face tottered away,\nspinning around after his axe. Logen sprang at him but his ankle twisted on\na stone and he tottered like a drunkard, yelping at the pain. An arrow\nhummed past his face from somewhere in the trees behind and was lost in\nthe bushes on the other side of the road. The horse snorted and kicked, eyes\nrolling madly, then took off down the road at a crazy gallop. Malacus Quai\nwailed as the saddle slid off its back and he was flung into the bushes.\nThere was no time to think about him. Logen charged at the axe-man\nwith a roar, aiming the spear at his heart. He brought his axe up in time to\nnudge the point away, but not far enough. The spear spitted him through the\nshoulder, spun him round. There was a sharp crack as the shaft snapped,\nLogen lost his balance and pitched forward, bearing Boil-face down into the\nroad. The spear-point sticking out of his back cut a deep gash into Logen's\nscalp as he fell on top of him. Logen seized hold of the axe-man's matted\nhair with both hands, pulled his head back and mashed his face into a rock.\nHe lurched to his feet, head spinning, wiping blood out of his eyes just\nin time to see an arrow zip out of the trees and thud into a trunk a stride or\ntwo away. Logen hurtled at the archer. He saw him now, a boy no more than\nfourteen, reaching for another arrow. Logen pulled out his knife. The boy\nwas nocking the arrow to his bow, but his eyes were wide with panic. He\nfumbled the string and drove the arrow through his hand, looking greatly\nsurprised.\nLogen was on him. The boy swung the bow at him but he ducked below\nit and jumped forward, driving the knife up with both hands. The blade\ncaught the boy under the chin and lifted him into the air, then snapped off in\nhis neck. He dropped on top of Logen, the jagged shard of the knife cutting\na long gash in his arm. Blood splattered everywhere, from the cut on\nLogen's head, from the cut on Logen's arm, from the gaping wound in the\nboy's throat.\nHe shoved the corpse away, staggered against a tree and gasped for\nbreath. His heart was pounding, the blood roaring in his ears, his stomach\nturning over. 'I am still alive,' he whispered, 'I am still alive.' The cuts on his\nhead and his arm were starting to throb. Two more scars. It could have been\na lot worse. He scraped the blood from his eyes and limped back to the\nroad.\nMalacus Quai was standing, staring ashen-faced at the three corpses.\nLogen took him by the shoulders, looked him up and down. 'You hurt?'"

'Are they dead?' The corpse of the big\none with the helmet was still smoking, making a disgustingly appetising\nsmell. He had a good pair of boots on, Logen noticed, a lot better than his\nown. The one with the boil had his neck turned too far around to be alive,\nthat and he had the broken spear through him. Logen rolled the skinny one\nover with his foot. He still had a look of surprise on his bloody face, eyes\nstaring up at the sky, mouth open.\n'Must've crushed his windpipe,' muttered Logen. His hands were\ncovered in blood. He grabbed one with the other to stop them from\ntrembling.\n'What about the one in the trees?' Logen nodded. 'What happened to the\nhorse?'\n'Gone,' muttered Quai hopelessly. 'What do we do?'\n'We see if they've got any food.' Logen pointed to the smoking corpse.\n'And you help me get his boots off.'\nFencing Practice\n« ^ »\n'Press him, Jezal, press him! Don't be shy!'\nJezal was only too willing to oblige. He sprang forward, lunging with\nhis right. West was already off balance and he stumbled back, all out of\nform, only just managing to parry with his short steel. They were using\nhalf-edged blades today, to add a little danger to the proceedings. You\ncouldn't really stab a man with one, but you could give him a painful\nscratch or two, if you tried hard enough. Jezal intended to give the Major a\nscratch for yesterday's humiliation.\n'That's it, give him hell! Jab, jab, Captain! Jab, jab!'\nWest made a clumsy cut, but Jezal saw it coming and swatted the steel\naside, still pressing forward, jabbing for all he was worth. He slashed with\nthe left, and again. West blocked desperately, staggered back against the\nwall. Jezal had him at last. He cackled with glee as he lunged forward again\nwith the long steel, but his opponent had come suddenly and surprisingly\nalive. West slipped away, shoved the lunge aside with disappointing\nfirmness. Jezal stumbled forward, off balance, gave a shocked gasp as the\npoint of his sword found a gap between two stones and his steel was\nwrenched out of his numb hand, lodged there wobbling in the wall.\nWest darted forward, ducked inside Jezal's remaining blade and\nslammed into him with his shoulder. 'Ooof,' said Jezal as he staggered back\nand crashed to the floor, fumbling his short steel. It skittered across the\nstones and Lord Marshal Varuz caught it smartly under his foot. The\nblunted point of West's sword hovered over Jezal's throat.\n'Damn it!' he cursed, as the grinning Major offered him his hand.\n'Yes,' murmured Varuz with a deep sigh, 'damn it indeed.

'He never once lost control of that bout! You\nallowed yourself to be drawn in, and then disarmed! Disarmed! My\ngrandson would not have made that mistake, and he is eight years old!'\nVaruz whacked at the floor with his stick. 'Explain to me please, Captain\nLuthar, how you will win a fencing match from a prone position, and\nwithout your steels?'\nJezal sulked and rubbed the back of his head.\n'No? In future, if you fall off a cliff carrying your steels, I want to see\nyou smashed to bits at the bottom, gripping them tightly in your dead\nfingers, do you hear me?'\n'Yes, Marshal Varuz,' mumbled a sullen Jezal, wishing the old bastard\nwould take a tumble off a cliff himself. Or perhaps the Tower of Chains.\nThat would be adequate. Maybe Major West could join him.\n'Over-confidence is a curse to the swordsman! You must treat every\nopponent as though he will be your last. As for your footwork,' and Varuz\ncurled his lip with disgust, 'fine and fancy coming forward, but put you on\nthe back foot and you quite wither away. The Major only had to tap you and\nyou fell down like a fainting schoolgirl.'\nWest grinned across at him. He was loving this. Absolutely loving it,\ndamn him.\n'They say Bremer dan Gorst has a back leg like a pillar of steel. A pillar\nof steel they say! It would be easier to knock down the House of the Maker\nthan him.' The Lord Marshal pointed over at the outline of the huge tower,\nlooming up over the buildings of the courtyard. 'The House of the Maker!'\nhe shouted in disgust.\nJezal sniffed and kicked at the floor with his boot. For the hundredth\ntime he entertained the notion of giving it up and never holding a steel\nagain. But what would people say? His father was absurdly proud of him,\nalways boasting about his skill to anyone who would listen. He had his\nheart set on seeing his son fight in the Square of Marshals before a\nscreaming crowd. If Jezal threw it over now his father would be mortified,\nand he could say goodbye to his commission, goodbye to his allowance,\ngoodbye to his ambitions. No doubt his brothers would love that.\n'Balance is the key,' Varuz was spouting. 'Your strength rises up through\nthe legs! From now on we will add an hour on the beam to your training.\nEvery day.' Jezal winced. 'So: a run, exercises with the heavy bar, forms, an\nhour of sparring, forms again, an hour on the beam.' The Lord Marshal\nnodded with satisfaction. 'That will suffice, for now. I will see you at six\no'clock tomorrow morning, ice cold sober.' Varuz frowned. 'Ice. Cold.\nSober.'\n'I can't do this forever, you know,' said Jezal as he hobbled stiffly back\ntowards his quarters. 'How much of this horrible shit should a man have to\ntake?'"

'Worse than this?'\n'I didn't have the grounding that you've had. He made me hold the heavy\nbar over my head all afternoon until it fell on me.' The Major winced\nslightly, as though even the memory was painful. 'He made me run up and\ndown the Tower of Chains in full armour. He had me sparring four hours a\nday, every day.'\n'How did you put up with it?'\n'I didn't have a choice. I'm not a nobleman. Fencing was the only way\nfor me to get noticed. But it paid off in the end. How many commoners do\nyou know with a commission in the King's Own?'\nJezal shrugged. 'Come to think of it, very few.' As a nobleman himself,\nhe didn't think there should be any.\n'But you're from a good family, and a Captain already. If you can win\nthe Contest there's no telling how far you could go. Hoff—the Lord\nChamberlain, Marovia—the High Justice, Varuz himself for that matter,\nthey were all champions in their day. Champions with the right blood\nalways go on to great things.'\nJezal snorted. 'Like your friend Sand dan Glokta?'\nThe name dropped between them like a stone. 'Well… almost always.'\n'Major West!' came a rough voice from behind. A thickset sergeant with\na scar down his cheek was hurrying over to them. 'Sergeant Forest, how are\nyou?' asked West, clapping the soldier warmly on the back. He had a touch\nwith peasants, but then Jezal had to keep reminding himself that West was\nlittle better than a peasant himself. He might be educated, and an officer,\nand so forth, but he still had more in common with the sergeant than he did\nwith Jezal, once you thought about it.\nThe sergeant beamed. 'Very well, thank you, sir.' He nodded respectfully\nto Jezal. 'Morning, Captain.'\nJezal favoured him with a terse nod and turned away to look up the\navenue. He could think of no possible reason why an officer would want to\nbe familiar with the common soldiers. Furthermore, he was scarred and\nugly. Jezal had no use whatever for ugly people.\n'What can I do for you?' West was asking.\n'Marshal Burr wishes to see you, sir, for an urgent briefing. All senior\nofficers are ordered to attend.'\nWest's face clouded. 'I'll be there as soon as I can.' The sergeant saluted\nand strode off.\n'What's all that about?' asked Jezal carelessly, watching some clerk\nchase around after a paper he had dropped.\n'Angland. This King of the Northmen, Bethod.'

'They say he's defeated all his\nenemies in the North, and now he's spoiling for a fight with The Union.'\n'Well, if it's a fight he wants,' said Jezal airily. Wars were a fine thing, in\nhis opinion, an excellent opportunity for glory and advancement. The paper\nfluttered past his boot on the light breeze, closely followed by the puffing\nclerk. Jezal grinned at him as he hurried past, bent almost double in his\nclumsy efforts to try and grab it.\nThe Major snatched up the grubby document and handed it over. 'Thank\nyou, sir,' said the clerk, his sweaty face quite pitiful with gratitude, 'thank\nyou so much!'\n'Think nothing of it,' murmured West, and the clerk gave a sycophantic\nlittle bow and hurried away. Jezal was disappointed. He had been rather\nenjoying the chase. 'There could be war, but that's the least of my troubles\nright now.' West breathed a heavy sigh. 'My sister is in Adua.'\n'I didn't know you had a sister.'\n'Well I do, and she's here.'\n'So?' Jezal had little enthusiasm for hearing about the Major's sister.\nWest might have pulled himself up, but the rest of his family were distinctly\nbeneath Jezal's notice. He was interested in meeting poor, common girls he\ncould take advantage of, and rich, noble ones he might think about\nmarrying. Anything in between was of no importance.\n'Well, my sister can be charming but she is also a little…\nunconventional. She can be something of a handful in the wrong mood.\nTruth be told, I'd prefer to take care of a pack of Northmen than her.'\n'Come now, West,' said Jezal absently, hardly taking any notice of what\nhe was saying, 'I'm sure she can't be that difficult.'\nThe Major brightened. 'Well, I'm relieved to hear you say that. She's\nalways been keen to see the Agriont for herself, and I've been saying for\nyears that I'd give her a tour if she ever came here. We'd arranged it for\ntoday in fact.' Jezal had a sinking feeling. 'Now, with this meeting—'\n'But I have so little time these days!' whinged Jezal.\n'I promise I'll make it up to you. We'll meet you at my quarters in an\nhour.'\n'Hold on…' But West was already striding away.\nDon't let her be too ugly, Jezal was thinking as he slowly approached the\ndoor to Major West's quarters and raised his unwilling fist to knock. Just\ndon't let her be too ugly. And not too stupid either. Anything but an\nafternoon wasted on a stupid girl. His hand was halfway to the door when\nhe became aware of raised voices on the other side. He stood guiltily in the\ncorridor, his ear drawing closer and closer to the wood, hoping to hear\nsomething complimentary about himself.\n'… and what about your maid?' came Major West's muffled voice,\nsounding greatly annoyed.\n'I had to leave her at the house, there was a lot to do.

It could ruin his reputation.\n'But you can't just wander about the city on your own!'\n'I got here alright, didn't I? You're forgetting who we are, Collem. I can\nmake do without a servant. To most of the people here I'm no better than a\nservant anyway. Besides, I'll have your friend Captain Luthar to look after\nme.'\n'That's even worse, as you damn well know!'\n'Well I wasn't to know that you'd be busy. I would've thought you'd\nmake the time to see your own sister.' She didn't sound an idiot, which was\nsomething, but fat and now peevish too. 'Aren't I safe with your friend?'\n'He's a good enough sort, but is he safe with you?' Jezal wasn't sure\nwhat the Major meant by that little comment. 'And walking about the\nAgriont alone, and with a man you hardly know? Don't play the fool, I\nknow you better than that! What will people think?'\n'Shit on what they think.' Jezal jerked away from the door. He wasn't\nused to hearing ladies use that sort of language. Fat, peevish and coarse,\ndamn it. This might be even worse than he'd feared. He looked up the\ncorridor, considering making a run for it, already working out his excuse.\nCurse his bad luck, though, someone was coming up the stairs now. He\ncouldn't leave without being seen. He would just have to knock and get it\nover with. He gritted his teeth and pounded resentfully at the door.\nThe voices stopped suddenly, and Jezal put on an unconvincing friendly\ngrin. Let the torture begin. The door swung open.\nFor some reason, he had been expecting a kind of shorter, fatter version\nof Major West, in a dress. He had been greatly mistaken. She was perhaps\nslightly fuller of figure than was strictly fashionable, since skinny girls were\nall the rage, but you couldn't call her fat, not fat at all. She had dark hair,\ndark skin, a little darker than would generally be thought ideal. He knew\nthat a lady should remain out of the sun whenever possible, but looking at\nher, he really couldn't remember why. Her eyes were very dark, almost\nblack, and blue eyes were turning the heads this season, but hers shone in\nthe dim light of the doorway in a rather bewitching manner.\nShe smiled at him. A strange sort of smile, higher on one side than the\nother. It gave him a slightly uneasy feeling, as though she knew something\nfunny that he didn't. Still, excellent teeth, all white and shiny. Jezal's anger\nwas swiftly vanishing. The longer he looked at her the more her looks grew\non him, and the emptier his head became of cogent thought.\n'Hello,' she said."

It would hardly do to say he had been\nentirely unaware of her existence until that morning. He struggled to frame\neven a mildly amusing reply, but nothing came to mind.\nArdee took hold of him by the elbow and drew him into the room,\ntalking all the while. 'I know you're a great fencer, but I've been told your\nwit is even sharper than your sword. So much so in fact, that you only use\nyour sword upon your friends, as your wit is far too deadly.' She looked at\nhim expectantly. Silence.\n'Well,' he mumbled, 'I do fence a bit.' Pathetic. Utterly awful.\n'Is this the right man, or do I have the gardener here?' She looked him\nover with a strange expression, hard to read. Perhaps it was the same sort of\nlook Jezal would have while examining a horse he was thinking of buying:\ncautious, searching, intent, and ever so slightly disdainful. 'Even the\ngardeners have splendid uniforms, it seems.'\nJezal was almost sure that had been some kind of insult, but he was too\nbusy trying to think of something witty to pay it too much mind. He knew\nhe would have to speak now or spend the entire day in embarrassed silence,\nso he opened his mouth and trusted to luck. 'I'm sorry if I seem\ndumbfounded, but Major West is such an unattractive man. How could I\nhave expected so beautiful a sister?'\nWest snorted with laughter. His sister raised an eyebrow, and counted\nthe points off on her fingers. 'Mildly offensive to my brother, which is good.\nSomewhat amusing, which is also good. Honest, which is refreshing, and\nwildly complimentary to me, which, of course, is excellent. A little late, but\non the whole worth waiting for.' She looked Jezal in the eye. 'The afternoon\nmight not be a total loss.'\nJezal wasn't sure he liked that last comment, and he wasn't sure he liked\nthe way she looked at him, but he was enjoying looking at her, so he was\nprepared to forgive a lot. The women of his acquaintance rarely said\nanything clever, especially the fine-looking ones. He supposed they were\ntrained to smile and nod and listen while the men did the talking. On the\nwhole he agreed with that way of doing things, but the cleverness sat well\non West's sister, and she had more than caught his curiosity. Fat and peevish\nwere off the menu, of that there could be no doubt. As for coarse, well,\nhandsome people are never coarse, are they? Just… unconventional. He"

He\nwas beginning to think that the afternoon, as she had said, might not be a\ntotal loss.\nWest made for the door. 'It seems I must leave you two to make fools of\none another. Lord Marshal Burr is expecting me. Don't do anything I\nwouldn't, eh?' The comment seemed to be aimed at Jezal, but West was\nlooking at his sister.\n'That would seem to allow virtually everything,' she said, catching\nJezal's eye. He was amazed to feel himself blushing like a little girl, and he\ncoughed and looked down at his shoes.\nWest rolled his eyes. 'Mercy,' he said, as the door clicked shut.\n'Would you care for a drink?' Ardee asked, already pouring wine into a\nglass. Alone with a beautiful young woman. Hardly a new experience, Jezal\ntold himself, and yet he seemed to be lacking his usual confidence.\n'Yes, thank you, most kind.' Yes, a drink, a drink, just the thing to steady\nthe nerves. She held the glass out to him and poured another for herself. He\nwondered if a young lady should be drinking at this time of day, but it\nseemed pointless to say anything. She wasn't his sister, after all.\n'Tell me, Captain, how do you know my brother?'\n'Well, he's my commanding officer, and we fence together.' His brain\nwas beginning to function again. 'But then… you know that already.'\nShe grinned at him. 'Of course, but my governess always maintained\nthat young men should be allowed their share of the conversation.'\nJezal gave an ungainly cough as he was swallowing and spilled some\nwine down his jacket. 'Oh dear,' he said.\n'Here, take this a moment.' She gave him her glass and he took it\nwithout thinking, but then found himself without a free hand. When she\nstarted dabbing at his chest with a white handkerchief he could hardly\nobject, though it did seem rather forward. Being honest, he might have\nobjected if she wasn't so damn fine-looking. He wondered if she realised\nwhat an excellent view she was giving him down the front of her dress, but\nof course not, how could she? She was simply new here, unused to courtly\nmanners, the artless ways of a country girl and so forth… nice view though,\nthere was no denying that.\n'There, that's better,' she said, though the dabbing had made no apparent\ndifference. Not to his uniform anyway. She took the glasses from him,\ndrained her own quickly with a practised flick of her head and shoved them\non the table. 'Shall we go?'\n'Yes… of course. Oh,' and he offered her his arm.\nShe led him out into the corridor and down the stairs, chatting freely. It\nwas a flurry of conversational blows and, as Marshal Varuz had pointed out\nearlier, his defence was weak. He parried desperately as they made their\nway across the wide Square of Marshals, but he could barely get a word in.\nIt seemed as though it was Ardee who had been living there for years and\nJezal who was the bumpkin from the provinces."

She nodded over at the looming\nwall that separated the headquarters of the Union's armies from the rest of\nthe Agriont.\n'Indeed they are. That is where the Lord Marshals have their offices, and\nso forth. And there are barracks there, and armouries, and, er…' He trailed\noff. He could not think of much else to say, but Ardee came to his rescue.\n'So my brother must be somewhere in there. He's quite the famous\nsoldier, I suppose. First through the breach at Ulrioch, and so on.'\n'Well, yes, Major West is very well respected here…'\n'He can be such a bore, though, can't he? He does so love to be\nmysterious and troubled.' She put on a faint, faraway smile and rubbed her\nchin thoughtfully, just as her brother might have done. She had captured the\nman perfectly, and Jezal had to laugh, but he was starting to wonder if she\nshould be walking quite so close beside him, holding his arm in quite so\nintimate a way. Not that he objected of course. Quite the reverse, but people\nwere looking.\n'Ardee—' he said.\n'So this must be the Kingsway.'\n'Er, yes, Ardee—'\nShe was gazing up at the magnificent statue of Harod the Great, his\nstern eyes fixed on the middle distance. 'Harod the Great?' she asked.\n'Er, yes. In the dark ages, before there was a Union, he fought to bring\nthe Three Kingdoms together. He was the first High King.' You idiot,\nthought Jezal, she knows that already, everyone does. 'Ardee, I think your\nbrother would not—'\n'And this is Bayaz, the First of the Magi?'\n'Yes, he was Harod's most trusted adviser. Ardee—'\n'Is it true they still keep a vacant seat for him in the Closed Council?'\nJezal was taken aback. 'I'd heard that there's an empty chair there, but I\ndidn't know that—'\n'They all look so serious, don't they?'\n'Er… I suppose those were serious times,' he said, grinning lamely.\nA Knight Herald thundered down the avenue on a huge, well-lathered\nhorse, the sun glinting on the golden wings of his helmet. Secretaries\nscattered to let him pass, and Jezal tried to guide Ardee gently out of the\nway. To his great dismay she refused to be moved. The horse flashed past\nwithin a few inches of her, close enough for the wind to flick her hair in\nJezal's face. She turned to him with a flush of excitement on her cheek,\notherwise utterly undaunted by her brush with severe injury.\n'A Knight Herald?' she asked, taking Jezal's arm once again and leading\nhim off down the Kingsway.\n'Yes,' squeaked Jezal, desperately trying to bring his voice under\ncontrol, 'the Knights Herald are entrusted with a grave responsibility.

They\ncarry messages from the King to every part of the Union.' His heart had\nstopped hammering. 'Even across the Circle Sea to Angland, Dagoska, and\nWestport. They are entrusted to speak with the King's voice, and so\nforbidden from speaking except on the King's business.'\n'Fedor dan Haden was on the boat on our way over, he's a Knight\nHerald. We talked for hours.' Jezal attempted unsuccessfully to contain his\nsurprise. 'We talked about Adua, about the Union, about his family. Your\nname was mentioned, actually.' Jezal failed to look nonchalant once again.\n'In connection with the coming Contest.' Ardee leaned even closer to him.\n'Fedor was of the opinion that Bremer dan Gorst will cut you to pieces.'\nJezal gave a strangled cough, but he rallied well. 'Unfortunately, that\nopinion seems widely held.'\n'But not by you, I trust?'\n'Er…'\nShe stopped and took him by the hand, staring earnestly into his eyes.\n'I'm sure that you'll get the better of him, no matter what they say. My\nbrother speaks very highly of you, and he's stingy with his praise.'\n'Er…' mumbled Jezal. His fingers were tingling pleasantly. Her eyes\nwere big and dark, and he found himself greatly at a loss for words. She had\nthis way of biting on her lower lip that made his thoughts stray. A fine, full\nlip. He wouldn't have minded having a little chew on it himself. 'Well, thank\nyou.' He gave a gormless grin.\n'So this is the park,' said Ardee, turning away from him to admire the\ngreenery. 'It's even more beautiful than I'd imagined.'\n'Erm… yes.'\n'How wonderful, to be at the heart of things. I've spent so much of my\nlife on the edge. There must be many important decisions made here, many\nimportant people.' Ardee allowed her hand to trail through the fronds of a\nwillow tree by the road. 'Collem's worried there might be war in the North.\nHe was worried for my safety. I think that's why he wanted me to come\nhere. I think he worries too much. What do you think, Captain Luthar?'\nHe had been in blissful ignorance of the political situation until a couple\nof hours before, but that would never do as a reply. 'Well,' he said, straining\nto remember the name, and then with relief, 'this Bethod could do with a rap\non the knuckles.'\n'They say he has twenty thousand Northmen under his banner.' She\nleaned towards him. 'Barbarians,' she murmured. 'Savages,' she whispered.\n'I heard he skins his captives alive.'\nJezal thought this was hardly suitable conversation for a young lady.\n'Ardee…' he began.\n'But I'm sure with men like you and my brother to protect us, we\nwomenfolk have nothing to worry about.' And she turned and made off up\nthe path. Jezal had to hurry once again to catch up."

Jezal had to hurry once again to catch up.\n'And is that the House of the Maker?' Ardee nodded towards the grim\noutline of the huge tower.\n'Why, yes it is.'\n'Does no one go inside?'\n'No one. Not in my lifetime anyway. The bridge is kept behind lock and\nkey.' He frowned up at the tower. Seemed strange now, that he never\nthought about it. Living in the Agriont, it was always there. You just got\nused to it somehow. 'The place is sealed, I believe.'\n'Sealed?' Ardee moved very close to him. Jezal glanced around\nnervously but nobody was looking. 'Isn't it strange that nobody goes in\nthere? Isn't it a mystery?' He could almost feel her breath on his neck, 'I\nmean to say, why not just break the door down?'\nJezal was finding it horribly difficult to concentrate with her so close.\nHe wondered for a moment, both frightening and exciting, whether she\nmight be flirting with him? No, no, of course not! Just not used to the city\nwas all. The artless ways of a country girl… but then she was very close. If\nonly she were a little less attractive or a little less confident. If only she\nwere a little less… West's sister.\nHe coughed and looked off down the path, hoping vainly for a\ndistraction. There were a few people moving along it, but no one that he\nrecognised, unless… Ardee's spell was suddenly broken, and Jezal felt his\nskin go cold. A hunched figure, overdressed on this sunny day, was limping\ntoward them, leaning heavily on a cane. He was bent over and wincing with\nevery step, the faster-moving travellers giving him a wide berth. Jezal tried\nto steer Ardee away before he saw them, but she resisted gracefully and\nmade a direct line for the shambling Inquisitor.\nHis head snapped up as they approached and his eyes glinted with\nrecognition. Jezal's heart sank. There was no avoiding him now.\n'Why, Captain Luthar,' said Glokta warmly, shuffling a little too close\nand shaking his hand, 'what a pleasure! I'm surprised that Varuz has let you\ngo so early in the day. He must be mellowing in his old age.'\n'The Lord Marshal is still most demanding,' snapped Jezal.\n'I hope my Practicals didn't inconvenience you the other night.' The\nInquisitor shook his head sadly. 'They have no manners. No manners at all.\nBut they are the very best at what they do! I swear, the King doesn't have\ntwo more valuable servants.'\n'I suppose we all serve the King in our own way.' There was a little\nmore hostility in Jezal's voice than he had intended.\nIf Glokta was offended he didn't show it. 'Quite so. I don't believe I\nknow your friend.'\n'No. This is—'\n'Actually, we've met,' said Ardee, much to Jezal's surprise, giving her\nhand to the Inquisitor. Ardee West.'"

He bent down stiffly to kiss the back of\nher hand. Jezal saw his mouth twist as he straightened up, but the toothless\ngrin soon returned. 'Collem West's sister! But you are so much changed.'\n'For the better, I hope,' she laughed. Jezal felt horribly uncomfortable.\n'Why—yes indeed,' said Glokta.\n'And you are changed also, Sand.' Ardee looked suddenly very sad. 'We\nwere all so worried in my family. We hoped and hoped for your safe return.'\nJezal saw a spasm run over Glokta's face. 'Then when we heard you were\nhurt… how are you?'\nThe Inquisitor glanced at Jezal, his eyes cold as a slow death. Jezal\nstared down at his boots, a lump of fear in his throat. He had no need to be\nscared of this cripple, did he? But somehow he wished he was still at\nfencing practice. Glokta stared at Ardee, his left eye twitching slightly, and\nshe looked back at him undaunted, her eyes full of quiet concern.\n'I am well. As well as can be expected.' His expression had turned very\nstrange. Jezal felt more uncomfortable than ever. 'Thank you for asking.\nTruly. Nobody ever does.'\nThere was an awkward silence. The Inquisitor stretched his neck\nsideways and there was a loud click. 'Ah!' he said, 'that's got it. It's been a\npleasure to see you again, both of you, but duty calls.' He treated them to\nanother revolting smile then hobbled off, his left foot scraping in the gravel.\nArdee frowned at his twisted back as he limped slowly away. 'It's so\nsad,' she said under her breath.\n'What?' mumbled Jezal. He was thinking about that big white bastard in\nthe street, those narrow pink eyes. The prisoner with the bag on his head.\nWe all serve the King in our own way. Quite so. He gave an involuntary\nshiver.\n'He and my brother used to be quite close. He came to stay with us one\nsummer. My family were so proud to have him it was embarrassing. He\nused to fence with my brother every day, and he always won. The way he\nmoved, it was something to see. Sand dan Glokta. He was the brightest star\nin the sky' She flashed her knowing half-smile again. 'And now I hear you\nare.'\n'Er…' said Jezal, not sure whether she was praising him or poking fun.\nHe could not escape the feeling that he had been out-fenced twice that day,\nonce by each sibling.\nHe rather fancied that the sister had given him the worse beating.\nThe Morning Ritual\n« ^ »\nIt was a bright summers day, and the park was filled to capacity with\ncolourful revellers.

He ignored most, favoured the more important ones with his\nbrilliant smile. The lucky few beamed back at him, delighted to be noticed.\n'I suppose we all serve the King in our own way,' whined Captain\nLuthar, reaching for his steel, but Glokta was far too quick for him. His\nblade flashed with lightning speed, catching the sneering idiot through the\nneck.\nBlood splattered across Ardee West's face. She clapped her hands in\ndelight, looking at Glokta with shining eyes.\nLuthar seemed surprised to be killed. 'Hah. Quite so,' said Glokta with a\nsmile. The Captain pitched over onto his face, blood pouring from his\npunctured throat. The crowd roared their appreciation and Glokta indulged\nthem with a deep, graceful bow. The cheering was redoubled.\n'Oh, Colonel, you shouldn't,' murmured Ardee as Glokta licked the\nblood from her cheek.\n'Shouldn't what?' he growled, tipping her back in his arms and kissing\nher fiercely. The crowd were in a frenzy. She gasped as he broke away,\nlooking up at him adoringly with those big dark eyes of hers, lips slightly\nparted.\n'The Arth Ector wanth you,' she said with a comely smile.\n'What?' The crowd had fallen silent, damn them, and his left side was\nturning numb.\nArdee touched him tenderly on the cheek. 'The Arth Ector!' she shouted.\nThere was a heavy knock at the door. Glokta's eyes flicked open. Where am\nI? Who am I?\nOh no.\nOh yes. He realised straight away he had been sleeping badly, his body\nwas twisted round under the blankets, his face pushed into the pillow. His\nwhole left side was dead.\nThe beating on the door came heavier than before. 'The Arth Ector!'\ncame Frost's tongueless bellow from the other side.\nPain shot through Glokta's neck as he tried to raise his head from the\npillow. Ah, there's nothing like the first spasm of the day to get the mind\nworking. 'Alright!' he croaked, 'give me a minute, damn it!'\nThe albino's heavy footsteps thudded away down the corridor. Glokta\nlay still for a moment, then cautiously moved his right arm, ever so slowly,\nbreath rasping with the effort, and tried to twist himself onto his back. He\nclenched his fist as the needling started in his left leg. If only the damn thing\nwould stay numb. But the pain was coming on fast now. He was also\nbecoming aware of an unpleasant smell. Damn it. I've shit myself again.\n'Barnam!' howled Glokta, then waited, panting, left side throbbing with\na vengeance. Where is the old idiot? 'Barnam!' he screamed at the top of his\nlungs.\n'Are you alright, sir?' came the servant's voice from beyond the door.\nAlright? Alright, you old fool? Just when do you think I was last\nalright?

'I think I can manage,'\nGlokta hissed, tongue pressed into his empty gums, arms trembling as he\nhauled himself out of the bed and onto the chair beside it.\nHis grotesque, toeless left leg twitched to itself, still beyond his control.\nHe glared down at it with a burning hatred. Fucking horrible thing.\nRevolting, useless lump of flesh. Why didn't they just cut you off? Why don't\nI still? But he knew why not. With his leg still on he could at least pretend\nto be half a man. He punched his withered thigh, then immediately regretted\nit. Stupid, stupid. The pain crept up his back, a little more intense than\nbefore, and growing with every second. Come now, come now, let's not\nfight. He started to rub gently at the wasted flesh. We are stuck with each\nother, so why torment me?\n'Can you get to the door, sir?' Glokta wrinkled his nose at the smell then\ntook hold of his cane and slowly, agonisingly, pushed himself to his feet. He\nhobbled across the room, almost slipping halfway there but righting himself\nwith a searing twinge. He turned the key in the lock, leaning against the\nwall for balance, and hauled the door open.\nBarnam was standing on the other side, his arms outstretched, ready to\ncatch him. The ignominy of it. To think that I, Sand dan Glokta, the greatest\nswordsman the Union has ever seen, must be carried to my bath by an old\nman so that I can wash my own shit off. They must be laughing loud now,\nall those fools I beat, if they still remember me. I'd be laughing too, if it\ndidn't hurt so much. But he let the weight off his left leg and put his arm\nround Barnam's shoulders without complaint. What's the use after all?\nMight as well make it easy for myself. As easy as it can be.\nGlokta took a deep breath. 'Go gently, the leg hasn't woken up yet.' They\nhopped and stumbled down the corridor, slightly too narrow for both of\nthem together. The bathroom seemed a mile away. Or more. I'd rather walk\na hundred miles as I used to be, than to the bathroom as I am. But that's my\nbad luck isn't it? You can't go back. Not ever.\nThe steam felt deliciously warm on Glokta's clammy skin. With Barnam\nholding him under the arms he slowly lifted his right leg and put it gingerly\ninto the water. Damn it, that's hot. The old servant helped him get the other\nleg in, then, taking him under the armpits, lowered him like a child, until he\nwas immersed up to his neck.\n'Ahhh.' Glokta cracked a toothless smile.

You have to love the\nsmall things, when you've nothing else.\nPractical Frost was waiting for him downstairs in the tiny dining room, his\nbulk wedged into a low chair against the wall. Glokta sagged into the other\nchair and caught a whiff from the steaming porridge bowl, wooden spoon\nsticking up at an angle without even touching the side. His stomach\nrumbled and his mouth began watering fiercely. All the symptoms, in fact, of\nextreme nausea.\n'Hurray!' shouted Glokta. 'Porridge again!' He looked over at the\nmotionless Practical. 'Porridge and honey, better than money, everything's\nfunny, with porridge and honey!'\nThe pink eyes did not blink.\n'It's a rhyme for children. My mother used to sing it to me. Never\nactually got me to eat this slop though. But now,' and he dug the spoon in, 'I\ncan't get enough of it.'\nFrost stared back at him.\n'Healthy,' said Glokta, forcing down a mouthful of sweet mush and\nspooning up another, 'delicious,' choking down some more, 'and here's the\nreal clincher,' he gagged slightly on the next swallow, 'no chewing required.'\nHe shoved the mostly full bowl away and tossed the spoon after it.\n'Mmmmm,' he hummed. 'A good breakfast makes for a good day, don't you\nfind?'\nIt was like staring at a whitewashed wall, but without all the emotion.\n'So the Arch Lector wants me again, does he?'\nThe albino nodded.\n'And what might our illustrious leader desire with the likes of us, do you\nthink?'\nA shrug.\n'Hmmm.' Glokta licked bits of porridge out of his empty gums. 'Does he\nseem in a good mood, do you know?'\nAnother shrug.\n'Come, come, Practical Frost, don't tell me everything at once, I can't\ntake it in.'\nSilence. Barnam entered the room and cleared away the bowl. 'Do you\nwant anything else, sir?'\n'Absolutely. A big half-raw slab of meat and a nice crunchy apple.' He\nlooked over at Practical Frost. 'I used to love apples when I was a child.'\nHow many times have I made that joke? Frost looked back impassively,\nthere was no laughter there. Glokta turned to Barnam, and the old man gave\na tired smile.\n'Oh well,' sighed Glokta. A man has to have hope doesn't he?'\n'Of course sir,' muttered the servant, heading for the door.\nDoes he?\nThe Arch Lector's office was on the top floor of the House of Questions,\nand it was a long way up.

Whenever he felt their eyes on him Glokta would limp along, smiling,\nhead held high. Whenever he felt himself alone he would pause and gasp,\nsweat and curse, and rub and slap the tenuous life back into his leg.\nWhy does it have to be so high? he asked himself as he shuffled up the\ndim halls and winding stairs of the labyrinthine building. By the time he\nreached the ante-chamber he was exhausted and blowing hard, left hand\nsore on the handle of his cane.\nThe Arch Lector's secretary examined him suspiciously from behind a\nbig dark desk that took up half the room. There were some chairs placed\nopposite for people to get nervous waiting in, and two huge Practicals\nflanked the great double doors to the office, so still and grim as to appear a\npart of the furniture.\n'Do you have an appointment?' demanded the secretary in a shrill voice.\nYou know who I am, you self-important little shit.\n'Of course,' snapped Glokta, 'do you think I limped all the way up here\nto admire your desk?'\nThe secretary looked down his nose at him. He was a pale, handsome\nyoung man with a mop of yellow hair. The puffed up fifth son of some minor\nnobleman with over-active loins, and he thinks he can patronise me? 'And\nyour name is?' he asked with a sneer.\nGlokta's patience was worn out by the climb. He smashed his cane\ndown on the top of the desk and the secretary near jumped out of his chair.\n'What are you? A fucking idiot? How many crippled Inquisitors do you\nhave here?'\n'Er…' said the secretary, mouth working nervously.\n'Er? Er? Is that a number? Speak up!'\n'Well I—'\n'I'm Glokta, you dolt! Inquisitor Glokta!'\n'Yes, sir, I—'\n'Get your fat arse out of that chair, fool! Don't keep me waiting!' The\nsecretary sprang up, hurried to the doors, pushed one open and stood aside\nrespectfully. 'That's better,' growled Glokta, shuffling after him. He looked\nup at the Practicals as he hobbled past. He was almost sure one of them had\na slight smile on his face.\nThe room had hardly changed since he was last there, six years before.\nIt was a cavernous, round space, domed ceiling carved with gargoyle faces,\nits one enormous window offering a spectacular view over the spires of the\nUniversity, a great section of the outer wall of the Agriont, and the looming\noutline of the House of the Maker beyond.\nThe chamber was mostly lined with shelves and cabinets, stacked high\nwith neatly ordered files and papers. A few dark portraits peered down from\nthe sparse white walls, including a huge one of the current King of the\nUnion as a young man, looking wise and stern.

There was a heavy round table in the centre\nof the room, its surface painted with a map of the Union in exquisite detail.\nEvery city in which there was a department of the Inquisition was marked\nwith a precious stone, and a tiny silver replica of Adua rose out of the table\nat its hub.\nThe Arch Lector was sitting in an ancient high chair at this table, deep\nin conversation with another man: a gaunt, balding, sour-faced old fellow in\ndark robes. Sult beamed up as Glokta shuffled towards them, the other\nman's expression hardly changed.\n'Why, Inquisitor Glokta, delighted you could join us. Do you know\nSurveyor General Halleck?'\n'I have not had the pleasure,' said Glokta. Not that it looks like much of a\npleasure, though. The old bureaucrat stood and shook Glokta's hand without\nenthusiasm.\n'And this is one of my Inquisitors, Sand dan Glokta.'\n'Yes indeed,' murmured Halleck. 'You used to be in the army, I believe. I\nsaw you fence once.'\nGlokta tapped his leg with his cane. 'That can't have been any time\nrecently.'\n'No.' There was a silence.\n'The Surveyor General is likely soon to receive a most significant\npromotion,' said Sult. 'To a chair on the Closed Council itself.' The Closed\nCouncil? Indeed? A most significant promotion.\nHalleck seemed less than delighted, however. 'I will consider it done\nwhen it is his Majesty's pleasure to invite me,' he snapped, 'and not before.'\nSult floated smoothly over this rocky ground. 'I am sure the Council\nfeels that you are the only candidate worth recommending, now that Sepp\ndan Teufel is no longer being considered.' Our old friend Teufel? No longer\nconsidered for what?\nHalleck frowned and shook his head. 'Teufel. I worked with the man for\nten years. I never liked him,' or anyone else, by the look of you, 'but I would\nnever have thought him a traitor.'\nSult shook his head sadly. 'We all feel it keenly, but here is his\nconfession in black and white.' He held up the folded paper with a doleful\nfrown. 'I fear the roots of corruption can run very deep. Who would know\nthat better than I, whose sorry task it is to weed the garden?'\n'Indeed, indeed,' muttered Halleck, nodding grimly. 'You deserve all of\nour thanks for that. You also, Inquisitor.'\n'Oh no, not I,' said Glokta humbly. The three men looked at each other\nin a sham of mutual respect.\nHalleck pushed back his chair. 'Well, taxes do not collect themselves. I\nmust return to my work.'\n'Enjoy your last few days in the job,' said Sult.

The secretary ushered him out and pulled the heavy\ndoor shut. There was silence. But I'm damned if I'll be the one to break it.\n'I expect you're wondering what this was all about, eh, Glokta?'\n'The thought had crossed my mind, your Eminence.'\n'I bet it had.' Sult swept from his chair and strode across to the window,\nhis white-gloved hands clasped behind his back. 'The world changes,\nGlokta, the world changes. The old order crumbles. Loyalty, duty, pride,\nhonour. Notions that have fallen far from fashion. What has replaced them?'\nHe glanced over his shoulder for a moment, and his lip curled. 'Greed.\nMerchants have become the new power in the land. Bankers, shopkeepers,\nsalesmen. Little men, with little minds and little ambitions. Men whose only\nloyalty is to themselves, whose only duty is to their own purses, whose only\npride is in swindling their betters, whose only honour is weighed out in\nsilver coin.' No need to ask where you stand on the merchant class.\nSult scowled out at the view, then turned back into the room. 'Now it\nseems anyone's son can get an education, and a business, and become rich.\nThe merchant guilds: the Mercers, the Spicers and their like, grow steadily\nin wealth and influence. Jumped-up, posturing commoners dictating to their\nnatural betters. Their fat and greedy fingers, fumbling at the strings of\npower. It is almost too much to stand.' He gave a shudder as he paced across\nthe floor.\n'I will speak honestly with you, Inquisitor.' The Arch Lector waved his\ngraceful hand as though his honesty were a priceless gift. 'The Union has\nnever seemed more powerful, has never controlled more land, but beneath\nthe façade we are weak. It is hardly a secret that the King has become\nentirely unable to make his own decisions. Crown Prince Ladisla is a fop,\nsurrounded by flatterers and fools, caring for nothing but gambling and\nclothes. Prince Raynault is far better fitted to rule, but he is the younger\nbrother. The Closed Council, whose task it should be to steer this leaking\nvessel, is packed with frauds and schemers. Some may be loyal, some are\ndefinitely not, each intent on pulling the King his own way.' How\nfrustrating, when I suppose they should all be pulling him in yours?\n'Meanwhile, the Union is beset with enemies, dangers outside our\nborders, and dangers within. Gurkhul has a new and vigorous Emperor,\nfitting his country for another war. The Northmen are up in arms as well,\nskulking on the borders of Angland. In the Open Council the noblemen\nclamour for ancient rights, while in the villages the peasants clamour for\nnew ones.' He gave a deep sigh. 'Yes, the old order crumbles, and no one\nhas the heart or the stomach to support it.'\nSult paused, staring up at one of the portraits: a hefty, bald man dressed"

Zoller, the greatest of all\nArch Lectors. Tireless champion of the Inquisition, hero to the torturer,\nscourge of the disloyal. He glared down balefully from the wall, as though\neven beyond death he could burn traitors with a glance.\n'Zoller,' growled Sult. 'Things were different in his day, I can tell you.\nNo whinging peasants then, no swindling merchants, no sulking noblemen.\nIf men forgot their place they were reminded with hot iron, and any carping\njudge who dared to whine about it was never heard from again. The\nInquisition was a noble institution, filled with the best and the brightest. To\nserve their King and to root out disloyalty were their only desires, and their\nonly rewards.' Oh, things were grand in the old days.\nThe Arch Lector slid back into his seat and leaned forward across the\ntable. 'Now we have become a place where third sons of impoverished\nnoblemen can line their pockets with bribes, or where near-criminal scum\ncan indulge a passion for torture. Our influence with the King has been\nsteadily eroded, our budgets have been steadily cut. Once we were feared\nand respected, Glokta, but now…' We're a miserable sham. Sult frowned,\n'Well, less so. Intrigues and treasons abound, and I fear that the Inquisition\nis no longer equal to its task. Too many of the Superiors can no longer be\ntrusted. They are no longer concerned with the interests of the King, or of\nthe state, or of anybody's interests beyond their own.' The Superiors? Not to\nbe trusted? I swoon with the shock. Sult's frown grew still deeper. 'And now\nFeekt is dead.'\nGlokta looked up. Now that is news. 'The Lord Chancellor?'\n'It will become public knowledge tomorrow morning. He died suddenly\na few nights ago, while you were busy with your friend Rews. There are\nstill some questions surrounding his death, but the man was nearly ninety.\nThe surprise is that he lasted this long. The golden Chancellor they called\nhim, the greatest politician of his day. Even now they are setting his\nlikeness in stone, for a statue on the Kingsway.' Sult snorted to himself. 'The\ngreatest gift that any of us can hope for.'\nThe Arch Lector's eyes narrowed to blue slits. 'If you have any childish\nnotions that the Union is controlled by its King, or by those prating blue-\nblood fools on the Open Council, you can let them wilt now. The Closed\nCouncil is where the power lies. More than ever since the King's illness.\nTwelve men, in twelve big, uncomfortable chairs, myself among them.\nTwelve men with very different ideas, and for twenty years, war and peace,\nFeekt held us in balance. He played off the Inquisition against the judges,\nthe bankers against the military. He was the axle on which the Kingdom\nturned, the foundation on which it rested, and his death has left a hole.

I have a\nfeeling that whining ass Marovia, that bleeding heart of a High Justice, that\nself-appointed champion of the common man, will be first in the queue. It is\na fluid, and a dangerous, situation.' The Arch Lector planted his fists firmly\non the table before him. 'We must ensure that the wrong people do not take\nadvantage of it.'\nGlokta nodded. I think I take your meaning, Arch Lector. We must\nensure that it is we who take advantage, and no one else.\n'It need hardly be said that the post of Lord Chancellor is one of the\nmost powerful in the realm. The gathering of taxes, the treasury, the King's\nmints, all come under his auspices. Money, Glokta, money. And money is\npower, I need hardly tell you. A new Chancellor will be appointed\ntomorrow. The foremost candidate was our erstwhile Master of the Mints,\nSepp dan Teufel.' I see. Something tells me he will no longer be under\nconsideration.\nSult's lip curled. 'Teufel was closely linked with the merchant guilds,\nand the Mercers in particular.' His sneer became a scowl. 'In addition to\nwhich he was an associate of High Justice Marovia. So, you see, he would\nhardly have made a suitable Lord Chancellor.' No indeed. Hardly suitable.\n'Surveyor General Halleck is a far better choice, in my opinion.'\nGlokta looked towards the door. 'Him? Lord Chancellor?'\nSult got up smiling and moved over to a cabinet against the wall. 'There\nreally is no one else. Everyone hates him, and he hates everyone, except\nme. Furthermore, he is a hard-nosed conservative, who despises the\nmerchant class and everything they stand for.' He opened the cabinet and\ntook out two glasses and an ornate decanter. 'If not exactly a friendly face\non the Council, he will at least be a sympathetic one, and damned hostile\ntoward everyone else. I can hardly think of a more suitable candidate.'\nGlokta nodded. 'He seems honest.' But not so honest that I'd trust him to\nput me in the bath. Would you, your Eminence?\n'Yes,' said Sult, 'he will be very valuable to us.' He poured out two\nglasses of rich red wine. 'And just as a bonus, I was able to arrange for a\nsympathetic new Master of the Mints as well. I hear that the Mercers are\nabsolutely biting their tongues off with fury. Marovia's none too happy\neither, the bastard.' Sult chuckled to himself. 'All good news, and we have\nyou to thank.' He held out one of the glasses.\nPoison? A slow death twitching and puking on the Arch Lectors lovely\nmosaic floor? Or just pitching onto my face on his table? But there was\nreally no option but to grasp the glass and take a hearty swig. The wine was\nunfamiliar but delicious. Probably from somewhere very beautiful and far\naway.

But the Arch Lector was drinking too, all smiles and good grace. So I\nsuppose I will last out the afternoon, after all.\n'Yes, we have made a good first step. These are dangerous times alright,\nand yet danger and opportunity often walk hand in hand.' Glokta felt a\nstrange sensation creeping up his back. Is that fear, or ambition, or both? 'I\nneed someone to help me put matters in order. Someone who does not fear\nthe Superiors, or the merchants, or even the Closed Council. Someone who\ncan be relied upon to act with subtlety, and discretion, and ruthlessness.\nSomeone whose loyalty to the Union is beyond question, but who has no\nfriends within the government.' Someone who's hated by everyone?\nSomeone to take the fall if things turn sour? Someone who will have few\nmourners at their funeral?\n'I have need of an Inquisitor Exempt, Glokta. Someone to operate\nbeyond the Superiors' control, but with my full authority. Someone\nanswerable only to me.' The Arch Lector raised an eyebrow, as though the\nthought had only just come to him. 'It strikes me that you are exceptionally\nwell suited to this task. What do you think?'\nI think the holder of such a post would have a great many enemies and\nonly one friend. Glokta peered up at the Arch Lector. And that friend might\nnot be so very reliable. I think the holder of such a post might not last long.\n'Could I have some time to consider it?'\n'No.'\nDanger and opportunity often walk hand in hand… 'Then I accept.'\n'Excellent. I do believe this is the start of a long and productive\nrelationship.' Sult smiled at him over the rim of his glass. 'You know,\nGlokta, of all the merchants grubbing away out there, it is the Mercers I\nfind the most unpalatable. It was largely through their influence that\nWestport entered the Union, and it was because of Westport's money that\nwe won the Gurkish war. The King rewarded them, of course, with priceless\ntrading rights, but ever since then their arrogance has been insufferable.\nAnyone would have thought they fought the battles themselves, for the airs\nthey have put on, and the liberties they have taken. The honourable Guild of\nMercers,' he sneered. 'It occurs to me, now that your friend Rews has given\nus the means to hook them in so deeply, it would be a shame to let them\nwriggle free.'\nGlokta was much surprised, though he thought he hid it well. To go\nfurther? Why? The Mercers wriggle free and they keep on paying, and that\nkeeps all kinds of people happy. As things are, they're scared and soft—\nwondering who Rews named, who might be next in the chair. If we go\nfurther they may be hurt, or finished entirely. Then they'll stop paying, and\na lot of people will be unhappy. Some of them in this very building. 'I can\neasily continue my investigations, your Eminence, if you would like me to.'\nGlokta took another sip. It really was an excellent wine."

        "text": "easily continue my investigations, your Eminence, if you would like me to.'\nGlokta took another sip. It really was an excellent wine.\n'We must be cautious. Cautious and very thorough. The Mercers' money\nflows like milk. They have many friends, even amongst the highest circles\nof the nobility. Brock, Heugen, Isher, and plenty more besides. Some of the\nvery greatest men in the land. They've all been known to suck at that tit, one\ntime or another, and babies will cry when their milk is snatched away.' A\ncruel grin flickered across Sult's face. 'But still, if children are to learn\ndiscipline, they must sometimes be made to weep… who did that worm\nRews name in his confession?'\nGlokta leaned forward painfully and slid Rews' paper of confession\ntoward him, unfolded it and scanned the list of names from bottom to top.\n'Sepp dan Teufel, we all know'\n'Oh, we know and love him, Inquisitor,' said Sult, beaming down, 'but I\nfeel we may safely cross him off the list. Who else?'\n'Well, let's see,' Glokta took a leisurely look back at the paper. 'There's\nHarod Polst, a Mercer.' A nobody.\nSult waved his hand impatiently. 'He's nobody'\n'Solimo Scandi, a Mercer from Westport.' Also nobody.\n'No, no, Glokta, we can do better than Solimo what's-his-name can't we?\nThese little Mercers are of no real interest. Pull up the root, and the leaves\ndie by themselves.'\n'Quite so, Arch Lector. We have Villem dan Robb, minor nobility, holds\na junior customs post.' Sult looked thoughtful, shook his head. 'Then there's\n—'\n'Wait! Villem dan Robb…' The Arch Lector snapped his fingers, 'His\nbrother Kiral is one of the Queen's gentlemen. He snubbed me at a social\ngathering.' Sult smiled. 'Yes, Villem dan Robb, bring him in.'\nAnd so we go deeper. 'I serve and obey, your Eminence. Is there\nanyone's name in particular that need be mentioned?' Glokta set down his\nempty glass.\n'No.' The Arch Lector turned away and waved his hand again. 'Any of\n'em, all of 'em.

He knelt by the lake, pulled\nthe stopper from his flask and pushed it under the surface, watched the\nbubbles break as it filled up.\nMalacus Quai stumbled out of the bushes, breathing fast and shallow.\nHe sank down to his knees, crawled against the roots of a tree, coughed out\nphlegm onto the pebbles. His coughing sounded bad now. It came right up\nfrom his guts and made his whole rib cage rattle. He was even paler than he\nhad been when they first met, and a lot thinner. Logen was somewhat\nthinner too. These were lean times, all in all. He walked over to the haggard\napprentice and squatted down.\n'Just give me a moment.' Quai closed his sunken eyes and tipped his\nhead back. 'Just a moment.' His mouth hung open, the tendons in his\nscrawny neck standing out. He looked like a corpse already.\n'Don't rest too long. You might never get up.'\nLogen held out the flask. Quai didn't even lift his arm to take it, so\nLogen put it against his lips and tipped it up a little. He took a wincing\nswallow, coughed, then his head dropped back against the tree like a stone.\n'Do you know where we are?' asked Logen.\nThe apprentice blinked out at the water as though he'd only just noticed\nit. 'This must be the north end of the lake… there should be a track.' His\nvoice had sunk to a whisper. 'At the southern end there's a road with two\nstones.' He gave a sudden violent cough, swallowed with difficulty. 'Follow\nthe road over the bridge and you're there,' he croaked.\nLogen looked off along the beach at the dripping trees. 'How far is it?'\nNo answer. He took hold of the sick man's bony shoulder and shook it.\nQuai's eyelids flickered open, he stared up blearily, trying to focus. 'How\nfar?'\n'Forty miles.'\nLogen sucked his teeth. Quai wouldn't be walking forty miles. He'd be\nlucky to make forty strides on his own. He knew it well enough, you could\nsee it in his eyes. He'd be dead soon, Logen reckoned, a few days at the\nmost. He'd seen stronger men die of a fever.\nForty miles. Logen thought about it carefully, rubbing his chin with his\nthumb. Forty miles.\n'Shit,' he whispered.\nHe dragged the pack over and pulled it open. They had some food left,\nbut not much. A few shreds of tough dried meat, a heel of mouldy black\nbread. He looked out over the lake, so peaceful. They wouldn't be running\nout of drinking water any time soon at least. He pulled his heavy cookpot\nout of his pack and set it down on the shingle. They'd been together a long\ntime, but there was nothing left to cook. You can't become attached to\nthings, not out here in the wild. He tossed the rope away into the bushes,\nthen threw the lightened pack over his shoulder.\nQuai's eyes had closed again, and he was scarcely breathing. Logen still"

Logen still\nremembered the first time he had to leave someone behind, remembered it\nlike it was yesterday. Strange how the boy's name had gone but the face was\nwith him still.\nThe Shanka had taken a piece out of his thigh. A big piece. He'd moaned\nall the way, he couldn't walk. The wound was going bad, he was dying\nanyway. They had to leave him. No one had blamed Logen for it. The boy\nhad been too young, he should never have gone. Bad luck was all, could\nhappen to anyone. He'd cried after them as they made their way down the\nhillside in a grim, silent group, heads down. Logen seemed to hear the cries\neven when they'd left him far behind. He could still hear them.\nIn the wars it had been different. Men dropped from the columns all the\ntime on the long marches, in the cold months. First they fell to the back,\nthen they fell behind, then they fell over. The cold, the sick, the wounded.\nLogen shivered and hunched his shoulders. At first he'd tried to help them.\nThen he became grateful he wasn't one of them. Then he stepped over the\ncorpses and hardly noticed them. You learn to tell when someone isn't\ngetting up again. He looked at Malacus Quai. One more death in the wild\nwas nothing to remark upon. You have to be realistic, after all.\nThe apprentice started from his fitful sleep and tried to push himself up.\nHis hands were shaking bad. He looked up at Logen, eyes glittering bright.\n'I can't get up,' he croaked.\n'I know. I'm surprised you made it this far.' It didn't matter so much now.\nLogen knew the way. If he could find that track he might make twenty\nmiles a day.\n'If you leave me some of the food… perhaps… after you get to the\nlibrary… someone…'\n'No,' said Logen, setting his jaw. 'I need the food.'\nQuai made a strange sound, somewhere between a cough and a sob.\nLogen leaned down and set his right shoulder in Quai's stomach, pushed\nhis arm under his back. 'I can't carry you forty miles without it,' and he\nstraightened up, hauling the apprentice over his shoulder. He set off down\nthe shore, holding Quai in place by his jacket, his boots crunching into the\nwet shingle. The apprentice didn't even move, just hung there like a sack of\nwet rags, his limp arms knocking against the backs of Logen's legs.\nWhen he'd made it thirty strides or so Logen turned around and looked\nback. The pot was sitting forlorn by the lake, already filling up with\nrainwater. They'd been through a lot together, him and that pot.\n'Fare you well, old friend.'\nThe pot did not reply.\nLogen set his shivering burden gently down at the side of the road and\nstretched his aching back, scratched at the dirty bandage on his arm, took a\ndrink of water from his flask.

Water was the only thing to have passed his\nsore lips that day, and the hunger was gnawing at his guts. At least it had\nstopped raining. You have to learn to love the small things in life, like dry\nboots. You have to love the small things, when you've nothing else.\nLogen spat in the dirt and rubbed the life back into his fingers. There\nwas no missing the place, that was sure. The two stones towered over the\nroad, ancient and pitted, patched with green moss at the base and grey\nlichen higher up. They were covered in faded carvings, lines of letters in a\nscript Logen couldn't understand, didn't even recognise. There was a\nforbidding feel about them though, a sense more of warning than welcome.\n'The First Law…'\n'What?' said Logen, surprised. Quai had been in an unpleasant place\nbetween sleep and waking ever since they left the pot behind two days\nbefore. The pot could have made more meaningful sounds in that time. That\nmorning Logen had woken to find him scarcely breathing. He'd been sure\nthat he was dead, to begin with, but the man was still clinging weakly to\nlife. He didn't give up easy, you had to give him that.\nLogen knelt down and shoved the wet hair out of Quai's face. The\napprentice suddenly grabbed his wrist and started forward.\n'It's forbidden,' he whispered, staring at Logen with wide eyes, 'to touch\nthe Other Side!'\n'Eh?'\n'To speak with devils,' he croaked, grabbing hold of Logen's battered\ncoat. 'The creatures of the world below are made of lies! You mustn't do it!'\n'I won't,' muttered Logen, wondering if he'd ever know what the\napprentice was talking about. 'I won't. For what.that's worth.'\nIt wasn't worth much. Quai had already dropped back into his twitching\nhalf-sleep. Logen chewed at his lip. He hoped the apprentice would wake\nagain, but he didn't think it likely. Still, perhaps this Bayaz would be able to\ndo something, he was the First of the Magi after all, great in high wisdom\nand so on. So Logen hefted Quai up onto his shoulder again and trudged\nbetween the ancient stones.\nThe road climbed steep into the rocks above the lake, here built up,\nthere cut deep into the stony ground. It was worn and pitted with age,\npocked with weeds. It switched back on itself again and again, and soon\nLogen was panting and sweating, his legs burning with the effort. His pace\nbegan to slow.\nThe fact was, he was getting tired. Not just tired from the climb, or from\nthe back-breaking slog he'd walked that day with a half-dead apprentice\nover his shoulder, or from the slog the day before, or even from the fight in\nthe woods. He was tired of everything. Of the Shanka, of the wars, of his\nwhole life.\n'I can't walk for ever, Malacus, I can't fight for ever. How much of this\nhorrible shit should a man have to take?

In a\nproper fucking chair! Is that too much to ask? Is it?' In this frame of mind,\ncursing and grumbling at every step, and with Quai's head knocking against\nhis arse, Logen came to the bridge.\nIt was as ancient as the road, coated with creepers, simple and slender,\narching maybe twenty strides across a dizzying gorge. Far below a river\nsurged over jagged rocks, filling the air with noise and shining spray. On\nthe far side a high wall had been built between towering faces of mossy\nstone, made with such care it was difficult to say where the natural cliff\nended and the man-made one began. A single ancient door was set into it,\nfaced with beaten copper, turned streaky green by the wet and the years.\nAs Logen picked his way carefully across the slippery stone he found\nhimself wondering, through force of habit, how you could storm this place.\nYou couldn't. Not with a thousand picked men. There was only a narrow\nshelf of rock before the door, no room to set a ladder or swing a ram. The\nwall was ten strides high at least, and the gate had a dreadful solid look.\nAnd if the defenders were to bring down the bridge… Logen peered over\nthe edge, and swallowed. It was a long way down.\nHe took a deep breath and thumped on the damp green copper with his\nfist. Four big, booming knocks. He'd beat on the gates of Carleon like that,\nafter the battle, and its people had rushed to surrender. No one rushed to do\nanything now.\nHe waited. He knocked again. He waited. He became wetter and wetter\nin the mist from the river. He ground his teeth. He raised his arm to knock\nagain. A narrow hatch snapped open, and a pair of rheumy eyes stared at\nhim coldly from between thick bars.\n'Who's this now?' snapped a gruff voice.\n'Logen Ninefingers is my name. I've—'\n'Never heard of you.'\nHardly the welcome Logen had been hoping for. 'I've come to see\nBayaz.' No reply. 'The First of the—'\n'Yes. He's here.' But the door didn't open. 'He isn't taking visitors. I told\nthat to the last messenger.'\n'I'm no messenger, I have Malacus Quai with me.'\n'Malaca what?'\n'Quai, the apprentice.'\n'Apprentice?'\n'He's very ill,' said Logen slowly. 'He may die.'\n'Ill, you say? Die, was it?'\n'Yes.'\n'And what was your name again—'\n'Just open the fucking door!' Logen shook his fist pointlessly at the slot.\n'Please.'\n'We don't let just anyone in… hold up. Show me your hands.'\n'What?'\n'Your hands.' Logen held his hands up. The watery eyes moved slowly\nacross his fingers. 'There are nine. There's one missing, see?' He shoved the\nstump at the hatch.\n'Nine, is it? You should have said.'"

You should have said.'\nBolts clanked and the door creaked slowly open. An elderly man, bent\nunder an old-fashioned suit of armour, was staring at him suspiciously from\nthe other side. He was holding a long sword much too heavy for him. Its\npoint wobbled around wildly as he strained to keep it upright.\nLogen held up his hands. 'I surrender.'\nThe ancient gatekeeper was not amused. He grunted sourly as Logen\nstepped past him, then he wrestled the door shut and fumbled with the bolts,\nturned and trudged away without another word. Logen followed him up a\nnarrow valley lined with strange houses, weathered and mossy, half dug\ninto the steep rocks, merging with the mountainside.\nA dour-faced woman was working at a spinning wheel on a doorstep,\nand she frowned at Logen as he walked past with the unconscious\napprentice over his shoulder. Logen smiled back at her. She was no beauty,\nthat was sure, but it had been a very long time. The woman ducked into her\nhouse and kicked the door shut, leaving the wheel spinning. Logen sighed.\nThe old magic was still there.\nThe next house was a bakery with a squat, smoking chimney. The smell\nof baking bread made Logen's empty stomach rumble. Further on, a couple\nof dark-haired children were laughing and playing, running round a scrubby\nold tree. They reminded Logen of his own children. They didn't look\nanything like them, but he was in a morbid frame of mind.\nHe had to admit to being a little disappointed. He'd been expecting\nsomething cleverer-looking, and a lot more beards. These folk didn't seem\nso very wise. They looked just like any other peasants. Not unlike his own\nvillage had looked before the Shanka came. He wondered if he was in the\nright place. Then they rounded a bend in the road.\nThree great, tapering towers were built into the mountainside ahead,\njoined at their bases but separating higher up, covered in dark ivy. They\nseemed far older even than the ancient bridge and road, as old as the\nmountain itself. A jumbled mess of other buildings crowded around their\nfeet, straggling around the sides of a wide courtyard in which people were\nbusy with everyday chores. A thin woman was churning some milk on a\nstoop. A stocky blacksmith was trying to shoe a restless mare. An old, bald\nbutcher in a stained apron had finished chopping up some animal and was\nwashing his bloody forearms in a trough.\nAnd on a set of wide steps before the tallest of the three towers sat a\nmagnificent old man. He was dressed all in white, with a long beard, a hook\nnose, and white hair spilling from under a white skull-cap. Logen was\nimpressed, finally. The First of the Magi surely looked the part. As Logen\nshuffled towards him he started up from the steps and hurried over, white\ncoat flapping behind him.\n'Set him down here,' he muttered, indicating a patch of grass by the\nwell, and Logen knelt and dumped Quai on the ground, as gently as he"

The old man bent over him, laid a\ngnarled hand on his forehead.\n'I brought your apprentice back,' muttered Logen pointlessly.\n'Mine?'\n'Aren't you Bayaz?'\nThe old man laughed. 'Oh no, I am Wells, head servant here at the\nLibrary.'\n'I am Bayaz,' came a voice from behind. The butcher was walking\nslowly toward them, wiping his hands on a cloth. He looked maybe sixty\nbut heavily built, with a strong face, deeply lined, and a close-cropped grey\nbeard around his mouth. He was entirely bald, and the afternoon sun shone\nbrightly off his tanned pate. He was neither handsome nor majestic, but as\nhe came closer there did seem to be something about him. An assurance, an\nair of command. A man used to giving orders, and to being obeyed.\nThe First of the Magi took Logen's left hand in both of his and pressed\nit warmly. Then he turned it over and examined the stump of his missing\nfinger.\n'Logen Ninefingers, then. The one they call the Bloody-Nine. I have\nheard stories about you, even shut up here in my library.'\nLogen winced. He could guess what sort of stories the old man might\nhave heard. 'That was a long time ago.'\n'Of course. We all have a past, eh? I make no judgements on hearsay'\nAnd Bayaz smiled. A broad, white, beaming smile. His face lit up with\nfriendly creases, but a hardness lingered around his eyes, deep-set and\nglistening green. A stony hardness. Logen grinned back, but he reckoned\nalready that he wouldn't want to make an enemy of this man.\n'And you have brought our missing lamb back to the fold.' Bayaz\nfrowned down at Malacus Quai, motionless on the grass. 'How is he?'\n'I think he will live, sir,' said Wells, 'but we should get him out of the\ncold.'\nThe First of the Magi snapped his fingers and a sharp crack echoed from\nthe buildings. 'Help him.' The smith hurried forward and took Quai's feet,\nand together he and Wells carried the apprentice through the tall door into\nthe library.\n'Now, Master Ninefingers, I have called and you have answered, and\nthat shows good manners. Manners might be out of fashion in the North,\nbut I want you to know that I appreciate them. Courtesy should be answered\nwith courtesy, I have always thought. But what's this now?' The old\ngatekeeper was hurrying back across the yard, greatly out of breath. 'Two\nvisitors in one day? Whatever next?'\n'Master Bayaz!' wheezed the gatekeeper, 'there's riders at the gate, well\nhorsed and well armed! They say they've an urgent message from the King\nof the Northmen!'\nBethod.

He'd got away from their last meeting with his life and\nnothing else, and yet it was better than many had managed, far better.\n'Well, master?' asked the gatekeeper, 'shall I tell them to be off?'\n'Who leads them?'\n'A fancy lad with a sour face. Said he's this King's son or something.'\n'Was it Calder or Scale? They're both something sour.'\n'The younger one, I reckon.'\nCalder then, that was something. Either one was bad, but Scale was\nmuch the worse. Both together were an experience to be avoided. Bayaz\nseemed to consider a moment. 'Prince Calder may enter, but his men must\nremain beyond the bridge.'\n'Yes sir, beyond the bridge.' The gatekeeper wheezed away. He'd love\nthat, would Calder. Logen was greatly tickled by the thought of the so-\ncalled Prince screaming uselessly through that little slot.\n'The King of the Northmen now, can you imagine?' Bayaz stared\nabsently off down the valley. 'I knew Bethod when he was not so grand.\nAnd so did you, eh, Master Ninefingers?'\nLogen frowned. He'd known Bethod when he was next to nothing, a\nlittle chieftain like so many others. Logen had come for help against the\nShanka, and Bethod had given it, at a price. Back then, the price had\nseemed light, and well worth the paying. Just to fight. To kill a few men.\nLogen had always found killing easy, and Bethod had seemed a man well\nworth fighting for—bold, proud, ruthless, venomously ambitious. All\nqualities that Logen had admired, back then, all qualities he thought he had\nhimself. But time had changed them both, and the price had risen.\n'He used to be a better man,' Bayaz was musing, 'but crowns sit badly on\nsome people. Do you know his sons?'\n'Better than I'd like.'\nBayaz nodded. 'They're absolute shit, aren't they? And I fear now they\nwill never improve. Imagine that pin-head Scale a king. Ugh!' The wizard\nshuddered. 'It almost makes you want to wish his father a long life. Almost,\nbut not quite.'\nThe little girl that Logen had seen playing scurried over. She had a\nchain of yellow flowers in her hands, and she held it up to the old wizard. 'I\nmade this,' she said. Logen could hear the rapid pounding of hooves coming\nup the road.\n'For me? How perfectly charming.' Bayaz took the flowers from her.\n'Excellent work, my dear. The Master Maker himself could not have done\nbetter.'\nThe rider clattered out into the yard, pulled his horse up savagely and\nswung from the saddle. Calder. The years had been kinder to him than to\nLogen, that much was clear. He was dressed all in fine blacks trimmed with\ndark fur.

His jaw dropped.\nCalder took a shocked half step back and his hand twitched towards his\nsword. Then he smiled a cold little smile.\n'So you've taken to keeping dogs have you, Bayaz? I'd watch this one.\nHe's been known to bite his master's hand.' His lip curled further. 'I could\nput him down for you if you'd like.'\nLogen shrugged. Hard words are for fools and cowards. Calder might\nhave been both, but Logen was neither. If you mean to kill, you're better\ngetting right to it than talking about it. Talk only makes the other man ready,\nand that's the last thing you want. So Logen said nothing. Calder could take\nthat for weakness if he pleased, and so much the better. Fights might find\nLogen depressingly often, but he was long, long past looking for them.\nBethod's second son turned his contempt on the First of the Magi. 'My\nfather will be displeased, Bayaz! That my men must wait outside the gate\nshows little respect!'\n'But I have so little, Prince Calder,' said the wizard calmly. 'Please don't\nbe downhearted, though. Your last messenger wasn't allowed over the\nbridge, so you see we're making progress.'\nCalder scowled. 'Why have you not answered my father's summons?'\n'There are so many demands on my time.' Bayaz held up the chain of\nflowers. 'These don't make themselves, you know.'\nThe Prince was not amused. 'My father,' he boomed, 'Bethod, King of\nthe Northmen, commands you to attend upon him at Carleon!' He cleared\nhis throat. 'He will not…' He coughed.\n'What?' demanded Bayaz. 'Speak up, child!'\n'He commands…' The Prince coughed again, spluttered, choked. He put\na hand to his throat. The air seemed to have become very still.\n'Commands, does he?' Bayaz frowned. 'Bring great Juvens back from\nthe land of the dead. He may command me. He alone, and no other.' The\nfrown grew deeper still, and Logen had to resist a strange desire to back\naway. 'You may not. Nor may your father, whatever he calls himself.'\nCalder sank slowly to his knees, face twisted, eyes watering. Bayaz\nlooked him up and down. 'What solemn attire, did somebody die? Here,'\nand he tossed the chain of flowers over the Prince's head. 'A little colour\nmay lighten your mood. Tell your father he must come himself. I do not\nwaste my time on fools and younger sons. I am old fashioned in this. I like\nto talk to the horse's head, not the horse's arse. Do you understand me, boy?'\nCalder was sagging sideways, eyes red and bulging. The First of the Magi"

'You may go.'\nThe Prince heaved in a ragged breath, coughed and reeled to his feet,\nstumbled for his horse and hauled himself up into the saddle with a deal less\ngrace than he had got down. He shot a murderous glance over his shoulder\nas he made for the gate, but it didn't have quite the same weight with his\nface red as a slapped arse. Logen realised he was grinning, wide. It was a\nlong time since he'd enjoyed himself this much.\n'I understand that you can speak to the spirits.'\nLogen was caught off guard. 'Eh?'\n'To speak to the spirits.' Bayaz shook his head. 'It is a rare gift in these\ntimes. How are they?'\n'What, the spirits?'\n'Yes.'\n'Dwindling.'\n'Soon they will all sleep, eh? The magic leaks out of the world. That is\nthe set order of things. Over the years my knowledge has grown, and yet\nmy power has diminished.'\n'Calder seemed impressed.'\n'Bah.' Bayaz waved his hand. 'A mere nothing. A little trick of air and\nflesh, easily done. No, believe me, the magic ebbs away. It is a fact. A\nnatural law. Still, there are many ways to crack an egg, eh, my friend? If\none tool fails then we must try another.' Logen was no longer entirely sure\nwhat they were talking about, but he was too tired to ask.\n'Yes, indeed,' murmured the First of the Magi. 'There are many ways to\ncrack an egg. Speaking of which, you look hungry.'\nLogen's mouth flooded with spit at the very mention of food. 'Yes,' he\nmumbled. 'Yes… I could eat.'\n'Of course.' Bayaz clapped him warmly on the shoulder. 'And then\nperhaps a bath? Not that we are offended of course, but I find that there is\nnothing more soothing than hot water after a long walk, and you, I suspect,\nhave had a very long walk indeed.

Harlen Morrow, his Under-Secretary for Audiences, looked even\nmore uncomfortable, but then he had his terror of Hoff to contend with, in\naddition to the heat.

West\nfervently wished, and not for the first time that afternoon, that he was lying\nunder a tree in the park, with a strong drink. Or perhaps under a glacier,\nentombed within the ice. Anywhere but here.\nStanding guard on these horrible audiences was hardly one of West's\nmore pleasant duties, but it could have been worse. You had to spare a\nthought for the eight soldiers stood around the walls: they were in full\narmour. West was waiting for one of them to pass out and crash to the floor\nwith a sound like a cupboard full of saucepans, no doubt to the great disgust\nof the Lord Chamberlain, but so far they were all somehow staying upright.\n'Why is this damned room always the wrong temperature?' Hoff was\ndemanding to know, as if the heat was an insult directed solely at him. 'It's\ntoo hot half the year, too cold the other half! There's no air in here, no air at\nall! Why don't these windows open? Why can't we have a bigger room?'\n'Er…' mumbled the harassed Under-Secretary, pushing his spectacles up\nhis sweaty nose, 'requests for audiences have always been held here, my\nLord Chamberlain.' He paused under the fearsome gaze of his superior.\n'Er… it is… traditional?'\n'I know that, you dolt!' thundered Hoff, face crimson with heat and fury.\n'Who asked for your damn fool of an opinion anyway?'\n'Yes, that is to say, no,' stuttered Morrow, 'that is to say, quite so, my\nLord.'\nHoff shook his head with a mighty frown, staring around the room in\nsearch of something else to displease him. 'How many more must we\nendure today?'\n'Er… four more, your Grace.'\n'Damn it!' thundered the Chamberlain, shifting in his huge chair and\nflapping his fur-trimmed collar to let some air in. 'This is intolerable!' West\nfound himself in silent agreement. Hoff snatched up a silver goblet from the\ntable and took a great slurp of wine. He was a great one for drinking, indeed\nhe had been drinking all afternoon. It had not improved his temper. 'Who's\nthe next fool?' he demanded.\n'Er…' Morrow squinted at a large document through his spectacles,\ntracing across the crabby writing with an inky finger.

To underline the balance of power within the room, the Lord\nChamberlain's table was raised up on a high dais, so that even standing the\npoor man had to look up at them.

'And you come before us\nseeking an audience with his August Majesty, the High King of the Union?'\nGoodman Heath licked his lips. West wondered how far he had come to\nbe made a fool of. A very long way, most likely. 'My family have been put\noff our land. The landlord said we had not been paying the rent but—'\nThe Lord Chamberlain waved a hand. 'Plainly this is a matter for the\nCommission for Land and Agriculture.

His time is valuable, and so is mine. Good\nday.' And that was it. Two of the soldiers pulled the double doors open for\nGoodman Heath to leave.\nThe peasant's face had gone very pale, his knuckles wringing at the brim\nof his hat. 'Good my Lord,' he stammered, 'I've already been to the\nCommission…'\nHoff looked up sharply, making the farmer stammer to a halt. 'Good\nday, I said!'\nThe peasant's shoulders slumped. He took a last look around the room.\nMorrow was examining something on the far wall with great interest and\nrefused to meet his eye. The Lord Chamberlain stared back at him angrily,\ninfuriated by this unforgivable waste of his time. West felt sick to be a part\nof it. Heath turned and shuffled away, head bowed. The doors swung shut.\nHoff bashed his fist on the table. 'Did you see that?' He stared round\nfiercely at the sweating assembly. 'The sheer gall of the man! Did you see\nthat, Major West?'\n'Yes, my Lord Chamberlain, I saw it all,' said West stiffly. 'It was a\ndisgrace.'\nFortunately, Hoff did not take his whole meaning. 'A disgrace, Major\nWest, you are quite right! Why the hell is it that all the promising young\nmen go into the army? I want to know who is responsible for letting these\nbeggars in here!' He glared at the Under-Secretary, who swallowed and\nstared at his documents. 'What's next?'\n'Er,' mumbled Morrow, 'Coster dan Kault, Magister of the Guild of\nMercers.'\n'I know who he is, damn it!' snapped Hoff, wiping a fresh sheen of\nsweat from his face.

'Show the grubbing old swindler in, then!'\nMagister Kault could hardly have presented a more different appearance\nfrom the previous supplicant.

His purple vesture of office was embroidered with\nyards of golden thread, so ostentatious that the Emperor of Gurkhul himself\nmight have been embarrassed to wear it. He was accompanied by a pair of\nsenior Mercers, their own attire scarcely less magnificent. West wondered if\nGoodman Heath could earn enough in ten years to pay for one of those\ngowns. He decided not, even if he hadn't been thrown off his land.\n'My Lord Chamberlain,' intoned Kault with an elaborate bow. Hoff\nacknowledged the head of the Guild of Mercers as faintly as humanly\npossible, with a raised eyebrow and an almost imperceptible twist of the lip.\nKault waited for a greeting which he felt more befitting of his station, but\nnone was forthcoming.

It was already clear that\nthis interview would be every bit as unsuccessful as the last. There was a\nkind of horrible justice to it, West supposed. The great and the small were\ntreated exactly alike.\nMagister Kault's eyes narrowed slightly, but he continued. 'The\nhonourable Guild of Mercers, of whom I am the humble representative…'\nHoff slurped wine noisily and Kault was obliged to pause for a moment.

If you could have stabbed someone in the face with the\nphrase 'good day', the head of the Guild of Mercers would have lain dead on\nthe floor.\nKault blinked a couple of times, then turned angrily and strode out with\nas much dignity as he could muster. His two lackeys followed close on his\nheels, their fabulous gowns flapping behind them. The doors were pushed\nshut.\nHoff smashed the table once again with his fist. 'An outrage!' he\nspluttered. 'Those arrogant swine! Do they seriously think they can flout the\nKing's law and still seek the King's help when things turn sour?'\n'Well, no,' said Morrow, 'of course…'\nThe Lord Chamberlain ignored his Under-Secretary and turned to West\nwith a sneering smile. 'Still, I fancy I could see the vultures circling around\nthem, despite the low ceiling, eh, Major West?'\n'Indeed, my Lord Chamberlain,' mumbled West, thoroughly\nuncomfortable and wishing this torture would end. Then he could get back\nto his sister. His heart sank. She was even more of a handful than he\nremembered. She was clever alright, but he worried that she might be too\nclever for her own good. If only she would just marry some honest man and\nbe happy. His position here was precarious enough, without her making a\nspectacle of herself.\n'Vultures, vultures,' Hoff was murmuring to himself. 'Nasty-looking\nbirds, but they have their uses. What's next?'\nThe sweating Under-Secretary looked even more uncomfortable than\nbefore as he fumbled for the right words. 'We have a party of… diplomats?'\nThe Lord Chamberlain paused, goblet halfway to his mouth."

'We have a party of… diplomats?'\nThe Lord Chamberlain paused, goblet halfway to his mouth.\n'Diplomats? From whom?'\n'Er… from this so-called King of the Northmen, Bethod.'\nHoff burst out laughing. 'Diplomats?' he cackled, mopping his face on\nhis sleeve. 'Savages, you mean!'\nThe Under-Secretary chuckled unconvincingly. 'Ah yes, my Lord, ha,\nha! Savages, of course!'\n'But dangerous, eh, Morrow?' snapped the Lord Chamberlain, his good\nhumour evaporating instantly. The Under-Secretary's cackling gurgled to a\nhalt. 'Very dangerous. We must be careful. Show them in!'\nThere were four of them. The two smallest were great big, fierce-\nlooking men, scarred and bearded, clad in heavy battered armour. They had\nbeen disarmed at the gate of the Agriont, of course, but there was still a\nsense of danger about them, and West had the feeling they would have\ngiven up a lot of big, well-worn weapons. These were the sort of men who\nwere crowded on the borders of Angland, hungry for war, not far from\nWest's home.\nWith them came an older man, also in pitted armour, and with long hair\nand a great white beard. There was a livid scar across his face and through\nhis eye, which was blind white. He had a broad smile on his lips though,\nand his pleasant demeanour was greatly at odds with that of his two dour\ncompanions, and with the fourth man, who came behind.\nHe had to stoop to get under the lintel, which was a good seven feet\nabove the floor. He was swathed and hooded in a rough brown cloak,\nfeatures invisible. As he straightened up, towering over everyone else, the\nroom began to seem absurdly cramped. His sheer bulk was intimidating, but\nthere was something more, something that seemed to come off him in sickly\nwaves. The soldiers around the walls felt it, and they shifted uncomfortably.\nThe Under-Secretary for Audiences felt it, sweating and twitching and\nfussing with his documents. Major West certainly felt it. His skin had gone\ncold despite the heat, and he could feel every hair on his body standing up\nunder his damp uniform.\nOnly Hoff seemed unaffected. He looked the four Northmen up and\ndown with a deep frown on his face, no more impressed with the hooded\ngiant than he had been with Goodman Heath. 'So you are messengers from\nBethod.' He rolled the words around in his mouth, then spat them out, 'The\nKing of the Northmen.'\n'We are,' said the smiling old man, bowing with great reverence. 'I am\nWhite-Eye Hansul.' His voice was rich, round and pleasant, without any\naccent, not at all what West had been expecting.\n'And you are Bethod's emissary?' asked Hoff casually, taking another\nswallow of wine from his goblet. For the first time ever West was pleased\nthe Lord Chamberlain was in the room with him, but then he glanced up at\nthe hooded man and the feeling of unease returned."

For the first time ever West was pleased\nthe Lord Chamberlain was in the room with him, but then he glanced up at\nthe hooded man and the feeling of unease returned.\n'Oh no,' said White-Eye, 'I am here merely as translator. This is the\nemissary of the King of the Northmen,' and his good eye flicked nervously\nup to the dark figure in the cloak, as though even he was afraid. 'Fenris.' He\nstretched out the 's' on the end of the name so that it hissed in the air. 'Fenris\nthe Feared.'\nAn apt name indeed. Major West thought back to songs he had heard in\nhis childhood, stories of bloodthirsty giants in the mountains of the distant\nnorth. The room was silent for a moment.\n'Humph,' said the Lord Chamberlain, unmoved. 'And you seek an\naudience with his August Majesty, the High King of the Union?'\n'We do indeed, my Lord Chamberlain,' said the old warrior. 'Our master,\nBethod, greatly regrets the hostility between our two nations. He wishes\nonly to be on the best of terms with his southern neighbours. We bring an\noffer of peace from my King to yours, and a gift to show our good faith.\nNothing more.'\n'Well, well,' said Hoff, sitting back in his high chair with a broad smile.\n'A gracious request, graciously made. You may see the King in Open\nCouncil tomorrow, and present your offer, and your gift, before the\nforemost peers of the realm.'\nWhite-Eye bowed respectfully. 'You are most kind, my Lord\nChamberlain.' He turned for the door, followed by the two dour warriors.\nThe cloaked figure lingered for a moment, then he too slowly turned and\nstooped through the doorway. It wasn't until the doors were shut that West\ncould breathe easily again. He shook his head and shrugged his sweaty\nshoulders. Songs about giants indeed. A great big man in a cloak was all.\nBut looking again, that doorway really was very high…\n'There, you see, Master Morrow?' Hoff looked intensely pleased with\nhimself. 'Hardly the savages you led me to expect! I feel we are close to a\nresolution of our northern problems, don't you?'\nThe Under-Secretary did not look in the least convinced. 'Er… yes, my\nLord, of course.'\n'Yes indeed. A lot of fuss over nothing. A lot of pessimistic, defeatist\nnonsense from our jumpy citizens up north, eh? War? Bah!' Hoff whacked\nhis hand on the table again, making wine slop out of his goblet and spatter\non the wood. 'These Northmen wouldn't dare! Why, next thing you know\nthey'll be petitioning us for membership of the Union! You see if I'm not\nright, eh, Major West?'\n'Er…'\n'Good! Excellent! We've got something done today at least! One more\nand we can get out of this damn furnace! Who do we have, Morrow?'\nThe Under-Secretary frowned and pushed his glasses up his nose. 'Er…\nwe have one Yoru Sulfur,' he wrestled with the unfamiliar name.\n'We have a who?'\n'Er… Sulfir, or Sulfor, or something.'"

Some kind of a southerner? Not another peasant, please!'\nThe Under-Secretary examined his notes, and swallowed. 'An\nemissary?'\n'Yes, yes, but from whom?'\nMorrow was positively cringing, like a child expecting a slap. 'From the\nGreat Order of Magi!' he blurted out.\nThere was a moment of stunned silence. West's eyebrows went up and\nhis jaw came open, and he guessed that the same was happening, unseen,\nbehind the visors of the soldiers. He winced instinctively as he anticipated\nthe response of the Lord Chamberlain, but Hoff surprised them all by\nbursting into peals of laughter. 'Excellent! At last some entertainment. It's\nbeen years since we had a Magus here! Show in the wizard! We mustn't\nkeep him waiting!'\nYoru Sulfur was something of a disappointment. He had simple, travel-\nstained clothes, was scarcely better dressed than Goodman Heath had been,\nin fact. His staff was not shod with gold, had no lump of shining crystal on\nthe end. His eye did not flash with a mysterious fire. He looked a fairly\nordinary sort of a man in his middle thirties, slightly tired, as though after a\nlong journey, but otherwise well at his ease before the Lord Chamberlain.\n'A good day to you, gentlemen,' he said, leaning on his staff. West was\nhaving some difficulty working out where he was from. Not the Union,\nbecause his skin was too dark, and not Gurkhul or the far south, because his\nskin was too light. Not from the North or from Styria. Further then, but\nwhere? Now that West looked at him more closely he noticed that his eyes\nwere different colours: one blue, one green.\n'And a good day to you, sir,' said Hoff, smiling as though he really\nmeant it. 'My door is forever open to the Great Order of Magi. Tell me, do I\nhave the pleasure of addressing great Bayaz himself?'\nSulfur looked puzzled. 'No, was I wrongly announced? I am\nYoru Sulfur. Master Bayaz is a bald gentleman.' He pushed a hand through\nhis own head of curly brown hair. 'There is a statue of him outside in the\navenue. But I did have the honour to study under him for several years. He\nis a most powerful and knowledgeable master.'\n'Of course! Of course he is! And how may we be of service?'\nYoru Sulfur cleared his throat, as though to tell a story. 'On the death of\nKing Harod the Great, Bayaz, the First of the Magi, left the Union. But he\nswore an oath to return.'\n'Yes, yes, that's true,' chuckled Hoff. 'Very true, every school-child\nknows it.'\n'And he pronounced that, when he returned, his coming would be\nheralded by another.'\n'True, also.'\n'Well,' said Sulfur, smiling broadly, 'here I am.'"

'Here you are!' he shouted,\nthumping the table. Harlen Morrow allowed himself a little chuckle, but\nshut up immediately as Hoffs smile began to fade.\n'During my tenure as Lord Chamberlain, I have had three members of\nthe Great Order of Magi apply to me for audiences with the King. Two were\nmost clearly insane, and one was an exceptionally courageous swindler.' He\nleaned forward, placing his elbows on the table and steepling his fingers\nbefore him. 'Tell me, Master Sulfur, which kind of Magus are you?'\n'I am neither of those.'\n'I see. Then you will have documents.'\n'Of course.' Sulfur reached into his coat and brought out a small letter,\nclosed with a white seal, a single strange symbol stamped into it. He placed\nit carelessly on the table before the Lord Chamberlain.\nHoff frowned. He picked up the document and turned it over in his\nhands. He examined the seal carefully, then he dabbed his face with his\nsleeve, broke the wax, unfolded the thick paper and began to read.\nYoru Sulfur showed no sign of nerves. He didn't appear troubled by the\nheat. He strolled around the room, he nodded to the armoured soldiers, he\ndidn't seem upset by their lack of response. He turned suddenly to West. 'It's\nterribly hot in here, isn't it? It's a wonder these poor fellows don't pass out,\nand crash to the floor with a sound like a cupboard full of saucepans.' West\nblinked. He had been thinking the very same thing.\nThe Lord Chamberlain put the letter down carefully on the table, no\nlonger in the least amused. 'It occurs to me that the Open Council would be\nthe wrong place to discuss this matter.'\n'I agree. I was hoping for a private audience with Lord Chancellor\nFeekt.'\n'I am afraid that will not be possible.' Hoff licked his lips. 'Lord Feekt is\ndead.'\nSulfur frowned. 'That is most unfortunate.'\n'Indeed, indeed. We all feel his loss most keenly. Perhaps I and certain\nother members of the Closed Council can assist you.'\nSulfur bowed his head. 'I am guided by you, my Lord Chamberlain.'\n'I will try to arrange something for later this evening. Until then we will\nfind you some lodgings within the Agriont… suitable for your station.' He\nsignalled to the guards, and the doors were opened.\n'Thank you so much, Lord Hoff. Master Morrow. Major West.' Sulfur\nnodded to them graciously, each in turn, and then turned and left. The doors\nwere closed once more, leaving West wondering how the man had known\nhis name.\nHoff turned to his Under-Secretary for Audiences. 'Go immediately to\nArch Lector Sult, and tell him we must meet at once. Then fetch High\nJustice Marovia, and Lord Marshal Varuz.

He shook his finger in Morrow's sweaty face. 'Not a word!'\nThe Under-Secretary stared back, spectacles askew. 'Now!' roared Hoff.\nMorrow leapt to his feet, stumbled on the hem of his gown, then hurried out\nthrough a side door. West swallowed, his mouth very dry.\nHoff stared long and hard at each man in the room. 'As for the rest of\nyou, not a word to anyone about any of this, or the consequences for all of\nyou will be most severe! Now out, everyone out!' The soldiers clanked from\nthe room immediately. West needed no further encouragement and he\nhurried after them, leaving the brooding Lord Chamberlain alone in his high\nchair.\nWest's thoughts were dark and confused as he pulled the door shut\nbehind him. Fragments of old stories of the Magi, fears about war in the\nNorth, images of a hooded giant, towering up near the ceiling. There had\nbeen some strange and some sinister visitors to the Agriont that day, and he\nfelt quite weighed down by worries. He tried to shrug them off, told himself\nit was all foolishness, but then all he could think of was his sister, cavorting\nabout the Agriont like a fool.\nHe groaned to himself. She was probably with Luthar right now. Why\nthe hell had he introduced the two of them? For some reason he had been\nexpecting the same awkward, sickly, sharp-tongued girl he remembered\nfrom years ago. He had got quite a shock when this woman had turned up at\nhis quarters. He had barely recognised her. Undoubtedly a woman, and a\nfine-looking one too. Meanwhile, Luthar was arrogant and rich and\nhandsome and had all the self-restraint of a six-year old. He knew they had\nseen each other since, and more than once. Just as friends, of course. Ardee\nhad no other friends here. Just friends.\n'Shit!' he cursed. It was like putting a cat by the cream and trusting it not\nto stick its tongue in. Why the hell hadn't he thought it through? It was a\ndamn disaster in the making! But what could he do about it now? He stared\noff miserably down the hallway.\nThere's nothing like seeing another's misery to make you forget your\nown, and Goodman Heath was a sorry sight indeed. He was sitting alone on\na long bench, face deathly pale, staring off into space. He must have been\nsitting there all this time, while the Mercers and the Northmen and the\nMagus came and went, waiting for nothing but with nowhere left to go.\nWest glanced up and down the hallway. There was no one else nearby.\nHeath was oblivious to him, mouth open, eyes glassy, battered hat forgotten\non his knees.\nWest couldn't simply leave the man like this, he didn't have it in him.\n'Goodman Heath,' he said as he approached, and the peasant looked up\nat him, surprised. He fumbled for his hat and made to rise, muttering\napologies.\n'No, please, don't get up.' West sat down on the bench. He stared at his"

He stared at his\nfeet, unable to look the man in the eye. There was an awkward silence. 'I\nhave a friend who sits on the Commission for Land and Agriculture. There\nmight be something he can do for you…' He trailed off, embarrassed,\nsquinting up the corridor.\nThe farmer gave a sad smile. 'I'd be right grateful for anything you\ncould do.'\n'Yes, yes, of course, I'll do what I can.' It would do no good whatsoever,\nand they both knew it. West grimaced and bit his lip. 'You'd better take this,'\nand he pressed his purse into the peasant's limp, calloused fingers. Heath\nlooked at him, mouth slightly open. West gave a quick, awkward smile then\ngot to his feet. He was very keen to be off.\n'Sir!' called Goodman Heath after him, but West was already hurrying\ndown the corridor, and he didn't look back.\nOn the List\n« ^ »\nWhy do I do this?\nThe outline of Villem dan Robb's townhouse was cut out in black\nagainst the clear night sky. It was an unremarkable building, a two-storey-\ndwelling with a low wall and a gate in front, just like a hundred others in\nthis street. Our old friend Rews used to live in a palatial great villa near the\nmarket. Robb really should have asked him for some more ambitious bribes.\nStill. Lucky for us he didn't. Elsewhere in the city the fashionable avenues\nwould be brightly lit and busy with drunken revellers right through until\ndawn. But this secluded side street was far from the bright lights and the\nprying eyes.\nWe can work undisturbed.\nRound the side of the building, on the upper floor, a lamp was burning\nin a narrow window. Good. Our friend is at home. But still awake—we must\ntread gently. He turned to Practical Frost and pointed down the side of the\nhouse. The albino nodded and slipped away silently across the street.\nGlokta waited for him to reach the wall and disappear into the shadows\nbeside the building, then he turned to Severard and pointed at the front door.\nThe eyes of the lanky Practical smiled at him for a moment, then he scuttled\nquickly away, staying low, rolled over the low wall and dropped without a\nsound onto the other side.\nPerfect so far, but now I must move. Glokta wondered why he had\ncome. Frost and Severard were more than capable of dealing with Robb by\nthemselves, and he would only slow them down. I might even fall on my\narse and alert the idiot to our presence. So why did I come? But Glokta\nknew why. The feeling of excitement was already building in his throat. It\nfelt almost like being alive.\nHe had muffled the end of his cane with a bit of rag, so he was able to\nlimp to the wall, ever so delicately, without making too much noise.

That little wall might as\nwell be a hundred feet high for all my chances of getting over it.\nSeverard was kneeling on the step against the front door, picking the\nlock. His ear was close to the wood, his eyes squinting with concentration,\ngloved hands moving deftly. Glokta's heart was beating fast, his skin prickly\nwith tension. Ah, the thrill of the hunt.\nThere was a soft click, then another. Severard slipped his glittering\npicks into a pocket, then reached out and slowly, carefully turned the\ndoorknob. The door swung silently open. What a useful fellow he is.\nWithout him and Frost I am just a cripple. They are my hands, my arms, my\nlegs. But I am their brains. Severard slipped inside and Glokta followed\nhim, wincing with pain every time he put his weight on his left leg.\nThe hallway was dark, but there was a shaft of light spilling down the\nstairs from above and the banisters cast strange, distorted shadows on the\nwooden floor. Glokta pointed up the steps, and Severard nodded and began\nto tiptoe toward them, keeping his feet close to the wall. It seemed to take\nhim an age to get there.\nThe third step made a quiet creaking sound as he put his weight on it.\nGlokta winced, Severard froze in place. They waited, still as statues. There\nwas no sound from upstairs. Glokta began to breathe again. Severard moved\never so slowly upwards, step by gentle step. As he got towards the top he\npeered cautiously round the corner, back pressed against the wall, then he\ntook the last step and disappeared from view without a sound.\nPractical Frost emerged from the shadows at the far end of the corridor.\nGlokta raised an eyebrow at him but he shook his head. Nobody downstairs.\nHe turned to the front door and started to close it, ever so gently. Only when\nit was shut did he slowly, slowly release the doorknob, so the latch slid\nsilently into place.\n'You'll want to see this.'\nGlokta gave a start at the sudden sound, turning round quickly and\ncausing a jolt of pain to shoot through his back. Severard was standing,\nhands on hips, at the head of the stairs. He turned and made off towards the\nlight, and Frost bounded up the steps after him, no longer making any\npretence at stealth.\nWhy can no one ever stay on the ground floor? Always upstairs. At least\nhe didn't have to try to be quiet as he struggled up the steps after his\nPracticals, right foot creaking, left foot scraping on the boards. Bright\nlamplight was flooding out into the upstairs corridor from an open door at\nthe far end, and Glokta limped toward it. He paused as he crossed the\nthreshold, catching his breath after the climb.\nOh dear me, what a mess.

A glass\nof wine had been knocked over on the desk, making sodden red rags of the\ncrumpled papers strewn across it. The bed was in disarray, the covers pulled\nhalf off, the pillows and the mattress slashed and spilling feathers. A\nwardrobe had its doors open, one of them dangling half off. A few tattered\ngarments were hanging inside, but most were lying torn in a heap below.\nA handsome young man lay on his back under the window, staring up,\npale-faced and open mouthed at the ceiling. It would have been an\nunderstatement to say that his throat had been cut. It had been hacked so\nsavagely that his head was only just still attached. There was blood\nsplattered everywhere, on the torn clothes, on the slashed mattress, all over\nthe body itself. There were a couple of smeared, bloody palm-prints on the\nwall, a great pool of blood across a good part of the floor, still wet. He was\nkilled tonight. Perhaps only a few hours ago. Perhaps only a few minutes.\n'I don't think he'll be answering our questions,' said Severard.\n'No.' Glokta's eyes drifted over the wreckage. 'I think he might be dead.\nBut how did it happen?'\nFrost fixed him with a pink eye and raised a white eyebrow. 'Poithon?'\nSeverard spluttered with shrill laughter under his mask.

But how did our poison get in?'\n'Open wi'ow,' mumbled Frost, pointing at the floor.\nGlokta limped into the room, careful not to let his feet or his cane touch\nthe sticky mess of blood and feathers. 'So, our poison saw the lamp burning,\njust as we did. He entered via the downstairs window. He climbed silently\nup the stairs.' Glokta turned the corpse's hands over with the tip of his cane.\nA few specks of blood from the neck, but no damage to the knuckles or the\nfingers. He did not struggle. He was taken by surprise. He craned forward\nand peered at the gaping wound.\n'A single, powerful cut. Probably with a knife.'\n'And Villem dan Robb has sprung a most serious leak,' said Severard,\n'And we are short one informant,' mused Glokta. There had been no\nblood in the corridor. Our man took pains not to get his feet wet while\nsearching the room, however messy it may look. He was not angry or\nafraid. It was just a job.\n'The killer was a professional,' murmured Glokta, 'he came here with\nmurder in mind. Then perhaps he made this little effort to give the\nappearance of a burglary, who can say? Either way, the Arch Lector wont be\nsatisfied with a corpse.' He looked up at his two Practicals. 'Who's next on\nthe list?'\nThis time there had been a struggle, without a doubt.

The\nfour gaping knife wounds in his back had been the end of him.\nGlokta felt his face twitching as he looked down at the bloody corpse.\nOne body might just be a coincidence. Two make a conspiracy. His eyelid\nfluttered. Whoever did this knew we were coming, and when, and precisely\nwho for. They are one step ahead of us. More than likely, our list of\naccomplices has already become a list of corpses. There was a creaking\nsound behind Glokta and his head whipped round, sending shooting pains\ndown his stiff neck. Nothing but the open window swinging in the breeze.\nCalm, now. Calm, and think it out.\n'It would seem the honourable Guild of Mercers have been doing a little\nhousekeeping.'\n'How could they know?' muttered Severard.\nHow indeed? 'They must have seen Rews' list, or been told who was on\nit.' And that means… Glokta licked at his empty gums. 'Someone inside the\nInquisition has been talking.'\nFor once, Severard's eyes were not smiling. 'If they know who's on the\nlist, they know who wrote it. They know who we are.'\nThree more names on the list, perhaps? Down at the bottom? Glokta\ngrinned. How very exciting. 'You scared?'\n'I'm not happy, I'll tell you that.'

If I die, I'll never know\nwho betrayed us.\nAnd I want to know.\nA bright, cloudless spring day, and the park was busy with fops and idlers\nof every variety. Glokta sat very still on his bench, in the merciful shade of\na spreading tree, and stared out at the shimmering greenery, the sparkling\nwater, the happy, the drunken, the colourful revellers. There were people\nwedged together on the benches around the lake, pairs and groups scattered\naround the grass, drinking and talking and basking in the sun. There seemed\nno space for any more.\nBut no one came and sat next to Glokta. Occasionally somebody would\nhurry up, hardly able to believe their luck in finding such a spot, then they\nwould see him sitting there. Their faces would fall and they would swerve\naway, or walk right past as though they had never meant to sit. I drive them\naway as surely as the plague, but perhaps that's just as well. I don't need\ntheir company.\nHe watched a group of young soldiers rowing a boat on the lake. One of\nthem stood up, wobbling around, holding forth with a bottle in his hand.\nThe boat rocked alarmingly, and his companions shouted at him to get\ndown. Vague gales of good-natured laughter came wafting through the air,\ndelayed a little by the distance. Children. How young they look. How\ninnocent. And such was I, not long ago.

Glokta thought he\nlooked a little more tired, more lined, more drawn than usual as he stared\ncoldly down.\n'This had better be interesting.'

'All of\nthem?'\n'All of them.'\n'Hmm,' mused Sult. 'That is interesting. The Mercers are cleaning up,\nare they? I hardly expected such ruthlessness. Times have changed, alright,\ntimes have certainly…' He trailed off, slowly starting to frown. 'You think\nsomeone gave them Rews' list, don't you? You think one of ours has been\ntalking. That's why you asked me to come here, isn't it?'\nDid you think I was just avoiding the stairs? 'Each one of them killed?\nEach and every name on our list? The very night we go to arrest them? I am\nnot a great believer in coincidences.' Are you, Arch Lector?\nHe was evidently not. His face had turned very grim. 'Who saw the\nconfession?'\n'Me, and my two Practicals, of course.'\n'You have absolute confidence in them?'\n'Absolute.' There was a pause. The boat was drifting, rudderless, as the\nsoldiers scrambled about, oars sticking up in the air, the man in the water"

The boat was drifting, rudderless, as the\nsoldiers scrambled about, oars sticking up in the air, the man in the water\nsplashing and laughing, spraying water over his friends.\n'The confession was in my office for some time,' murmured the Arch\nLector. 'Some members of my staff could have seen it. Could have.'\n'You have absolute confidence in them, your Eminence?'\nSult stared at Glokta for a long, icy moment. 'They wouldn't dare. They\nknow me better than that.'\n'That leaves Superior Kalyne,' said Glokta quietly.\nThe Arch Lector's lips hardly moved as he spoke. 'You must tread\ncarefully, Inquisitor, very carefully. The ground is not at all safe where you\nare walking. Fools do not become Superiors of the Inquisition, despite\nappearances. Kalyne has many friends, both within the House of Questions\nand outside it. Powerful friends. Any accusation against him must be\nbacked up by the very strongest of proof.' Sult stopped suddenly, waiting\nfor a small group of ladies to pass out of earshot. 'The very strongest of\nproof,' he hissed, once they had moved away. 'You must find me this\nassassin.'\nEasier said than done. 'Of course, your Eminence, but my investigation\nhas reached something of a dead end.'\n'Not quite. We still have one card left to play. Rews himself.'\nRews? 'But, Arch Lector, he will be in Angland by now.' Sweating down\na mine or some such. If he has even lasted this long.\n'No. He is here in the Agriont, under lock and key. I thought it best to\nhold on to him.' Glokta did his utmost to contain his surprise. Clever. Very\nclever. Fools do not become Arch Lectors either, it seems. 'Rews will be\nyour bait. I will have my secretary carry a message to Kalyne, letting him\nknow that I have relented. That I am prepared to let the Mercers continue to\noperate, but under tighter control. That as a gesture of goodwill I have let\nRews go. If Kalyne is the source of our leak, I daresay he will let the\nMercers know that Rews is free. I daresay they will send this assassin to\npunish him for his loose tongue. I daresay you could take him while he is\ntrying. If the killer doesn't come, well, we might have to look for our traitor\nelsewhere, and we have lost nothing.'\n'An excellent plan, your Eminence.'\nSult stared at him coldly. 'Of course. You will need somewhere to\noperate, somewhere far from the House of Questions. I will make the funds\navailable, have Rews delivered to your Practicals, and let you know when\nKalyne has the information. Find me this assassin, Glokta, and squeeze him.\nSqueeze him until the pips squeak.' The boat lurched wildly as the soldiers\ntried to haul their wet companion in, then it suddenly turned right over,\ndumping them all into the water.\n'I want names,' hissed Sult, glowering at the splashing soldiers, 'I want"

He stood up smoothly from the bench. 'Keep me\ninformed.' He strode off towards the House of Questions, feet crunching on\nthe gravel of the path, and Glokta watched him go. An excellent plan. I'm\nglad you're on my side, Arch Lector. You are on my side, aren't you?\nThe soldiers had succeeded in hauling the upended boat onto the bank\nand were standing, dripping wet, shouting at one another, no longer so\ngood-humoured. One of the oars was still floating, abandoned in the water,\ndrifting gradually towards the point where the stream flowed from the lake.\nSoon it would pass under the bridge and be carried out, beneath the great\nwalls of the Agriont and into the moat. Glokta watched it turning slowly\nround in the water. A mistake. One should attend to the details. It is easy to\nforget the little things, but without the oar, the boat is useless.\nHe let his gaze wander across some of the other faces in the park. His\neye alighted on a handsome pair sitting on a bench by the lake. The young\nman was speaking quietly to the girl, a sad and earnest expression on his\nface. She got up quickly, moving away from him with her hands over her\nface. Ah, the pain of the jilted lover. The loss, the anger, the shame. It seems\nas though you'll never recover. What poet was it who wrote there's no pain\nworse than the pain of a broken heart? Sentimental shit. He should have\nspent more time in the Emperor's prisons. He smiled, opening his mouth\nand licking the empty gums where his front teeth used to be. Broken hearts\nheal with time, but broken teeth never do.\nGlokta looked at the young man. He had an expression of slight\namusement on his face as he watched the weeping girl walk away. The\nyoung bastard. I wonder if he's broken as many hearts as I did, in my\nyouth? It hardly seems possible now. It takes me half an hour just to pluck\nup the courage to stand. The only women I've made cry lately have been the\nwives of those I've had exiled to Angland—\n'Sand.'\nGlokta turned around. 'Lord Marshal Varuz, what an honour.'\n'Oh no, no,' said the old soldier, sitting down on the bench with the\nswift, precise movements of the fencing master. 'You look well,' he said, but\nwithout really looking. I look crippled, you mean. 'How are you, my old\nfriend?' I'm crippled, you pompous old ass. And friend, is it? All those years\nsince I came back, and you have never sought me out, not once. Is that a\nfriendship?\n'Well enough, thank you, Lord Marshal.'\nVaruz shifted uncomfortably on the bench.

Only he's wasting it. Throwing it away.' Oh, the tragedy of\nit. I am so upset I could be sick. Had I eaten anything this morning.\n'He is lazy, Sand, and stubborn. He lacks courage. He lacks dedication.\nHis heart is just not in it, and time is running out. I was wondering, if you\nhave the time of course,' Varuz looked Glokta in the eye for just an instant,\n'whether you might be able to speak to him for me.'\nI can hardly wait! Lecturing that whining ass would be the realisation\nof all my dreams. You arrogant old dolt, how dare you? You built your\nreputation on my successes, then when I needed your help you cut me off.\nAnd now you come to me, and seek my help, and call me friend?\n'Of course, Marshal Varuz, I would be glad to speak to him. Anything\nfor an old friend.'\n'Excellent, excellent! I'm sure you'll make all the difference! I train him\nevery morning, in that courtyard near the House of the Maker, where I used\nto train you…' The old Marshal trailed off awkwardly.\n'I will come as soon as my duties permit.'\n'Of course, your duties…' Varuz was already getting up, evidently keen\nto be on his way. Glokta held out his hand, making the old soldier pause for\na moment. You needn't worry, Lord Marshal, I am not contagious. Varuz\ngave it a limp shake, as though worried it might snap off, then he mumbled\nhis excuses and strode away, head held high. The dripping soldiers bowed\nand saluted as he walked past, somewhat embarrassed.\nGlokta stretched out his leg, wondering whether to get up. And go\nwhere? The world will not end if I sit here a moment longer. There is no\nrush. No rush.\nAn Offer and a Gift\n« ^ »\n'And, forward!' bellowed Marshal Varuz. Jezal lurched at him, toes curling\nround the edges of the beam, trying desperately to keep his balance, making\na clumsy lunge or two just to give the impression of his heart being in it.\nFour hours of training a day were taking their toll on him, and he felt\nbeyond mere exhaustion.\nVaruz frowned and flicked Jezal's blunted steel aside, moving\neffortlessly along the beam as though it was a garden path. 'And back!'\nJezal stumbled back on his heels, left arm waving stupidly around him\nin an attempt to keep his balance. Everything above his knees was aching\nterribly from the effort. Below the knees it was much, much worse. Varuz\nwas over sixty, but he showed no signs of fatigue. He wasn't even sweating\nas he danced forward down the beam, swishing his steels around. Jezal"

Jezal\nhimself was gasping for air as he parried desperately with his left hand,\nbadly off balance, his right foot fishing in space for the safety of the beam\nbehind him.\n'And, forward!' Jezal's calves were agony as he stumbled to change his\ndirection and shove a blow at the infuriating old man, but Varuz did not\nmove back. Instead he ducked under the despairing cut and used the back of\nhis arm to sweep Jezal's feet away.\nJezal let out a howl as the courtyard turned over around him. His leg\nsmacked painfully against the edge of the beam, then he sprawled on his\nface on the grass, chin thumping into the turf and making his teeth rattle. He\nrolled a short distance then lay there on his back, gasping like a fish\nsnatched suddenly from the water, leg throbbing where it had collided with\nthe beam on his way down. He would have yet another ugly bruise in the\nmorning.\n'Awful, Jezal, awful!' cried the old soldier as he sprang nimbly down\nonto the lawn. 'You teeter about the beam as though it were a tightrope!'\nJezal rolled over, cursing, and started to climb stiffly to his feet. 'It is a solid\npiece of oak, wide enough to get lost in!' The Lord Marshal illustrated his\npoint by whacking at the beam with his short steel, making splinters fly.\n'I thought you said forward,' moaned Jezal.\nVaruz' eyebrows went up sharply. 'Do you seriously suppose, Captain\nLuthar, that Bremer dan Gorst gives his opponents reliable information as to\nhis intentions?'\n'Bremer dan Gorst will be trying to beat me, you old shit! You are\nsupposed to be helping me to beat him!' That was what Jezal thought, but he\nknew better than to say it. He just shook his head dumbly.\n'No! No indeed he does not! He makes every effort to deceive and\nconfuse his opponents, as all great swordsmen must!' The Lord Marshal\npaced up and down, shaking his head. Jezal considered again whether to\ngive it all up. He was sick of falling into bed exhausted each night, at a time\nwhen he should have been just starting to get drunk. He was sick of waking\nup every morning, bruised and aching, to face another four interminable\nhours of running, beam, bar, forms. He was sick of being knocked on his\narse by Major West. Most of all he was sick of being bullied by this old\nfool.\n'…A depressing display, Captain, very depressing. I do believe you are\nactually getting worse…'\nJezal would never win the Contest. No one expected him to, himself\nleast of all. So why not give it up, and go back to his cards and late nights?\nWasn't that all he really wanted from life?

He\nwanted people to fawn and smile around him and hang on his every word.\nHe wanted people to whisper, 'There goes Lord Luthar!' as he swept past.\nCould he be happy being forever a richer, cleverer, better-looking version of\nLieutenant Brint? Ugh! It was not to be thought of.\n'…We have a terribly long way to go, and not enough time to get there,\nnot unless you change your attitude. Your sparring is lamentable, your\nstamina is still weak, and as for your balance, the less said about that the\nbetter…'\nAnd what would everyone else think if he gave up? What would his\nfather do? What would his brothers say? What about the other officers? He\nwould look a coward. And then there was Ardee West. She seemed to have\nbeen much on his mind during the past couple of days. Would she lean so\nclose to him if he didn't fence? Would she talk to him in such soft tones?\nWould she laugh at his jokes? Would she look up at him with those big,\ndark eyes, so he could almost feel her breath on his face—\n'Are you listening, boy?' thundered Varuz. Jezal felt a bit of his breath\non his face alright, and a deal of spit too.\n'Yes, sir! Sparring lamentable, stamina weak!' Jezal swallowed\nnervously. 'Less said about balance the better.'\n'That's right! I am beginning to think, though I can hardly believe it after\nthe trouble you have put me to, that your heart really isn't in this.' He glared\ninto Jezal's eyes. 'What do you think, Major?'\nThere was no reply. West was slumped in his chair, arms folded,\nfrowning grimly and staring into space.\n'Major West?' snapped the Lord Marshal.\nHe looked up suddenly, as though he had only just become aware of\ntheir presence. 'I'm sorry, sir, I had become distracted.'\n'So I see.' Varuz sucked his teeth. 'It seems that nobody has been\nconcentrating this morning.' It was a great relief that some of the old man's\nanger had been deflected elsewhere, but Jezal's happiness was not long-\nlived.\n'Very well,' snapped the old Marshal, 'if that's the way you want it.\nStarting tomorrow we will begin each session with a swim in the moat. A\nmile or two should do it.' Jezal squeezed his teeth together to keep from\nscreaming. 'Cold water has a wonderful way of sharpening the senses. And\nperhaps we need to start a little earlier, to catch you in your most receptive\nframe of mind. That means we begin at five. In the meantime, Captain\nLuthar, I suggest that you consider whether you are here in order to win the\nContest, or simply for the pleasure of my company.' And he turned on his\nheel and stalked off.\nJezal waited until Varuz had left the courtyard before losing his temper,"

And he turned on his\nheel and stalked off.\nJezal waited until Varuz had left the courtyard before losing his temper,\nbut once he was sure the old man was out of earshot he flung his steels\nagainst the wall in a fury.\n'Damn it!' he shouted as the swords rattled to the ground. 'Shit!' He\nlooked around for something to kick that wouldn't hurt too much. His eye\nlighted on the leg of the beam, but he misjudged the kick badly and had to\nstifle the urge to grab his bruised foot and hop around like an idiot. 'Shit,\nshit!' he raged.\nWest was disappointingly unimpressed. He got up, frowning, and made\nto follow Marshal Varuz.\n'Where are you off to?' asked Jezal.\n'Away,' said West, over his shoulder, 'I've seen enough.'\n'What does that mean?'\nWest stopped and turned to face him. 'Amazing though it may seem,\nthere are bigger problems in the world than this.'\nJezal stood there open mouthed as West stalked from the courtyard. 'Just\nwho do you think you are?' he shouted after him, once he was sure he was\ngone. 'Shit, shit!' He considered giving the beam another kick, but thought\nbetter of it.\nJezal was in a foul mood on his way back to his quarters, so he stayed away\nfrom the busier parts of the Agriont, sticking to the quieter lanes and\ngardens to the side of the Kingsway. He glowered down at his feet as he\nwalked, to further discourage any social encounter. But luck was not on his\nside.\n'Jezal!' It was Kaspa, out for a stroll with a yellow-haired girl in\nexpensive clothes. They had a severe-looking middle-aged woman with\nthem, no doubt the girl's governess or some such. They had stopped to\nadmire some piece of minor sculpture in a little-visited yard.\n'Jezal!' Kaspa shouted again, waving his hat above his head. There was\nno avoiding them. He plastered an unconvincing smile onto his face and\nstalked over. The pale girl smiled at him as he approached, but if he was\nmeant to be charmed he didn't feel it.\n'Been fencing again, Luthar?' asked Kaspa pointlessly. Jezal was\nsweating and holding a pair of fencing steels. It was well known that he\nfenced every morning. You didn't need a fine mind to make the connection,\nwhich was fortunate, because Kaspa certainly didn't have one.\n'Yes. How did you guess?' Jezal hadn't meant to kill the conversation\nquite so dead, but he passed it off with a false chuckle, and the smiles of the\nladies soon returned.\n'Hah, hah,' laughed Kaspa, ever willing to be the butt of a joke.\n'Jezal, may I introduce my cousin, the Lady Ariss dan Kaspa? This is\nmy superior officer, Captain Luthar.' So this was the famous cousin. One of\nthe Unions richest heiresses and from an excellent family.

She smiled weakly and offered out her\nlimp, white hand.\nHe brushed it with the most perfunctory of kisses. 'Charmed,' he\nmuttered, without relish. 'I must apologise for my appearance, I've just been\nfencing.'\n'Yes,' she squeaked, in a high, piping voice, once she was sure he had\nfinished speaking. 'I have heard you are a great fencer.' There was a pause\nwhile she groped for something to say, then her eyes lit up. 'Tell me\nCaptain, is fencing really very dangerous?'\nWhat insipid drivel. 'Oh no, my lady, we only use blunted steels in the\ncircle.' He could have said more, but he was damned if he was going to\nmake all the effort. He gave a thin smile. So did she. The conversation\nhovered over the abyss.\nJezal was about to make his excuses, the subject of fencing evidently\nexhausted, but Ariss cut him off by blundering on to another topic. 'And tell\nme, Captain, is there really likely to be a war in the North?' Her voice had\nalmost entirely faded away by the end of the sentence, but the chaperone\nstared on approvingly, no doubt delighted by the conversational skills of her\ncharge.\nSpare us. 'Well it seems to me…' Jezal began. The pale, blue eyes of\nLady Ariss stared back at him expectantly. Blue eyes are absolute crap, he\nreflected. He wondered which subject she was more ignorant of: fencing or\npolitics? 'What do you think?'\nThe chaperone's brow furrowed slightly. Lady Ariss looked somewhat\ntaken aback, blushing slightly as she groped for words. 'Well, er… that is to\nsay… I'm sure that everything will… turn out well?'\nThank the fates! thought Jezal, we are saved! He had to get out of here.\n'Of course, everything will turn out well.' He forced out one more smile. 'It\nhas been a real pleasure to make your acquaintance, but I'm afraid I'm on\nduty shortly, so I must leave you.' He bowed with frosty formality.\n'Lieutenant Kaspa, Lady Ariss.'\nKaspa clapped him on the arm, as friendly as ever. His ignorant waif of\na cousin smiled uncertainly. The governess frowned at him as he passed, but\nJezal took no notice.\nHe arrived at the Lords' Round just as the council members were returning\nfrom their lunchtime recess. He acknowledged the guards in the vestibule\nwith a terse nod, then strode through the enormous doorway and down the\ncentral isle. A straggling column of the greatest peers of the realm were\nhard on his heels, and the echoing space was full of shuffling footsteps,\ngrumblings and whisperings, as Jezal made his way around the curved wall\nto his place behind the high table.\n'Jezal, how was fencing?' It was Jalenhorm, here early for once, and\nseizing on the opportunity to talk before the Lord Chamberlain arrived."

I met that cousin of Kaspa's, you\nknow,' he searched for the name.\nJezal sighed. 'Lady Ariss.'\n'Yes, that's it! Have you seen her?'\n'I was lucky enough to run into them just now.'\n'Phew!' exclaimed Jalenhorm, pursing his lips. 'Isn't she stunning?'\n'Hmm.' Jezal looked away, bored, and watched the robed and fur-\ntrimmed worthies file slowly to their places. At least he watched a sample\nof their least favourite sons and paid representatives. Very few of the\nmagnates turned up in person for Open Council these days, not unless they\nhad something significant to complain about. A lot of them didn't even\nbother to send someone in their place.\n'I swear, one of the finest-looking girls I ever saw. I know Kaspa's\nalways raving about her, but he didn't do her justice.'\n'Hmm.' The councillors began to spread out, each man towards his own\nseat. The Lords' Round was designed like a theatre, the Union's leading\nnoblemen sitting where the audience would be, on a great half-circle of\nbanked benches with an aisle down the centre.\nAs in the theatre, some seats were better than others. The least important\nsat high up at the back, and the occupants' significance increased as you\ncame forward. The front row was reserved for the heads of the very greatest\nfamilies, or whoever they sent in their stead. Representatives from the\nsouth, from Dagoska and Westport, were on the left, nearest to Jezal. On the\nfar right were those from the north and west, from Angland and Starikland.\nThe bulk of the seating, in between, was for the old nobility of Midderland,\nthe heart of the Union. The Union proper, as they would have seen it. As\nJezal saw it too, for that matter.\n'What poise, what grace,' Jalenhorm was rhapsodising, 'that wonderful\nfair hair, that milky-white skin, those fantastic blue eyes.'\n'And all of that money.'\n'Well yes, that too,' smiled the big man. 'Kaspa says his uncle is even\nricher than his father. Imagine that! And he has just the one child. She will\ninherit every mark of it. Every mark!' Jalenhorm could scarcely contain his\nexcitement. 'It's a lucky man that can bag her! What was her name again?'\n'Ariss,' said Jezal sourly. The Lords, or their proxies, had all shuffled\nand grumbled their way to their seats. It was a poor attendance: the benches\nwere less than half full. That was about as full as it ever got. If the Lords'\nRound really had been a theatre, its owners would have been desperately in\nsearch of a new play.\n'Ariss. Ariss.' Jalenhorm smacked his lips as though the name left a\nsweet taste.

Providing he prefers cash to conversation,\nthat is. Jezal thought he might have preferred to marry the governess. At\nleast she had seemed to have a bit of backbone.\nThe Lord Chamberlain had entered the hall now, and was making his\nway towards the dais on which the high table stood, just about where the\nstage would have been, had the Round been a theatre. He was followed by a\ngaggle of black-gowned secretaries and clerks, each man more or less\nencumbered with heavy books and sheaves of official-looking papers. With\nhis crimson robes of state flapping behind him, Lord Hoff looked like\nnothing so much as a rare and stately gliding bird, pursued by a flock of\ntroublesome crows.\n'Here comes old vinegar,' whispered Jalenhorm, as he sidled off to find\nhis place on the other side of the table. Jezal put his hands behind his back\nand struck the usual pose, feet a little spread, chin high in the air. He swept\nan eye over the soldiers, regularly spaced around the curved wall, but each\nman was motionless and perfectly presented in full armour, as always. He\ntook a deep breath and prepared himself for several hours of the most\nextreme tedium.\nThe Lord Chamberlain threw himself into his tall chair and called for\nwine. The secretaries took their places around him, leaving a space in the\ncentre for the King, who was absent as usual. Documents were rustled,\ngreat ledgers were heaved open, pens were sharpened and rattled in ink\nwells. The Announcer walked to the end of the table and struck his staff of\noffice on the floor for order. The whispering of the noblemen and their\nproxies, and that of the few attendees in the public gallery over their heads,\ngradually died down, leaving the vast chamber silent.\nThe Announcer puffed out his chest. 'I call this meeting,' he said, in\nslow and sonorous tones, as though he were giving the eulogy at a funeral,\n'of the Open Council of the Union…' he gave an unnecessarily long and\nsignificant pause. The Lord Chamberlain's eyes flicked angrily towards\nhim, but the Announcer was not to be robbed of his moment of glory. He\nmade everyone wait an instant longer before finishing, '… to order!'\n'Thank you,' said Hoff sourly. 'I believe we were about to hear from the\nLord Governor of Dagoska before we were interrupted by luncheon.' The\nscratching nibs of quills accompanied his voice, as two clerks recorded his\nevery word. The faint echoes of the pens merged with the echoes of his\nwords in the great space above.\nAn elderly man struggled to his feet in the front row close to Jezal,\nsome papers clasped before him in shaky hands.\n'The Open Council,' droned the Announcer, as ponderously as he dared,\n'recognises Rush dan Thuel, accepted proxy of Sand dan Vurms, the Lord\nGovernor of Dagoska!'\n'Thank you, sir.'

His voice had already faded to its original, barely\naudible level, each word accompanied by the persistent scratching of quills.\nWhispers began to emanate from the public gallery above, making it still\nharder to hear him. 'The threat posed to that great city by the Emperor of\nGurkhul increases with every passing day.'\nVague sounds of disapproval began to float up from the far side of the\nroom, where the representatives from Angland were seated, but the bulk of\nthe councillors simply looked bored. 'Attacks on shipping, harassment of\ntraders, and demonstrations beyond our walls, have compelled the Lord\nGovernor to send me—'\n'Lucky us!' somebody shouted. There was another wave of laughter,\nslightly louder this time.\n'The city is built on but a narrow peninsula,' persisted the old man,\nstraining to make himself heard over the increasing background noise,\n'attached to a land controlled entirely by our bitter enemies the Gurkish, and\nseparated from Midderland by wide leagues of salt water! Our defences are\nnot all they might be! The Lord Governor is sorely in need of more funds…'\nThe mention of funds brought instant uproar from the assembly. Thud's\nmouth was still moving, but there was no chance of hearing him now. The\nLord Chamberlain frowned and took a swallow from his goblet. The clerk\nfurthest from Jezal had laid down his quill and was rubbing his eyes with\nhis inky thumb and forefinger. The clerk closest had just finished writing a\nline. Jezal craned forward to see. It said simply:\nSome shouting here.\nThe Announcer thumped his staff on the tiles with a look of great self-\nsatisfaction. The hubbub eventually died down but Thuel had now been\ntaken with a coughing fit. He tried to speak but was unable, and eventually\nhe waved his hand and sat down, very red in the face, while his neighbour\nthumped him on the back.\n'If I may, Lord Chamberlain?' shouted a fashionable young man in the\nfront row on the other side of the hall, leaping to his feet. The scratching of\nthe quills began once again. 'It seems to me—'\n'The Open Council,' cut in the Announcer, 'recognises Hersel dan Meed,\nthird son and accepted proxy of Fedor dan Meed, the Lord Governor of\nAngland!'\n'It seems to me,' continued the handsome young man, only slightly\nannoyed by this interruption, 'that our friends in the south are forever\nexpecting a full-scale attack by the Emperor!' Dissenting voices were now\nraised on the other side of the room. 'An attack which never materialises!\nDid we not defeat the Gurkish only a few short years ago, or does my\nmemory deceive me?' The booing increased in volume. 'This"

The booing increased in volume. 'This\nscaremongering represents an unacceptable drain on the Union's resources!'\nHe was shouting to be heard. 'In Angland we have many miles of border\nand too few soldiers, while the threat from Bethod and his Northmen is very\nreal! If anyone is in need of funds…'\nThe shouting was instantly redoubled. Cries of 'Hear, hear!',\n'Nonsense!', 'True!' and 'Lies!' could be vaguely made out over the hubbub.\nSeveral of the representatives were on their feet, shouting. Some vigorously\nnodded their agreement, some violently shook their heads in dissent. Others\nyawned and stared around. Jezal could see one fellow, near to the back in\nthe centre, who was almost certainly asleep, and in imminent danger of\nslumping into his neighbour's lap.\nHe allowed his eyes to wander up, over the faces ranged around the rail\nof the public gallery. He felt a strange tugging in his chest. Ardee West was\nup there, looking straight down at him. As their eyes met she smiled and\nwaved. He was smiling himself, with his arm halfway up to wave, when he\nremembered where he was. He pushed his arm behind his back and looked\naround nervously, but was relieved to find that no one important had\nnoticed his mistake. The smile would not quite leave his face though.\n'My Lords!' roared the Lord Chamberlain, smashing his empty goblet\ndown on the high table. He had the loudest voice Jezal had ever heard. Even\nMarshal Varuz could have learned a thing or two about shouting from Hoff.\nThe sleeping man near the back started up, sniffing and blinking. The noise\ndied away almost immediately. Those representatives left standing looked\naround guiltily, like naughty children called to account, and gradually sat\ndown. The whispers from the public gallery went still. Order was restored.\n'My Lords! I can assure you, the King has no more serious concern than\nthe safety of his subjects, no matter where they are! The Union does not\npermit aggression against its people or property!' Hoff punctuated each\ncomment by smashing his fist down in front of him. 'From the Emperor of\nGurkhul, from these savages in the North, or from anyone else!' He struck\nthe table so hard on this last comment that ink splashed from a well and ran\nall over one of the clerks' carefully prepared documents. Calls of agreement\nand support greeted the Lord Chamberlain's patriotic display.\n'As for the specific circumstance of Dagoska!' Thuel looked up\nhopefully, chest still shaking with suppressed coughs. 'Is that city not\npossessed of some of the most powerful and extensive defences in the\nworld? Did it not resist a siege by the Gurkish, less than a decade ago, for\nover a year? What has become of the walls, sir, the walls?' The great room\nfell quiet as everyone strained to hear the reply.\n'Lord Chamberlain,' wheezed Thuel, his voice nearly drowned out as\none of the clerks turned the crackling page of his huge book and began\nscratching on the next, 'the defences have fallen into poor repair, and we"

The Emperor is not\nignorant of this,' he whispered, all but inaudible, 'I beg of you…' He\ndissolved into another fit of coughing, and dropped into his seat,\naccompanied by some light jeering from the Angland delegation.\nHoff frowned even more deeply. 'It was my understanding that the\ndefences of the city were to be maintained by monies raised locally, and by\ntrade levies upon the Honourable Guild of Spicers, who have operated in\nDagoska under an exclusive and highly profitable licence these past seven\nyears. If resources cannot be found even to maintain the walls,' and he\nswept the assembly with a dark eye, 'perhaps it is time that this licence was\nput out to tender.' There was a volley of angry mutterings around the public\ngallery.\n'In any case, the Crown can spare no extra monies at present!' Jeers of\ndissatisfaction came from the Dagoska side of the room, hoots of agreement\nfrom the Angland side.\n'As for the specific circumstance of Angland!' thundered the Lord\nChamberlain, turning toward Meed. 'I believe we may shortly hear some\ngood news, for you to take back to your father the Lord Governor.' A cloud\nof excited whisperings rose up into the gilded dome above. The handsome\nyoung man looked pleasantly surprised, as well he might. It was rare indeed\nthat anyone took good news away from the Open Council, or news of any\nkind for that matter.\nThuel had got control of his lungs once more, and he opened his mouth\nto speak, but he was interrupted by a great beating on the huge door behind\nthe high table. The Lords looked up: surprised, expectant. The Lord\nChamberlain smiled, in the manner of a magician who has just pulled off an\nexceptionally difficult trick. He signalled to the guards, the heavy iron bolts\nwere drawn back, and the great, inlaid doors creaked slowly open.\nEight Knights of the Body, encased in glittering armour, faceless behind\nhigh, polished helmets, resplendent in purple cloaks marked on the back\nwith a golden sun, stomped in unison down the steps and took their places\nto either side of the high table. They were closely followed by four\ntrumpeters, who stepped smartly forward, raised their shining instruments\nto their lips and blew an ear-splitting fanfare. Jezal gritted his rattling teeth\nand narrowed his eyes, but eventually the ringing echoes faded. The Lord\nChamberlain turned angrily toward the Announcer, who was staring at the\nnew arrivals with his mouth open.\n'Well?' hissed Hoff.\nThe Announcer jumped to life. 'Ah… yes of course! My Lords and\nLadies, I have the great honour to present…' he paused and took a huge\nbreath, '…his Imperial Highness, the King of Angland, of Starikland, and of\nMidderland, the Protector of Westport and of Dagoska, his August Majesty,\nGuslav the Fifth, High King of the Union!'

There was a great rustling noise\nas every man and woman in the hall shifted from their seats and down onto\none knee.\nThe royal palanquin processed slowly through the doors, carried on the\nshoulders of six more faceless knights. The King was sitting in a gilded\nchair on top, propped up on rich cushions and swaying gently from side to\nside. He was staring about him with the startled expression of a man who\nwent to sleep drunk, and has woken up in an unfamiliar room.\nHe looked awful. Enormously fat, lolling like a great hill swathed in fur\nand red silk, head squashed into his shoulders by the weight of the great,\nsparkling crown. His eyes were glassy and bulging, with huge dark bags\nhanging beneath, and the pink point of his tongue kept flicking nervously\nover his pale lips. He had great low jowls and a roll of fat around his neck,\nin fact his whole face gave the appearance of having slightly melted and\nstarted to run down off his skull. Such was the High King of the Union, but\nJezal bowed his head a little lower as the palanquin approached, just the\nsame.\n'Oh,' muttered his August Majesty, as though he had forgotten\nsomething, 'please rise.' The rustling noise filled the hall again as everybody\nrose and returned to their seats. The King turned toward Hoff, brow deeply\nfurrowed, and Jezal heard him say, 'Why am I here?'\n'The Northmen, your Majesty.'\n'Oh yes!' The King's eyes lit up. He paused. 'What about them?'\n'Er…' but the Lord Chamberlain was saved from replying by the\nopening of the doors on the opposite side of the hall, the ones through\nwhich Jezal had first entered. Two strange men strode through and\nadvanced down the aisle.\nOne was a grizzled old warrior with a scar and a blind eye, carrying a\nflat wooden box. The other was cloaked and hooded, every feature hidden,\nand so big that he made the whole hall seem out of proportion. The benches,\nthe tables, even the guards, all suddenly looked like small versions designed\nfor the use of children. As he passed, a couple of the representatives closest\nto the aisle cringed and shuffled away. Jezal frowned to himself. This\nhooded giant did not have the look of good news, whatever Lord Hoff\nmight say. Angry and suspicious mutterings filled the echoing dome as the\ntwo Northmen took their places on the tiled floor before the high table.\n'Your Majesty,' said the Announcer, bowing so ridiculously low that he\nhad to support himself with his staff, 'the Open Council recognises Fenris\nthe Feared, the envoy of Bethod, King of the Northmen, and his translator,\nWhite-Eye Hansul!'\nThe King was staring off happily towards one of the great windows in\nthe curved wall, utterly oblivious, perhaps admiring the way the light shone\nthrough the beautiful stained glass, but he looked suddenly round, jowls\nvibrating, as the old half-blind warrior addressed him.\n'Your Majesty.

I bring brotherly greetings from my master, Bethod,\nKing of the Northmen.' The Round had fallen very still, and the clerks'\nscratching nibs seemed absurdly loud. The old warrior nodded at the great\nhooded shape beside him with an awkward smile. 'Fenris the Feared brings\nan offer from Bethod to yourself. From King to King. From the North to the\nUnion. An offer, and a gift.' And he raised the wooden box.\nThe Lord Chamberlain gave a self-satisfied smirk. 'Speak your offer\nfirst.'\n'It is an offer of peace. An endless peace between our two great nations.'\nWhite-Eye bowed again. His manners were impeccable,\nJezal had to admit. Not what one would expect from savages of the cold\nand distant North. His goodly speech would almost have been enough to put\nthe room at ease, had it not been for the hooded man beside him, looming\nlike a dark shadow.\nThe King's face twitched into a weak smile at this mention of peace\nhowever. 'Good,' he muttered. 'Excellent. Peace. Capital. Peace is good.'\n'He asks but one small thing in return,' said White-Eye.\nThe Lord Chamberlain's face had turned suddenly dour, but it was too\nlate. 'He has but to name it,' said the King, smiling indulgently.\nThe hooded man stepped forward. 'Angland,' he hissed.\nThere was a moment of stillness, then the hall exploded with noise.\nThere was a gale of disbelieving laughter from the public gallery. Meed was\non his feet, red-faced and screaming. Thuel tottered up from his bench, then\nfell back coughing. Angry bellows were joined by hoots of derision. The\nKing was staring about him with all the dignity of a startled rabbit.\nJezal's eyes were fixed on the hooded man. He saw a great hand slip out\nfrom his sleeve and reach for the clasp on his cloak. He blinked in surprise.\nWas the hand blue? Or was it just a trick of the light through the stained\nglass? The cloak dropped to the floor.\nJezal swallowed, his heart thumping loud in his ears. It was like staring\nat a terrible wound: the more he was revolted, the less he could look away.\nThe laughter died, the shouting died, the great space became terribly still\nonce more.\nFenris the Feared seemed larger yet without his cloak, towering over his\ncringing translator. Without any doubt, he was the biggest man that Jezal\nhad ever seen, if man he was. His face was in constant, twisted, sneering\nmotion. His bulging eyes twitched and blinked as they stared crazily round\nat the assembly. His thin lips smiled and grimaced and frowned by turns,\nnever still. But all this seemed ordinary, by comparison with his strangest\nfeature.\nHis whole left side, from head to toe, was covered in writing.\nCrabby runes were scrawled across the left half of his shaven head,\nacross his eyelid, his lips, his scalp, his ear. His huge left arm was tattooed\nblue with tiny writing, from bulging shoulder to the tips of his long fingers."

His huge left arm was tattooed\nblue with tiny writing, from bulging shoulder to the tips of his long fingers.\nEven his bare left foot was covered in strange letters. An enormous,\ninhuman, painted monster stood at the very heart of the Union's\ngovernment. Jezal's jaw hung open.\nAround the high table there were fourteen Knights of the Body, each\nman a hard-trained fighter of good blood. There were perhaps forty\nguardsmen of Jezal's own company around the walls, each one a seasoned\nveteran. They outnumbered these two Northmen more than twenty to one,\nand were well armed with the best steel the King's armouries could provide.\nFenris the Feared carried no weapon. For all his size and strangeness, he\nshould have been no threat to them.\nBut Jezal did not feel safe. He felt alone, weak, helpless, and terribly\nafraid. His skin was tingling, his mouth was dry. He felt a sudden urge to\nrun, and hide, and never come out again.\nAnd this strange effect was not limited to him, or even to those around\nthe high table. Angry laughs turned to shocked gurgles as the painted\nmonster turned slowly around in the centre of the circular floor, flickering\neyes running over the crowd. Meed shrank back onto his bench, anger all\nleached out of him. A couple of worthies on the front row actually\nscrambled over the backs of their benches and into the row behind. Others\nlooked away, or covered their faces with their hands. One of the soldiers\ndropped his spear, and it clattered loudly to the floor.\nFenris the Feared turned slowly to the high table, raising his great\ntattooed fist, opening his chasm of a mouth, a hideous spasm running over\nhis face. 'Angland!' he screamed, louder and more terrible by far than the\nLord Chamberlain had ever been. The echoes of his voice bounced off the\ndomed ceiling high above, resounded from the curved walls, filling the\ngreat space with piercing sound.\nOne of the Knights of the Body stumbled back and slipped, his\narmoured leg clanking against the edge of the high table.\nThe King shrank back and covered his face with his hand, one terrified\neye staring out from between his fingers, crown teetering on his head.\nThe quill of one of the clerks dropped from his nerveless fingers. The\nhand of the other moved across the paper by habit while his mouth fell\nopen, scrawling a messy word diagonally through the neat lines of script\nabove.\nAngland.\nThe Lord Chamberlain's face had turned waxy pale. He reached slowly\nfor his goblet, raised it to his lips. It was empty. He placed it carefully back\ndown on the table, but his hand was trembling, and the base rattled on the\nwood. He paused for a moment, breathing heavily through his nose.\n'Plainly, this offer is not acceptable.'\n'That is unfortunate,' said White-Eye Hansul, 'but there is still the gift.'\nEvery eye turned towards him.

On\noccasion, when there is bad blood between two clans, when there is the\nthreat of war, champions come forward from each side, to fight for all their\npeople, so that the issue might be decided… with only one death.'\nHe slowly opened the lid of the wooden box. There was a long knife\ninside, blade polished mirror-bright. 'His Greatness, Bethod, sends the\nFeared not only as his envoy, but as his champion. He will fight for\nAngland, if any here will face him, and spare you a war you will not win.'\nHe held the box up to the painted monster. 'This is my master's gift to you,\nand there could be none richer… your lives.'\nFenris' right hand darted out and snatched the knife from the box. He\nraised it high, blade flashing in the coloured light from the great windows.\nThe knights should have jumped forward. Jezal should have drawn his\nsword. All should have rushed to the defence of the King, but nobody\nmoved. Every mouth was agape, every eye fastened on that glinting tooth of\nsteel.\nThe blade flashed down. Its point drove easily through skin and flesh\nuntil it was buried right to the hilt. The point emerged, dripping blood, from\nthe underside of Fenris' own tattooed left arm. His face twitched, but no\nmore than usual. The blade moved grotesquely as he stretched out his\nfingers, raised his left arm high for all to see. The drops of blood made a\nsteady patter on the floor of the Lords' Round.\n'Who will fight me?' he screamed, great cords of sinew bulging from his\nneck. His voice was almost painful to the ear.\nUtter silence. The Announcer, who was closest to the Feared, and\nalready on his knees, swooned and collapsed on his face.\nFenris turned his goggling eyes on the biggest knight before the table, a\nfull head shorter than he was. 'You?' he hissed. The unfortunate man's foot\nscraped on the floor as he backed away, no doubt wishing he had been born\na dwarf.\nA puddle of dark blood had spread across the floor beneath Fenris'\nelbow. 'You?' he snarled at Fedor dan Meed. The young man turned slightly\ngrey, teeth rattling together, no doubt wishing he was someone else's son.\nThose blinking eyes swept across the ashen faces on the high table.\nJezal's throat constricted as Fenris' eyes met his. 'You?'\n'Well I would, but I'm terribly busy this afternoon. Perhaps tomorrow?'\nThe voice hardly sounded like his own. He certainly hadn't meant to say\nany such thing. But who else's could it be? The words floated confidently,\nbreezily up towards the gilded dome above.\nThere was scattered laughter, a shout of 'Bravo!' from somewhere at the\nback, but the eyes of the Feared did not leave Jezal's for an instant. He\nwaited for the sounds to die, then his mouth twisted into a hideous leer.\n'Tomorrow then,' he whispered. Jezal's guts gave a sudden painful shift.\nThe seriousness of the situation pressed itself upon him like a ton of rocks.\nHim? Fight that?"

'No!' barked Hoff again. 'There will be no duel here!\nThere is no issue to decide! Angland is a part of the Union, by ancient law!'\nWhite-Eye Hansul chuckled softly. 'Ancient law? Angland is part of the\nNorth. Two hundred years ago there were Northmen there, living free. You\nwanted iron, so you crossed the sea, and slaughtered them and stole their\nland! It must be, then, that most ancient of laws: that the strong take what\nthey wish from the weak?' His eyes narrowed. 'We have that law also!'\nFenris the Feared ripped the knife from his arm. A few last drops of\nblood spattered onto the tiles, but that was all. There was no wound on the\ntattooed flesh. No mark at all. The knife clattered onto the tiles and lay there\nin the pool of blood at his feet. Fenris swept the assembly with his bulging,\nblinking, crazy eyes one last time, then he turned and strode across the floor\nand up the aisle, Lords and proxies scrambling away down their benches as\nhe approached.\nWhite-Eye Hansul bowed low. 'Perhaps the time will come when you\nwish that you had accepted our offer, or our gift. You will hear from us,' he\nsaid quietly, then he held up three fingers to the Lord Chamberlain. 'When it\nis time, we will send three signs.'\n'Send three hundred if you wish,' barked Hoff, 'but this pantomime is\nover!'\nWhite-Eye Hansul nodded pleasantly. 'You will hear from us.' And he\nturned and followed Fenris the Feared out of the Lords' Round. The great\ndoors clapped shut. The quill of the nearest clerk scratched weakly against\nthe paper.\nYou will hear from us.\nFedor dan Meed turned towards the Lord Chamberlain, jaw locked\ntight, handsome features contorted with fury. 'And this is the good news you\nwould have me convey to my father?' he screamed. The Open Council\nerupted. Bellowing, shouting, abuse directed toward anyone and everyone,\nchaos of the worst kind.\nHoff jumped up, chair toppling over behind him, mouthing angry\nwords, but even he was drowned out by the uproar. Meed turned his back\non him and stormed out. Other delegates from the Angland side of the room\nrose grimly and followed the son of their Lord Governor.

The dawn mist was almost gone, and from the balcony outside Logen's\nroom, high up on the side of one of the towers of the library, you could see\nfor miles. The great valley was spread out before him, split into stark layers.\nOn top was the grey and puffy white of the cloudy sky. Then there was the\nragged line of black crags that ringed the lake, and the dim brown\nsuggestion of others beyond. Next came the dark green of the wooded\nslopes, then the thin, curving line of grey shingle on the beach. All was\nrepeated in the still mirror of the lake below—another, shadowy world,\nupside down beneath his own.\nLogen looked down at his hands, fingers spread out on the weathered\nstone of the parapet. There was no dirt, no dried blood under his cracked\nfingernails. They looked pale, soft, pinkish, strange. Even the scabs and\nscrapes on his knuckles were mostly healed. It was so long since Logen had\nbeen clean that he'd forgotten what it felt like. His new clothes were coarse\nagainst his skin, robbed of its usual covering of dirt and grease and dry\nsweat.\nLooking out at the still lake, clean and well fed, he felt a different man.\nFor a moment he wondered how this new Logen might turn out, but the\nbare stone of the parapet stared back at him where his missing finger used\nto be. That could never heal. He was Ninefingers still, the Bloody-Nine, and\nalways would be. Unless he lost any more fingers. He did smell better\nthough, that had to be admitted.\n'Did you sleep well, Master Ninefingers?' Wells was in the doorway,\npeering out onto the balcony.\n'Like a baby.' Logen didn't have the heart to tell the old servant that he'd\nslept outside. The first night he'd tried the bed, rolling and wriggling, unable\nto come to terms with the strange comfort of a mattress and the unfamiliar\nwarmth of blankets. Next he'd tried the floor. That had been an\nimprovement. But the air had still seemed close, flat, stale. The ceiling had\nhung over him, seeming to creep ever lower, threatening to crush him with\nthe weight of stone above. It was only when he'd lain down on the hard\nflags of the balcony, with his old coat spread over him and just the clouds\nand the stars above, that sleep had come. Some habits are hard to break.\n'You have a visitor,' said Wells.\n'Me?'\nMalacus Quai's head appeared around the door frame. His eyes were a\nlittle less sunken, the bags underneath them a little less dark. There was\nsome colour to his skin, and some flesh on his bones. He no longer looked\nlike a corpse, just gaunt and sick, as he had done when Logen first met him.\nHe guessed that was about as healthy as Quai ever looked.\n'Hah!' laughed Logen. 'You survived!'\nThe apprentice gave a series of tired nods as he shambled across the\nroom.

He shuffled out of the door to the\nbalcony and stood there, sniffing and blinking in the chill morning air.\nLogen was more pleased to see him than he'd expected. He clapped him\non the back like an old friend, perhaps a little too warmly. The apprentice\nstumbled, blanket tangled round his feet, and would have fallen if Logen\nhadn't put out an arm to steady him.\n'Still not quite in fighting shape,' muttered Quai, with a weak grin.\n'You look a deal better than when I last saw you.'\n'So do you. You lost the beard I see, and the smell too. A few less scars\nand you'd look almost civilised.'\nLogen held his hands up. 'Anything but that.'\nWells ducked through the doorway into the bright morning light. He had\na roll of cloth and a knife in his hand. 'Could I see your arm, Master\nNinefingers?'\nLogen had almost forgotten about the cut. There was no new blood on\nthe bandage, and when he unwound it there was a long, red-brown scab\nunderneath, running almost all the way from wrist to elbow, surrounded by\nfresh pink skin. It hardly hurt any more, just itched. It crossed two other,\nolder scars. One, a jagged grey effort near his wrist, he thought he might\nhave got in the duel with Threetrees, all those years ago. Logen grimaced as\nhe remembered the battering they'd given each other. The second scar,\nfainter, higher up, he wasn't sure about. Could've come from anywhere.\nWells bent down and tested the flesh round the wound while Quai\npeered cautiously over his shoulder. 'It's mending well. You're a fast healer.'\n'Lots of practice.'\nWells looked up at Logen's face, where the cut on his forehead had\nalready faded to one more pink line. 'I can see. Would it be foolish to advise\nyou to avoid sharp objects in the future?'\nLogen laughed. 'Believe it or not, I always did my best to avoid them in\nthe past. But they seem to seek me out, despite my efforts.'\n'Well,' said the old servant, cutting off a fresh length of cloth and\nwinding it carefully round Logen's forearm, 'I hope this is the last bandage\nyou ever need.'\n'So do I,' said Logen, flexing his fingers. 'So do I.' But he didn't think it\nwould be.\n'Breakfast will be ready soon.' And Wells left the two of them alone on\nthe balcony.\nThey stood there in silence for a moment, then the wind blew up cold\nfrom the valley. Quai shivered and pulled his blanket tight around him. 'Out\nthere… by the lake. You could have left me. I would have left me.'\nLogen frowned. Time was he'd have done it and never given it a second\nthought, but things change. 'I've left a lot of people, in my time. Reckon I'm\nsick of that feeling.'\nThe apprentice pursed his lips and looked out at the valley, the woods,\nthe distant mountains. 'I never saw a man killed before.'\n'You're lucky.'"

'I never saw a man killed before.'\n'You're lucky.'\n'You've seen a lot of death, then?'\nLogen winced. In his youth, he would have loved to answer that very\nquestion. He could have bragged, and boasted, and listed the actions he'd\nbeen in, the Named Men he'd killed. He couldn't say now when the pride\nhad dried up. It had happened slowly. As the wars became bloodier, as the\ncauses became excuses, as the friends went back to the mud, one by one.\nLogen rubbed at his ear, felt the big notch that Tul Duru's sword had made,\nlong ago. He could have stayed silent. But for some reason, he felt the need\nto be honest.\n'I've fought in three campaigns,' he began. 'In seven pitched battles. In\ncountless raids and skirmishes and desperate defences, and bloody actions\nof every kind. I've fought in the driving snow, the blasting wind, the middle\nof the night. I've been fighting all my life, one enemy or another, one friend\nor another. I've known little else. I've seen men killed for a word, for a look,\nfor nothing at all. A woman tried to stab me once for killing her husband,\nand I threw her down a well. And that's far from the worst of it. Life used to\nbe cheap as dirt to me. Cheaper.\n'I've fought ten single combats and I won them all, but I fought on the\nwrong side and for all the wrong reasons. I've been ruthless, and brutal, and\na coward. I've stabbed men in the back, burned them, drowned them,\ncrushed them with rocks, killed them asleep, unarmed, or running away. I've\nrun away myself more than once. I've pissed myself with fear. I've begged\nfor my life. I've been wounded, often, and badly, and screamed and cried\nlike a baby whose mother took her tit away. I've no doubt the world would\nbe a better place if I'd been killed years ago, but I haven't been, and I don't\nknow why.'\nHe looked down at his hands, pink and clean on the stone. 'There are\nfew men with more blood on their hands than me. None, that I know of. The\nBloody-Nine they call me, my enemies, and there's a lot of 'em. Always\nmore enemies, and fewer friends. Blood gets you nothing but more blood. It\nfollows me now, always, like my shadow, and like my shadow I can never\nbe free of it. I should never be free of it. I've earned it. I've deserved it. I've\nsought it out. Such is my punishment.'\nAnd that was all. Logen breathed a deep, ragged sigh and stared out at\nthe lake. He couldn't bring himself to look at the man beside him, didn't\nwant to see the expression on his face. Who wants to learn he's keeping\ncompany with the Bloody-Nine? A man who's wrought more death than the\nplague, and with less regret. They could never be friends now, not with all\nthose corpses between them.\nThen he felt Quai's hand clap him on the shoulder. 'Well, there it is,' he"

And\nthey both laughed for a while, and it felt good.\n'So, Malacus, I see you are back with us.'\nThey turned, Quai stumbling on his blanket and looking a touch sick.\nThe First of the Magi was standing in the doorway, dressed in a long white\nshirt with sleeves rolled up to the elbow. He still looked more like a butcher\nthan a wizard to Logen.\n'Master Bayaz… er… I was just coming to see you,' stuttered Quai.\n'Indeed? How fortunate for us both then, that I have come to you.' The\nMagus stepped out onto the balcony. 'It occurs to me that a man who is well\nenough to talk, and laugh, and venture out of doors, is doubtless well\nenough to read, and study, and expand his tiny mind. What would you say\nto that?'\n'Doubtless…'\n'Doubtless, yes! Tell me, how are your studies progressing?'\nThe wretched apprentice looked utterly confused. 'They have been\nsomewhat… interrupted?'\n'You made no progress with Juvens' Principles of Art while you were\nlost in the hills in bad weather?'\n'Er… no progress… no.'\n'And your knowledge of the histories. Did that develop far, while\nMaster Ninefingers was carrying you back to the library?'\n'Er… I must confess… it didn't.'\n'Your exercises and meditations though, surely you have been practising\nthose, while unconscious this past week?'\n'Well, er… no, the unconsciousness was… er…'\n'So, tell me, would you say that you are ahead of the game, so to speak?\nOr have your studies fallen behind?'\nQuai stared down at the floor. 'They were behind when I left.'\n'Then perhaps then you could tell me where you plan to spend the day?'\nThe apprentice looked up hopefully. 'At my desk?'\n'Excellent!' Bayaz smiled wide. 'I was about to suggest it, but you have\nanticipated me! Your keenness to learn does you much credit!' Quai nodded\nfuriously and hurried towards the door, the hem of his blanket trailing on\nthe flags.\n'Bethod is coming,' murmured Bayaz. 'He will be here today.' Logen's\nsmile vanished, his throat felt suddenly tight. He remembered their last\nmeeting well enough. Stretched out on his face on the floor of Bethod's hall\nat Carleon, beaten and broken and well chained up, dribbling blood into the\nstraw and hoping the end wouldn't be too long coming. Then, no reason\ngiven, they'd let him go. Flung him out the gates with the Dogman,\nThreetrees, the Weakest and the rest, and told him never to come back.\nNever. The first time Bethod ever showed a grain of mercy, and the last,\nLogen didn't doubt.\n'Today?' he asked, trying to keep his voice even."

The King of the Northmen. Hah! The arrogance of him!'\nBayaz glanced sidelong at Logen. 'He is coming to ask me for a favour, and\nI would like you to be there.'\n'He won't like that.'\n'Exactly.'\nThe wind felt colder than before. If Logen never saw Bethod again it\nwould be far too soon. But some things have to be done. It's better to do\nthem, than to live with the fear of them. That's what Logen's father would\nhave said. So he took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. 'I'll be there.'\n'Excellent. Then there is but one thing missing.'\n'What?'\nBayaz smirked. 'You need a weapon.'\nIt was dry in the cellars beneath the library. Dry and dark and very, very\nconfusing. They'd gone up and down steps, around corners, past doors,\ntaking here or there a turning to the left or right. The place was a warren.\nLogen hoped he didn't lose sight of the wizard's flickering torch, or he could\neasily be stuck beneath the library for ever.\n'Dry down here, nice and dry,' Bayaz was saying to himself, voice\nechoing down the passageway and merging with their flapping footfalls.\n'There's nothing worse than damp for books.' He pulled up suddenly next to\na heavy door. 'Or for weapons.' He gave the door a gentle shove and it\nswung silently open.\n'Look at that! Hasn't been opened for years, but the hinges still move\nsmooth as butter! That's craftsmanship for you! Why does no one care about\ncraftsmanship anymore?' Bayaz stepped over the threshold without waiting\nfor an answer, and Logen followed close behind.\nThe wizard's torch lit up a long, low hall with walls of rough stone\nblocks, the far end lost in shadows. The room was lined with racks and\nshelves, the floor littered with boxes and stands, everything heaped and\nbursting with a mad array of arms and armour. Blades and spikes and\npolished surfaces of wood and metal caught the flickering torchlight as\nBayaz paced slowly across the stone floor, weaving between the weapons\nand casting around.\n'Quite a collection,' muttered Logen, as he followed the Magus through\nthe clutter.\n'A load of old junk mostly, but there should be a few things worth the\nfinding.' Bayaz took a helmet from a suit of ancient, gilded plate armour\nand looked it over with a frown. 'What do you make of that?'\n'I've never been much for armour.'\n'No, you don't strike me as the type. All very well on horseback, I dare\nsay, but it's a pain in the arse when you've a journey to make on foot.' He\ntossed the helmet back onto its stand, then stood there staring at the armour,\nlost in thought. 'Once you've got it on, how do you piss?'\nLogen frowned. 'Er…' he said, but Bayaz was already moving off down\nthe room, and taking the light with him."

'Er…' he said, but Bayaz was already moving off down\nthe room, and taking the light with him.\n'You must have used a few weapons in your time, Master Ninefingers.\nWhat's your preference for?'\n'I've never really had one,' said Logen, ducking under a rusty halberd\nleaning out from a rack. 'A champion never knows what he might be called\non to fight with.'\n'Of course, of course.' Bayaz took up a long spear with a vicious barbed\nhead, and wafted it around a bit. Logen stepped back cautiously. 'Deadly\nenough. You could keep a man at bay with one of these. But a man with a\nspear needs a lot of friends, and they all need spears as well.' Bayaz shoved\nit back on the rack and moved on.\n'This looks fearsome.' The Magus took hold of the gnarled shaft of a\nhuge double-bladed axe. 'Shit!' he said as he lifted it up, veins bulging out\nof his neck. 'It's heavy enough!' He set it down with a thump, making the\nrack wobble. 'You could kill a man with that! You could cut him clean in\nhalf! If he was standing still.'\n'This is better,' said Logen. It was a simple, solid-looking sword, in a\nscabbard of weathered brown leather.\n'Oh, yes indeed. Much, much better. That blade is the work of Kanedias,\nthe Master Maker himself.' Bayaz handed his torch to Logen and took the\nlong sword from the rack.\n'Has it ever occurred to you, Master Ninefingers, that a sword is\ndifferent from other weapons? Axes and maces and so forth are lethal\nenough, but they hang on the belt like dumb brutes.' He ran an eye over the\nhilt, plain cold metal scored with faint grooves for a good grip, glinting in\nthe torchlight. 'But a sword… a sword has a voice.'\n'Eh?'\n'Sheathed it has little to say, to be sure, but you need only put your hand\non the hilt and it begins to whisper in your enemy's ear.' He wrapped his\nfingers tightly round the grip. 'A gentle warning. A word of caution. Do you\nhear it?'\nLogen nodded slowly. 'Now,' murmured Bayaz, 'compare it to the sword\nhalf drawn.' A foot length of metal hissed out of the sheath, a single silver\nletter shining near the hilt. The blade itself was dull, but its edge had a cold\nand frosty glint. 'It speaks louder, does it not? It hisses a dire threat. It\nmakes a deadly promise. Do you hear it?'\nLogen nodded again, his eye fastened on that glittering edge. 'Now\ncompare it to the sword full drawn.' Bayaz whipped the long blade from its\nsheath with a faint ringing sound, brought it up so that the point hovered\ninches from Logen's face. 'It shouts now, does it not? It screams defiance! It\nbellows a challenge! Do you hear it?'\n'Mmm,' said Logen, leaning back and staring slightly crosseyed at the\nshining point of the sword."

Do you hear it?'\n'Mmm,' said Logen, leaning back and staring slightly crosseyed at the\nshining point of the sword.\nBayaz let it drop and slid it gently back into its scabbard, something to\nLogen's relief. 'Yes, a sword has a voice. Axes and maces and so forth are\nlethal enough, but a sword is a subtle weapon, and suited to a subtle man.\nYou I think, Master Ninefingers, are subtler than you appear.' Logen\nfrowned as Bayaz held the sword out to him. He had been accused of many\nthings in his life, but never subtlety. 'Consider it a gift. My thanks for your\ngood manners.'\nLogen thought about it a moment. He hadn't owned a proper weapon\nsince before he crossed the mountains, and he wasn't keen to take one up\nagain. But Bethod was coming, and soon. Better to have it, and not want it,\nthan to want it, and not have it. Far, far better. You have to be realistic about\nthese things.\n'Thank you,' said Logen, taking the sword from Bayaz and handing him\nback the torch. 'I think.'\nA small fire crackled in the grate, and the room was warm, and homely, and\ncomfortable.\nBut Logen didn't feel comfortable. He stood by the window, staring\ndown into the courtyard below, nervous and twitchy and scared, like he\nused to be before a fight. Bethod was coming. He was somewhere out there.\nOn the road through the woods, or passing between the stones, or across the\nbridge, or through the gate.\nThe First of the Magi didn't seem tense. He sat comfortably in his chair,\nhis feet up on the table next to a long wooden pipe, leafing through a small\nwhite-bound book with a faint smile on his face. No one had ever looked\ncalmer, and that only made Logen feel worse.\n'Is it good?' asked Logen.\n'Is what good?'\n'The book.'\n'Oh yes. It is the best of books. It is Juvens' Principles of Art, the very\ncornerstone of my order.' Bayaz waved his free hand at the shelves which\ncovered two walls, and the hundreds of other identical books lined neatly\nupon them. 'It's all the same. One book.'\n'One?' Logen's eyes scanned across the thick, white spines. 'That's a\npretty damn long book. Have you read it all?'\nBayaz chuckled. 'Oh yes, many times. Every one of my order must read\nit, and eventually make their own copy' He turned the book around, so that\nLogen could see. The pages were thickly covered with lines of neat, but\nunintelligible symbols. 'I wrote these, long ago. You should read it too.'\n'I'm really not much of a reader.'\n'No?' asked Bayaz. 'Shame.' He flicked over the page and carried on.\n'What about that one?' There was another book, sat alone on its side on\nthe very top of one of the shelves, a large, black book, scarred and battered-\nlooking. 'That written by this Juvens as well?'\nBayaz frowned up at it. 'No. His brother wrote that.' He got up from his"

'This is a different kind of\nknowledge.' He dragged open his desk drawer, slid the black book inside\nand slammed it shut. 'Best left alone,' he muttered, sitting back down and\nopening up the Principles of Art again.\nLogen took a deep breath, put his left hand on the hilt of the sword, felt\nthe cold metal pressing into his palm. The feel of it was anything but\nreassuring. He let go and turned back to the window, frowning down into\nthe courtyard. He felt his breath catch in his throat.\n'Bethod. He's here.'\n'Good, good,' muttered Bayaz absently. 'Who does he have with him?'\nLogen peered at the three figures in the courtyard. 'Scale,' he said with a\nscowl. 'And a woman. I don't recognise her. They're dismounting.' Logen\nlicked his dry lips. 'They're coming in.'\n'Yes, yes,' murmured Bayaz, 'that is how one gets to a meeting. Try to\ncalm yourself, my friend. Breathe.'\nLogen leaned back against the whitewashed plaster, arms folded, and\ntook a deep breath. It didn't help. The hard knot of worry in his chest only\npressed harder. He could hear heavy footsteps in the corridor outside. The\ndoorknob turned.\nScale was the first into the room. Bethod's eldest son had always been\nburly, even as a boy, but since Logen last saw him he'd grown monstrous.\nHis rock of a head seemed almost an afterthought on top of all that brawn,\nhis skull a good deal narrower than his neck. He had a great block of jaw, a\nflat stub of a nose, and furious, bulging, arrogant little eyes. His thin mouth\nwas twisted in a constant sneer, much like his younger brother Calder's, but\nthere was less guile here and a lot more violence. He had a heavy\nbroadsword on his hip, and his meaty hand was never far from it as he\nglowered at Logen, oozing malice from every pore.\nThe woman came next. She was very tall, slender and pale, almost ill-\nlooking. Her slanting eyes were as narrow and cold as Scale's were bulging\nand wrathful, and were surrounded with a quantity of dark paint, which\nmade them look narrower and colder still. There were golden rings on her\nlong fingers, golden bracelets on her thin arms, golden chains around her\nwhite neck. She swept the room with her frosty blue eyes, each thing she\nnoticed seeming to lift her to new heights of disgust and contempt. First the\nfurniture, then the books, particularly Logen, and Bayaz most of all.\nThe self-styled King of the Northmen came last, and more magnificent\nthan ever, robed in rich, coloured cloth and rare white furs. He wore a heavy\ngolden chain across his shoulders, a golden circlet round his head, set with a\nsingle diamond, big as a bird's egg.

His smiling face was more deeply lined\nthan Logen remembered, his hair and beard touched with grey, but he was\nno less tall, no less vigorous, no less handsome, and he'd gained much of\nauthority and wisdom—of majesty even. He looked every inch a great man,\na wise man, a just man. He looked every inch a King. But Logen knew\nbetter.\n'Bethod!' said Bayaz, warmly, snapping his book shut. 'My old friend!\nYou can hardly imagine what a joy it is to see you again.' He swung his feet\noff the table, and gestured at the golden chain, the flashing diamond. 'And\nto see you so hugely advanced in the world! I remember the time was you\nwere happy to visit me alone. But I suppose great men must be attended on,\nand I see you have brought some… other people. Your charming son I\nknow, of course. I see that you've been eating well at least, eh, Scale?'\n'Prince Scale,' rumbled Bethod's monstrous son, his eyes popping out\neven more.\n'Hmm,' said Bayaz, with an eyebrow raised. 'I have not had the pleasure\nof meeting your other companion before.'\n'I am Caurib.' Logen blinked. The woman's voice was the most beautiful\nthing he'd ever heard. Calming, soothing, intoxicating. 'I am a sorceress,'\nshe sang, tossing her head with a scornful smile. 'A sorceress, from the\nutmost north.' Logen stood frozen, his mouth half open. His hatred seeped\naway. They were all friends here. More than friends. He couldn't take his\neyes from her, didn't want to. The others in the room had faded. It was as if\nshe was speaking only to him, and the fondest wish of his heart was that she\nshould never stop—\nBut Bayaz only laughed. 'A real sorceress, and you have the golden\nvoice! How wonderful! It's a long time since I heard that one, but it will not\nserve you here.' Logen shook his head clear and his hatred rushed back in,\nhot and reassuring. 'Tell me, does one have to study, to become a sorceress?\nOr is it simply a question of jewellery, and a deal of paint about the face?'\nCaurib's eyes narrowed to deadly blue slits, but the First of the Magi didn't\ngive her time to speak. 'And from the utmost north, imagine that!' He\nshivered slightly. 'It must be cold up there, this time of year. Rough on the\nnipples, eh? Have you come to us for the warm weather, or is there\nsomething else?'\n'I go where my King commands,' she hissed, pointed chin lifting a little\nhigher.\n'Your King?' asked Bayaz, staring about the room as though there must\nbe someone else there, hiding in the corner.\n'My father is King of the Northmen now!' snarled Scale. He sneered at\nLogen. 'You should kneel to him, Bloody-Nine!' He sneered at Bayaz. 'And\nso should you, old man!'\nThe First of the Magi spread his hands in apology. 'Oh I'm afraid I don't\nkneel to anyone. Too old for it. Stiffness in the joints, you see.'"

His voice was cold\nand even as freshly fallen snow. 'It is not fitting that we bicker. Are our\ninterests not the same? Peace? Peace in the North? I have come only to ask\nfor your wisdom, Bayaz, as I did in days past. Is it so wrong, to seek the\nhelp of an old friend?' No one had ever sounded more genuine, more\nreasonable, more trustworthy. But Logen knew better.\n'But do we not have peace in the North already?' Bayaz leaned back in\nhis chair, hands clasped before him. 'Are the feuds not all ended? Were you\nnot the victor? Do you not have everything you wanted, and more? King of\nthe Northmen, eh? What help could I possibly offer you?'\n'I only share my counsel with friends, Bayaz, and you have been no\nfriend to me of late. You turn away my messengers, my son even. You play\nhost to my sworn enemies.' He frowned towards Logen, and his lip curled.\n'Do you know what manner of thing this is? The Bloody-Nine? An animal!\nA coward! An oath-breaker! Is that the kind of company that you prefer?'\nBethod smiled a friendly smile as he turned back to Bayaz, but there\nwas no missing the threat in his words. 'I fear the time has come for you to\ndecide whether you are with me, or against me. There can be no middle\nground in this. Either you are a part of my future, or a relic of the past.\nYours is the choice, my friend.' Logen had seen Bethod give such choices\nbefore. Some men had yielded. The rest had gone back to the mud.\nBut Bayaz, it seemed, was not to be rushed. 'Which shall it be?' He\nreached forward slowly and took his pipe from the table. 'The future, or the\npast?' He strolled over to the fire and squatted down, back turned to his\nthree guests, took a stick from the grate, set it to the bowl, and puffed\nslowly away. It seemed to take an age for him to get the damn thing lit.\n'With, or against?' he mused as he returned to his chair.\n'Well?' demanded Bethod.\nBayaz stared up at the ceiling and blew out a thin stream of yellow\nsmoke. Caurib looked the old Magus up and down with icy contempt, Scale\ntwitched with impatience, Bethod waited, eyes a little narrowed. Finally,\nBayaz gave a heavy sigh. 'Very well. I am with you.'\nBethod smiled wide, and Logen felt a lurch of terrible disappointment.\nHe had hoped for better from the First of the Magi.

They hate each other and they hate you, am I right?'\n'Well,' smiled Bethod, 'they are somewhat restive.'\n'I bet they are! But send them to war with the Union, then they will be a\nnation, eh?

'You presume too much.'\n'But you—'\n'Oh, that.' The Magus shrugged. 'I am a liar.'\nBayaz lifted his pipe to his mouth. There was a moment of stunned\nsilence. Then Bethod's eyes narrowed. Caurib's widened. Scale's heavy\nbrow crinkled with confusion. Logen's smile slowly returned.\n'A liar?' hissed the sorceress. 'And more besides, say I!' Her voice still\nhad the singing note about it, but it was a different song now—hard, shrill,\nmurderous sharp. 'You old worm! Hiding here behind your walls, and your\nservants, and your books! Your time is long past, fool! You are nothing but\nwords and dust!' The First of the Magi calmly pursed his lips and blew out\nsmoke. 'Words and dust, old worm! Well, we shall see.

'We will come back to your library,\nand put your walls to the hammer, your servants to the sword, and your\nbooks to the fire! To the—'\n'Silence.' Bayaz was frowning now, deeper even than he had at Calder,\ndays before in the yard outside. Again Logen felt the desire to step away,\nbut stronger by far. He found himself glancing around the room for a place\nto hide. Caurib's lips still moved, but only a meaningless croak came out.\n'Break my walls, would you?' murmured Bayaz. His grey brows drew\ninwards, deep, hard grooves cutting into the bridge of his nose.\n'Kill my servants, will you?' asked Bayaz. The room had turned very\nchill, despite the logs on the fire."

The room had turned very\nchill, despite the logs on the fire.\n'Burn my books, say you?' thundered Bayaz. 'You say too much, witch!'\nCaurib's knees buckled. Her white hand clawed at the door-frame, chains\nand bangles jingling together as she slumped against the wall.\n'Words and dust, am I?' Bayaz thrust up four fingers. 'Four gifts you had\nof me, Bethod—the sun in winter, a storm in summer, and two things you\ncould never have known, but for my Art. What have you given me in return,\neh? This lake and this valley, which were mine already, and but one other\nthing.' Bethod's eyes flicked across to Logen, then back. 'You owe me still,\nyet you send messengers to me, you make demands, you presume to\ncommand me? That is not my idea of manners.'\nScale had caught up now, and his eyes were near popping out of his\nhead. 'Manners? What does a King need with manners? A King takes what\nhe wants!' And he took a heavy step towards the table.\nNow Scale was big enough and cruel enough, to be sure. Most likely\nyou could never find a better man for kicking someone once he was down.\nBut Logen wasn't down, not yet, and he was good and sick of listening to\nthis bloated fool. He stepped forward to block Scale's path, resting his hand\non the hilt of his sword. 'Far enough.'\nThe Prince looked Logen over with his bulging eyes, held up his meaty\nfist, squeezing his great fingers so the knuckles turned white. 'Don't tempt\nme Ninefingers, you broken cur! Your day's long past! I could crush you\nlike an egg!'\n'You can try it, but I've no mind to let you. You know my work. One\nstep more and I'll set to work on you, you fucking swollen pig.'\n'Scale!' snapped Bethod. 'There is nothing for us here, that much is\nplain. We are leaving.' The hulking prince locked his great lump of a jaw,\nhis huge hands clenching and unclenching by his sides, glowering at Logen\nwith the most bestial hatred imaginable. Then he sneered, and slowly\nbacked away.\nBayaz leaned forward. 'You said you would bring peace to the North,\nBethod, and what have you done? You have piled war on war! The land is\nbled white with your pride and your brutality! King of the Northmen? Hah!\nYou're not worth the helping! And to think, I had such high hopes for you!'\nBethod only frowned, his eyes as cold as the diamond on his forehead.\n'You have made an enemy of me, Bayaz, and I am a bad enemy to have. The\nvery worst. You will yet regret this day's work.' He turned his scorn on\nLogen. 'As for you, Ninefingers, you will have no more mercy from me!\nEvery man in the North will be your enemy now! You will be hated, and\nhunted, and cursed, wherever you go! I will see to it!'"

Bayaz stood up from his\nchair. 'You've said your piece, now take your witch and get you gone!'\nCaurib stumbled from the room first, still gasping for air. Scale\ngave Logen one last scowl, then he turned and lumbered away. I he so-\ncalled King of the Northmen was the last to leave, nodding slowly and\nsweeping the room with a deadly glare. As their footsteps faded down the\ncorridor Logen took a deep breath, steadied himself, and let his hand drop\nfrom the hilt of the sword.\n'So,' said Bayaz brightly, 'that went well.'\nA Road Between Two Dentists\n« ^ »\nPast midnight, and it was dark in the Middleway. Dark and it smelled bad. It\nalways smelled bad down by the docks: old salt water, rotten fish, tar and\nsweat and horse shit. In a few hours time this street would be thronging\nwith noise and activity. Tradesmen shouting, labourers cursing under their\nloads, merchants hurrying to and fro, a hundred carts and wagons rumbling\nover the dirty cobbles. There would be an endless tide of people, thronging\noff the ships and thronging on, people from every part of the world, words\nshouted in every language under the sun. But at night it was still. Still and\nsilent. Silent as the grave, and even worse smelling.\n'It's down here,' said Severard, strolling towards the shadowy mouth of a\nnarrow alley, wedged in between two looming warehouses.\n'Did he give you much trouble?' asked Glokta as he shuffled painfully\nafter.\n'Not too much.' The Practical adjusted his mask, letting some air in\nbehind. Must get very clammy under there, all that breath and sweat. No\nwonder Practicals tend to have bad tempers. 'He gave Rews' mattress some\ntrouble, stabbed it all to bits. Then Frost knocked him on the head. Funny\nthing. When that boy knocks a man on the head, the trouble all goes out of\nhim.'\n'What about Rews?'\n'Still alive.' The light from Severard's lamp passed over a pile of putrid\nrubbish. Glokta heard rats squeaking in the darkness as they scurried away.\n'You know all the best neighbourhoods, don't you Severard?'\n'That's what you pay me for, Inquisitor.' His dirty black boot squelched,\nheedless, into the stinking mush. Glokta limped gingerly around it, holding\nthe hem of his coat up in his free hand. 'I grew up round here,' continued the\nPractical. 'Folk don't ask questions'\n'Except for us.' We always have questions.\n'Course.' Severard gave a muffled giggle. 'We're the Inquisition.'\nHis lamp picked out a dented iron gate, the high wall above topped with\nrusty spikes. 'This is it.' Indeed, and what an auspicious-looking address it\nis. The gate evidently didn't see much use, its brown hinges squealed in"

The gate evidently didn't see much use, its brown hinges squealed in\nprotest as the Practical unlocked it and heaved it open. Glokta stepped\nawkwardly over a puddle that had built up in a rut in the ground, cursing as\nhis coat trailed in the foul water.\nThe hinges screamed again as Severard wrestled the heavy gate shut,\nforehead creasing with the effort, then he lifted the hood on his lantern,\nlighting up a wide ornamental courtyard, choked with rubble and weeds and\nbroken wood.\n'And here we are,' said Severard.\nIt must once have been a magnificent building, in its way. How much\nwould all those windows have cost? How much all that decorative\nstonework? Visitors must have been awed by its owners wealth, if not his\ngood taste. But no more. The windows were blinded with rotting boards,\nthe swirls of masonry were choked with moss and caked with bird\ndroppings. The thin layer of green marble on the pillars was cracked and\nflaking, exposing the rotten plaster underneath. All was crumbled, broken\nand decayed. Fallen lumps of the façade were strewn everywhere, casting\nlong shadows on the high walls of the yard. Half the head of a broken\ncherub stared mournfully up at Glokta as he limped past.\nHe had been expecting some dingy warehouse, some dank cellar near\nthe water. 'What is this place?' he asked, staring up at the rotting palace.\n'Some merchant built it, years ago.' Severard kicked a lump of broken\nsculpture out of his way and it clattered off into the darkness. 'A rich man,\nvery rich. Wanted to live near his warehouses and his wharves, keep one\neye on business.' He strolled up the cracked and mossy steps to the huge,\nflaking front door. 'He thought the idea might catch on, but how could it?\nWho'd want to live round here if they didn't have to? Then he lost all his\nmoney, as merchants do. His creditors have had trouble finding a buyer.'\nGlokta stared at a broken fountain, leaning at an angle and half filled\nwith stagnant water. 'Hardly surprising.'\nSeverard's lamp barely lit the cavernous space of the entrance lull. Two\nenormous, curved, slumping staircases loomed out of the gloom opposite\nthem. A wide balcony ran around the walls at first floor level, but a great\nsection of it had collapsed and crashed through the damp floorboards below,\nso that one of the stairways ended, amputated, hanging in the empty air. The\ndamp floor was strewn with lumps of broken plaster, fallen roofing slates,\nshattered timbers and a spattering of grey bird droppings. The night sky\npeered in through several yawning holes in the roof. Glokta could hear the\nvague sound of pigeons cooing in amongst the shadowy rafters, and\nsomewhere the slow dripping of water.\nWhat a place. Glokta stifled a smile. It reminds me of myself, in a way.\nWe both were magnificent once, and we both have our best days far behind\nus.\n'It's big enough, wouldn't you say?' asked Severard, picking his way in"

Glokta shuffled after him, leaning heavily on his cane, worried\nabout his footing on the slimy floor. I'll slip and fall right on my arse, right\nhere in all this bird shit. That would be perfect.\nThe arch opened into a crumbling hall, rotten plaster falling away in\nsheets, showing the damp bricks beneath. Gloomy doorways passed by on\neither side. The sort of place that would make a man nervous, if he was\nprone to nervousness. He might imagine unpleasant things in these\nchambers, just beyond the lamp light, and horrible acts taking place in the\ndarkness. He looked up at Severard, ambling jauntily along in front,\ntuneless whistling vaguely audible from behind his mask, and frowned. But\nwe are not prone to nervousness. Perhaps we are the unpleasant things.\nPerhaps the acts are ours.\n'How big is this place?' asked Glokta as he hobbled along.\n'Thirty-five rooms, not counting the servant's quarters.'\n'A palace. How the hell did you find it?'\n'I used to sleep here, some nights. After my mother died. I found a way\nin. The roof was still mostly on back then, and it was a dry place to sleep.\nDry and safe. More or less.' Ah, what a hard life it's been. Thug and torturer\nis a real step up for you, isn't it? Every man has his excuses, and the more\nvile the man becomes, the more touching the story has to be. What is my\nstory now, I wonder?\n'Ever resourceful, eh, Severard?'\n'That's what you pay me for, Inquisitor.'\nThey passed into a wide space: a drawing room, a study, a ball-room\neven, it was big enough. Once beautiful panels were sagging from the walls,\ncovered in mould and flaking gilt paint. Severard moved over to one, still\nattached, and pushed it firmly at one side. There was a soft click as it swung\nopen, revealing a dark archway beyond. A hidden door? How delightful.\nHow sinister. How very appropriate.\n'This place is as full of surprises as you are,' said Glokta, limping\npainfully towards the opening.\n'And you wouldn't believe the price I got.'\n'We bought this?'\n'Oh no. I did. With Rews' money. And now I'm renting it to you.'\nSeverard's eyes sparkled in the lamplight. 'It's a gold mine!'\n'Hah!' laughed Glokta, as he shuffled carefully down the steps. All this,\nand a head for business too. Perhaps I'll be working for Arch Lector\nSeverard one of these days. Stranger things have happened. Glokta's\nshadow loomed out ahead of him into the darkness as he laboured crab-like\ndown the steps, his right hand feeling out the gaps between the rough stone\nblocks to lend him some support."

'We have\nour own private access to the canals, and to the sewers too, if you're\ninterested in sewers.' They passed a dark opening on their left, then another\non their right, always going slowly downwards. 'Frost tells me you can get\nall the way from here to the Agriont, without once coming up for air.'\n'That could be useful.'\n'I'd say so, if you can stand the smell.'\nSeverard's lamp found a heavy door with a small, barred opening.\n'Home again,' he said, and gave four quick knocks. A moment later Practical\nFrost's masked face loomed abruptly out of the darkness at the little\nwindow. 'Only us.' The albino's eyes showed no sign of warmth or\nrecognition. But then they never do. Heavy bolts slid back on the other side\nof the door, and it swung smoothly open.\nThere was a table and chair, and fresh torches on the walls, but they\nwere unlit. It must have been pitch black in here until our little lamp\narrived. Glokta looked over at the albino. 'Have you just been sitting here in\nthe dark?' The hulking Practical shrugged, and Glokta shook his head.\n'Sometimes I worry about you, Practical Frost, I really do.'\n'He's down here,' said Severard, ambling off down the hall, heels\nmaking clicking echoes on the stone flags of the floor. This must once have\nbeen a wine cellar: there were several barrel-vaulted chambers leading off\nto either side, sealed with heavy gratings.\n'Glokta!' Salem Rews' fingers were gripped tightly round the bars, his\nface pressed up between them.\nGlokta stopped in front of the cell and rested his throbbing leg. 'Rews,\nhow are you? I hardly expected to see you again so soon.' He had lost\nweight already, his skin was slack and pale, still marked with fading\nbruises. He does not look well, not well at all.\n'What's happening. Glokta? Please, why am I here?'\nWell, where's the harm? 'It seems the Arch Lector still has a use for you.\nHe wants you to give evidence.' Glokta leaned towards the bars. 'Before the\nOpen Council,' he whispered.\nRews grew paler still. 'Then what?'\n'We'll see.' Angland, Rews, Angland.\n'What if I refuse?'\n'Refuse the Arch Lector?' Glokta chuckled. 'No, no, no, Rews. You don't\nwant to do a thing like that.' He turned away and shuffled after Severard.\n'For pity's sake! It's dark down here!'\n'You'll get used to it!' Glokta called over his shoulder. Amazing, what\none can get used to.\nThe last of the chambers held their latest prisoner. Chained up to a\nbracket in the wall, naked and bagged of course. He was short and stocky,\ntending slightly to fat, with fresh grazes on his knees, no doubt from being\nflung into the rough stone cell."

He was short and stocky,\ntending slightly to fat, with fresh grazes on his knees, no doubt from being\nflung into the rough stone cell.\n'So this is our killer, eh?' The man rolled himself up onto his knees\nwhen he heard Glokta's voice, straining forward against his chains. A little\nblood had soaked through the front of the bag and dried there, making a\nbrown stain on the canvas.\n'A very unsavoury character indeed,' said Severard. 'Doesn't look too\nfearsome now, though, does he?'\n'They never do, once they're brought to this. Where do we work?'\nSeverard's eyes smiled even more. 'Oh, you're going to like this,\nInquisitor.'\n'It's a touch theatrical,' said Glokta, 'but none the worse for that.'\nThe room was large and circular with a domed ceiling, painted with a\ncurious mural that ran all the way round the curved walls. The body of a\nman lay on the grass, bleeding from many wounds, with a forest behind\nhim. Eleven other figures walked away, six on one side, five on the other,\npainted in profile, awkwardly posed, dressed in white but their features\nindistinct. They faced another man, arms stretched out, all in black and with\na sea of colourfully daubed fire behind him. The harsh light from six bright\nlamps didn't make the work look any better. Hardly of the highest quality,\nmore decoration than art, but the effect is quite striking, nonetheless.\n'No idea what it's supposed to be,' said Severard.\n'The Mather Ma'er,' mumbled Practical Frost.\n'Of course,' said Glokta, staring up at the dark figure on the wall, and\nthe flames behind. 'You should study your history, Practical Severard. This\nis the Master Maker, Kanedias.' He turned and pointed to the dying man on\nthe opposite wall. 'And this is great Juvens, whom he has killed.' He swept\nhis hand over the figures in white. 'And these are Juvens' apprentices, the\nMagi, marching to avenge him.' Ghost stories, fit to scare children with.\n'What kind of man pays to have shit like this on the walls of his cellar?'\nasked Severard, shaking his head.\n'Oh, this sort of thing was quite popular at one time. There's a room\npainted like this in the palace. This is a copy, and a cheap one.' Glokta\nlooked up at the shadowed face of Kanedias, staring grimly down into the\nroom, and the bleeding corpse on the opposite wall. 'Still, there's something\nquite unsettling about it, isn't there?' Or there would be, if I gave a damn.\n'Blood, fire, death, vengeance. No idea why you'd want it in the cellar.\nPerhaps there was something dark about our friend the merchant.'\n'There's always something dark about a man with money,' said Severard.\n'Who are these two?'\nGlokta frowned, peering forward. Two small, vague figures could be\nseen under the arms of the Maker, one on each side. 'Who knows?' asked\nGlokta, 'maybe they're his Practicals.'"

My, my, he\nmust be thoroughly tickled.\nGlokta shuffled toward the table in the centre of the room. Two chairs\nfaced each other across the smooth, polished surface. One was a spare, hard\naffair of the sort you found in the cellars of the House of Questions, but the\nother was altogether more impressive, throne-like almost, with sweeping\narms and a high back, upholstered in brown leather.\nGlokta placed his cane against the table and lowered himself carefully,\nback aching. 'Oh, this is an excellent chair,' he breathed, sinking slowly\nback into the soft leather, stretching out his leg, throbbing from the long\nwalk here. There was a slight resistance. He looked beneath the table. There\nwas a matching footstool there.\nGlokta tipped his head back and laughed. 'Oh this is fine! You shouldn't\nhave!' He settled his leg down on the stool with a comfortable sigh.\n'It was the least we could do,' said Severard, folding his arms and\nleaning against the wall next to the bleeding body of Juvens. 'We did well\nfrom your friend Rews, very well. You've always seen us right, and we don't\nforget that.'\n'Unhhh,' said Frost, nodding his head.\n'You spoil me.' Glokta stroked the polished wood on the arm of the\nchair. My boys. Where would I be without you? Back home in bed with\nmother fussing over me, I suppose, wondering how she'll ever find a nice\ngirl to marry me now. He glanced over the instruments on the table. His\ncase was there, of course, and a few other things, well-used, but still highly\nserviceable. A pair of long-handled tongs particularly caught his eye. He\nglanced up at Severard. 'Teeth?'\n'Seemed a good place to start.'\n'Fair enough.' Glokta licked at his own empty gums then cracked his\nknuckles, one by one. 'Teeth, it is.'\nAs soon as the gag was off the assassin started screaming at them in\nStyrian, spitting and cursing, struggling pointlessly at his chains. Glokta\ndidn't understand a word of it. But I think I catch the meaning, more or less.\nSomething very offensive indeed, I imagine. Something about our mothers,\nand so on. But I am not easily offended. He was a rough looking sort, face\npockmarked with acne scars, nose broken more than once and bent out of\nshape. How disappointing. I was hoping the Mercers might have gone up-\nmarket on this occasion at least, but that's merchants for you. Always\nlooking for the bargain.\nPractical Frost ended the torrent of unintelligible abuse by punching the\nman heavily in the stomach.

'Where am I?'\n'We're just off the Middleway, down near the water.' Glokta winced as\nthe muscles in his leg suddenly convulsed. He stretched it out cautiously,\nwaiting until he heard the knee click before he carried on. 'You know, the\nMiddleway is one of the very arteries of the city, it runs straight through its\nheart, from the Agriont to the sea. It passes through many different districts,\nhas all manner of notable buildings. Some of the most fashionable\naddresses in the whole city are just up the lane. To me though, it's nothing\nbut a road between two dentists.'\nThe prisoner's eyes narrowed, then darted over the instruments on the\ntable. But no more cursing. It seems the mention of dentistry has got his\nattention.\n'Up at the other end of the avenue,' and Glokta pointed roughly\nnorthwards, 'in one of the most expensive parts of town, opposite the public\ngardens, in a beautiful white house in the very shadow of the Agriont, is the\nestablishment of Master Farrad. You might have heard of him?'\n'Get fucked!'\nGlokta raised his eyebrows. If only. 'They say that Master Farrad is the\nfinest dentist in the world. I believe he came from Gurkhul originally, but\nhe escaped the tyranny of the Emperor to join us in the Union and make a\nbetter life for himself, saving our wealthiest citizens from the terrors of bad\nteeth. When I came back from my own little visit to the South, my family\nsent me to him, to see if there was anything he could do for me.' Glokta\nsmiled wide, showing the assassin the nature of the problem. 'Of course\nthere wasn't. The Emperor's torturers saw to that. But he's a damn fine\ndentist, everyone says so.'\n'So what?'\nGlokta let his smile fade. 'Down at the other end of the Middleway,\ndown near the sea, in amongst the filth and the scum and the slime of the\ndocks, am I. The rents may be cheap hereabouts, but I feel confident that,\nonce we have spent some time together, you will not think me any less\ntalented than the esteemed Master Farrad. It is simply that my talents lie in\na different direction.

'Nothing.' Tough. A tough man. But it's easy to act tough before\nthe work begins. I should know.\nGlokta rubbed his leg gently. The blood was flowing nicely now, the\npain almost gone. 'We'll keep it simple to begin with. Names, that's all I\nwant, for now. Just names. Why don't we start with yours? At least you can't\ntell us you don't know the answer.'\nThey waited.

Frost planted his fists on either side of the\nassassins jaw, started to squeeze until his teeth were forced apart. Severard\nshoved the ends of the tongs in between and forced his jaws open, much too\nwide for comfort. The assassin's eyes bulged. Hurts, doesn't it? But that's\nnothing, believe me.\n'Watch his tongue,' said Glokta, 'we want him talking.'\n'Don't worry,' muttered Severard, peering into the assassin's mouth. He\nducked back suddenly. 'Ugh!

Sat there, minding the\nspit, turning it round every once in a while and trying not to get too nervous\nwith the waiting. Tul Duru wasn't helping any with that. He was striding up\nand down the grass, round the old stones and back, wearing his great boots\nout, about as patient as a wolf on heat. Dogman watched him stomping—\nclomp, clomp, clomp. He'd learned a long time ago that great fighters are\nonly good for one thing. Fighting. At pretty much everything else, and at\nwaiting in particular, they're fucking useless.\n'Why don't you sit yourself down, Tul?' muttered Dogman. 'There's\nstones aplenty for the purpose. Warmer here by the fire and all. Rest those\nflapping feet o' yours, you're getting me twitchy'\n'Sit me down?' rumbled the giant, coming up and looming over the\nDogman like a great bloody house. 'How can I sit, or you either?' He\nfrowned across the ruins and into the trees from under his great, heavy\nbrows. 'You sure this is the place?'\n'This is the place.' Dogman stared round at the broken stones, hoping\nlike hell that it was. He couldn't deny there was no sign of 'em yet. 'They'll\nbe here, don't you worry' So long as they ain't all got themselves killed, he\nthought, but he had the sense not to say it. He'd spent enough time marching\nwith Tul Duru Thunderhead to know—you don't get that man stirred up.\nUnless you want a broken head, o' course.\n'They better be here soon is all.' Tul's bloody great hands curled up into\nfists fit to break rocks with. 'I got no taste for just sitting here, arse in the\nwind!'\n'Nor do I, neither,' said the Dogman, showing his palms and doing his\nbest to keep everything gentle, 'but don't you fret on it, big lad. They'll be\nalong soon enough, just the way we planned. This is the place.' He eyed the\nhog crackling away, dripping some nice gravy in the fire. His mouth was\nwatering good now, his nose was full of the smell of meat… and something\nelse beside. Just a whiff. He looked up, sniffing.\n'You smell something?' asked Tul, peering into the woods.\n'Something, maybe.' The Dogman leaned down and took a hold on his\nbow.\n'What is it? Shanka?'\n'Not sure, could be.' He sniffed the air again. Smelled like a man, and a\nmighty sour-smelling one at that.\n'I could have killed the fucking pair o' you!'"

Smelled like a man, and a\nmighty sour-smelling one at that.\n'I could have killed the fucking pair o' you!'\nDogman span about, half falling over and near fumbling his bow while\nhe did it. Black Dow wasn't ten strides behind him, down wind, creeping\nover to the fire with a nasty grin. Grim was at his shoulder, face blank as a\nwall, as always.\n'You bastards!' bellowed Tul. 'You near made me shit with your\nsneaking around!'\n'Good,' sneered Dow. 'You could lose some fucking lard.'\nDogman took a long breath and tossed his bow back down. Some relief\nto know they were in the right spot after all, but he could've done without\nthe scare. He'd been jumpy since he saw Logen go over the edge of that\ncliff. Roll right on over and not a thing anyone could do about it. Could\nhappen to anyone any time, death, and that was a fact.\nGrim clambered over the broken stones and sat himself down on one\nnext to the Dogman, gave him the barest of nods. 'Meat?' barked Dow,\nshoving past Tul and flopping down beside the fire, ripping a leg off the\ncarcass and tearing into it with his teeth.\nAnd that was it. That was all the greeting, after a month or more apart.\n'A man with friends is rich indeed,' muttered the Dogman out the corner of\nhis mouth.\n'Whatsay?' spat Dow, cold eyes sliding round, his mouth full of pig, his\ndirty, stubbly chin all shiny with grease.\nDogman showed his palms again. 'Nothing to take offence at.' He'd\nspent enough time marching with Black Dow to know—you might as well\ncut your own neck as make that evil bastard angry. Any trouble while we\nwas split up?' he asked, looking to change the subject.\nGrim nodded. 'Some.'\n'Fucking Flatheads!' snarled Dow, spraying bits of meat in Dogman's\nface. 'They're bloody everywhere!' He pointed the hog's leg across the fire\nlike it was a blade. 'I've taken enough of this shit! I'm going back south. It's\ntoo bloody cold by half, and fucking Flatheads everywhere! Bastards! I'm\ngoing south!'\n'You scared?' asked Tul.\nDow turned to look up at him with a big yellow grin, and the Dogman\nwinced. It was a damn fool of a question, that. He'd never been scared in his\nlife, Black Dow. Didn't know what it was to be scared. 'Feared of a few\nShanka? Me?' He gave a nasty laugh. 'We done some work on them, while\nyou two been snoring. Gave some of 'em warm beds to sleep in. Too warm\nby half.\n'Burned 'em,' muttered Grim. That was a full day's talk out of him\nalready.\n'Burned a whole fucking pile of 'em,' hissed Dow, grinning like he never\nheard such a joke as corpses on fire. 'They don't scare me, big lad, no\nmore'n you do, but I don't plan to sit here waiting for 'em neither, just so"

I'm going south!'\nAnd he tore off another mouthful of meat.\n'Who's got the flabby arse now?'\nDogman cracked a grin as he saw Threetrees striding over towards the\nfire, and he started up and grabbed the old boy by the hand. He had Forley\nthe Weakest with him and all, and Dogman clapped the little man on the\nback as he came past. Nearly knocked him over, he was that pleased to see\nthey were all alive and made it through another month. Didn't hurt to have\nsome leadership round the fire, neither. Everyone looked happy for once,\nsmiling and pressing hands and all the rest. Everyone but Dow, o' course.\nHe just sat there, staring at the fire, sucking on his bone, face sour as old\nmilk.\n'Right good to see you again, lads, and all in one piece.' Threetrees\nhefted his big round shield off his shoulder and leant it up against a broken\nold bit of wall. 'How've you been?'\n'Fucking cold,' said Dow, not even looking up. 'We're going south.'\nDogman sighed. Back together for ten heartbeats and the bickering was\nalready started. It was going to be a tough crowd now, without Logen to\nkeep things settled. A tough crowd, and apt to get bloody. Threetrees wasn't\nrushing into anything, though. He took a moment to think on it, like always.\nHe loved to take his moment, that one. That was what made him so\ndangerous. 'Going south, eh?' said Threetrees, after he'd chewed it over for\na minute. 'And just when did all this get decided?'\n'Nothing's decided,' said the Dogman, showing his palms one more\ntime. He reckoned he might be doing that a lot from now on.\nTul Duru frowned down at Dow's back. 'Nothing at all,' he rumbled,\nmightily annoyed at having his mind made up for him.\n'Nothing is right,' said Threetrees, slow and steady as the grass growing.\n'I don't recall this being no voting band.'\nDow took no time at all to think about that. He never took time, that\none. That was what made him so dangerous. He leaped up, flinging the bone\nonto the ground, squaring up to Threetrees with a fighting look. 'I… say…\nsouth!' he snarled, eyes bulging like bubbles on a stew.\nThreetrees didn't back down a step. That wouldn't have been his way at\nall. He took his moment to think on it, course, then he took a step forward\nof his own, so his nose and Dow's were almost touching. 'If you wanted a\nsay, you should have beaten Ninefingers,' he growled, 'instead of losing like\nthe rest of us.'\nBlack Dow's face turned dark as tar at that. He didn't like being\nreminded of losing. 'The Bloody-Nine's gone back to the mud!' he snarled."

'The Bloody-Nine's gone back to the mud!' he snarled.\n'Dogman seen it, didn't you?'\nDogman had to nod. 'Aye,' he muttered.\n'So that's the end of that! There's no reason for us to be pissing around\nhere, North of the mountains, with Flatheads crawling up our arses! I say\nsouth!'\n'Ninefingers may be dead,' said Threetrees in Dow's face, 'but your debt\nain't. Why he saw fit to spare a man as worthless as you I'll never know, but\nhe named me as second,' and he tapped his big chest, 'and that means I'm\nthe one with the say! Me and no other!'\nDogman took a careful step back. The two of 'em were shaping up for\nblows alright, and he'd no wish to get a bloody nose in all the confusion. It\nwould hardly have been the first time. Forley took a stab at keeping the\npeace. 'Come on boys,' he said, all nice and soft, 'there's no need for this.'\nHe might not have been much at killing, Forley, but he was a damn good\nboy for stopping those that were from killing each other. Dogman wished\nhim luck with it. 'Come on, why don't you—'\n'Shut your fucking hole, you!' growled Dow, one dirty finger stabbing\nsavage in Forley's face. 'What's your fucking say worth, Weakest?'\n'Leave him be!' rumbled Tul, holding his great fist up under Dow's chin,\n'or I'll give you something to shout about!'\nThe Dogman could hardly look. Dow and Threetrees were always\npicking at each other. They got fired up quick and damped down quick. The\nThunderhead was a different animal. Once that big ox got properly riled\nthere was no calming him. Not without ten strong men and a lot of rope.\nDogman tried to think what Logen would have done. He'd have known how\nto stop 'em fighting, if he hadn't been dead.\n'Shit!' shouted Dogman, jumping up from the fire all of a sudden.\n'There's fucking Shanka crawling all over us! And if we get through with\nthem there's always Bethod to think on! We've a world full of scores to\nsettle without making more ourselves! Logen's gone and Threetrees is\nsecond, and that's the only say I'll hear!' He did some jabbing with his own\nfinger, at no one in particular, then he waited, hoping like hell that it had\ndone the trick.\n'Aye,' grunted Grim.\nForley started nodding like a woodpecker. 'Dogman's right! We need to\nfight each other like we need the cock-rot! Threetrees is second. He's the\nchief now.'\nIt was quiet for a moment, and Dow fixed the Dogman with that cold,\nempty, killing look, like the cat with the mouse between its paws. Dogman\nswallowed.

He got the name from having the blackest\nreputation in the North, with coming sudden in the black of night, and\nleaving the villages behind him black from fire. That was the rumour. That\nwas the fact.\nIt took all the bones Dogman had not to stare at his boots. He was just\nready to do it when Dow looked away, eyed the others, one at a time. Most\nmen wouldn't have met that look, but these here weren't most men. You\ncould never have hoped to meet a bloodier crowd, not anywhere under the\nsun. Not a one of them backed down, or even seemed to consider it. Apart\nfrom Forley the Weakest, of course, he was staring at the grass before his\nturn even came.\nOnce Dow saw they were all against him he cracked a happy smile, just\nas if there never was a problem. 'Fair enough,' he said to Threetrees, the\nanger all seeming to drain away in an instant. 'What's it to be then, chief?'\nThreetrees looked over at the woods. He sniffed and sucked at his teeth.\nHe scratched at his beard, taking his moment to think on it. He looked each\none of them over, considering. 'We go south,' he said.\nHe smelled 'em before he saw 'em, but that was always the way with him.\nHe had a good nose, did the Dogman, that's how he got the name after all.\nBeing honest though, anyone could have smelled 'em. They fucking stank.\nThere were twelve down in the clearing. Sitting, eating, grunting to each\nother in their nasty, dirty tongue, big yellow teeth sticking out everywhere,\ndressed in lumps of smelly fur and reeking hide and odd bits of rusty\narmour. Shanka.\n'Fucking Flatheads,' Dogman muttered to himself. He heard a soft hiss\nbehind, turned round to see Grim peering up from behind a bush. He held\nout his open hand to say stop, tapped the top of his skull to say Flatheads,\nheld up his fist, then two fingers to say twelve, and pointed back down the\ntrack towards the others. Grim nodded and faded away into the woods.\nThe Dogman took one last look at the Shanka, just to make sure they\nwere all still unwary. They were, so he slipped back down the tree and off.\n'They're camped round the road, twelve that I saw, maybe more.'\n'They looking for us?' asked Threetrees.\n'Maybe, but they ain't looking too hard.'\n'Could we get around them?' asked Forley, always looking to miss out\non a fight.\nDow spat onto the ground, always looking to get into one. 'Twelve is\nnothing! We can do them alright!'\nThe Dogman looked over at Threetrees, thinking it out, taking his\nmoment. Twelve wasn't nothing, and they all knew it, but it might be better\nto deal with them than leave them free and easy behind.\n'What's it to be, chief?' asked Tul.\nThreetrees set his jaw. 'Weapons.'\nA fighting man's a fool that don't keep his weapons clean and ready."

'Weapons.'\nA fighting man's a fool that don't keep his weapons clean and ready.\nDogman had been over his no more'n an hour before. Still, you won't be\nkilled for checking 'em, while you might be for not doing it.\nThere was the hissing of steel on leather, the clicking of wood and the\nclanking of metal. Dogman watched Grim twang at his bowstring, check\nover the feathers on his shafts. He watched Tul Duru run his thumb down\nthe edge of his big heavy sword, almost as tall as Forley was, clucking like\na chicken at a spot of rust. He watched Black Dow rubbing a rag on the\nhead of his axe, looking at the blade with eyes soft as a lover's. He watched\nThreetrees tugging at the buckles on his shield straps, swishing his blade\nthrough the air, bright metal glinting.\nThe Dogman gave a sigh, pulled the straps on his guard tighter round\nhis left wrist, checked the wood of his bow for cracks. He made sure all his\nknives were where they should be. You can never have too many knives,\nLogen had told him once, and he'd taken it right to heart. He watched\nForley checking his short-sword with clumsy hands, his mouth chewing\naway, eyes all wet with fear. That got his own nerves jumping, and he\nglanced round at the others. Dirty, scarred, frowns' and lots of beard. There\nwas no fear there, no fear at all, but that was nothing to be shamed at.\nDifferent men have different ways, Logen had told him once, and you have\nto have fear to have courage. He'd taken that right to heart as well.\nHe walked over to Forley and gave him a clap on the shoulder. 'You\nhave to have fear to have courage,' he said.\n'That so?'\n'So they say, and it's a good thing too.' The Dogman leaned close so no\none else could hear. 'Cause I'm about ready to shit.' He reckoned that's what\nLogen would have done, and now that Logen had gone back to the mud it\nfell to him. Forley gave half a smile, but it slumped pretty fast, and he\nlooked more scared then ever. There's only so much you can do.\n'Right, boys,' said Threetrees, once the gear was all checked and stowed\nin its proper places, 'here's how we'll get it done. Grim, Dogman, opposite\nsides of their camp, out in the trees. Wait for the signal, then shoot any\nFlathead with a bow. Failing that, whatever's closest.'\n'Right you are, chief,' said the Dogman. Grim gave a nod.\n'Tul, you and me'll take the front, but wait for the signal, eh?'\n'Aye,' rumbled the giant.\n'Dow, you and Forley at the back. You come on when you see us go. But\nthis time you wait for us to go!' hissed Threetrees, stabbing with his thick\nfinger.\n'Course, chief.' Dow shrugged his shoulders, just as though he always\ndid as he was told.\n'Right then, there it is,' said Threetrees, 'anyone still confused? Any"

'Wait… for… the… fucking…\nsignal!'\nIt wasn't 'til the Dogman was hid behind a bush with his bow in his hand\nand a shaft at the ready that he realised. He'd no idea what the signal was.\nHe looked down at the Shanka, still sat there all unwary, grunting and\nshouting and banging about. By the dead he needed to piss. Always needed\nto piss before a fight. Had anyone said the signal? He couldn't remember.\n'Shit,' he whispered, and just then Dow came hurtling out from the trees,\naxe in one hand, sword in the other.\n'Fucking Flatheads!' he screamed, giving the nearest a fearsome big\nblow in the head and splattering blood across the clearing. In so far as you\ncould tell what a Shanka was thinking, these ones looked greatly surprised.\nDogman reckoned that would have to do for a signal.\nHe let loose his shaft at the nearest Flathead, just reaching for a big club\nand watched it catch it through the armpit with a satisfying thunk. 'Hah!' he\nshouted. He saw Dow spit another through the back with his sword, but\nthere was a big Shanka now with a spear ready to throw. An arrow came\nlooping out of the trees and stuck it through the neck, and it let go a squeal\nand sprawled out backwards. That Grim was a damn good shot.\nNow Threetrees came roaring from the scrub on the other side of the\nclearing, catching them off guard. He barged one Flathead in the back with\nhis shield and it sprawled face-first into the fire, he hacked at another with\nhis sword. The Dogman let go a shaft and it stuck a Shanka in its gut. It\ndropped down on its knees and a moment later Tul took its head off with a\ngreat swing of his sword.\nThe fight was joined and moving quick—chop, grunt, scrape, rattle.\nThere was blood flying and weapons swinging and bodies dropping too fast\nfor the Dogman to try an arrow at. The three of them had the last few\nhemmed in, squawking and gibbering. Tul Duru was swinging his big\nsword around, keeping them at bay. Threetrees darted in and chopped the\nlegs out from under one, and Dow cut another down as it looked round.\nThe last one squawked and made a run for the trees. Dogman shot at it,\nbut he was hurrying and he missed. The arrow almost hit Dow in the leg,\nbut luckily he didn't notice. It had almost got away into the bushes, then it\nsquealed and fell back, thrashing. Forley had stabbed it, hiding in the scrub.\n'I got one!' he yelled.\nIt was quiet for a moment, while the Dogman scrambled down toward\nthe clearing and they all looked round to see if there was anything left to\nfight, then Black Dow gave a great bellow, shaking his bloody weapons"

He looked\nround at the dead Flatheads on the ground, broken and bloody, sprawled\nand crumpled. It seemed a hollow little victory they'd had now. 'Shouldn't\nwe try and tell 'em, Threetrees?' he asked. 'Shouldn't we try and warn\nsomeone?'\n'Aye.' Threetrees gave a sad little smile.

He hardly saw anyone as he dragged himself to\nhis daily bullying from Lord Marshal Varuz. Apart from the odd premature\ntweeting of some bird in amongst the gables and the tired scraping of his\nown reluctant boots, all was quiet. No one was up at this time. No one\nshould be up at this time. Him least of all.\nHe hauled his aching legs through the archway and up the tunnel. The\nsun was barely above the horizon and the courtyard beyond was full of deep\nshadows. Squinting into the darkness he could see Varuz sat at the table,\nwaiting for him. Damn it. He had hoped to be early for once. Did the old\nbastard sleep at all?\n'Lord Marshal!' shouted Jezal, breaking into a half-hearted jog.\n'No. Not today' A shiver crept up Jezal's neck.

Jezal's skin prickled with disgust. It was\nhardly what one needed first thing in the morning.\nHe slowed to a reluctant walk and stopped next to the table. 'You will\ndoubtless be pleased to learn that there will be no running, or swimming, or\nbeam, or heavy bar today,' said the cripple. 'You won't even be needing\nthose.' He waved his cane at Jezal's fencing steels. 'We will just be having a\nlittle chat. That is all.'\nThe idea of five punishing hours with Varuz seemed suddenly very\nappealing, but Jezal was not about to show his discomfort. He tossed his\nsteels onto the table with a loud rattle and sat down carelessly in the other\nchair, Glokta regarding him from the shadows all the while. Jezal had it in\nmind to stare him into some kind of submission, but it proved a vain\nattempt. After a couple of seconds looking at that wasted face, that empty\ngrin, those fever-bright sunken eyes, he began to find the table top most\ninteresting.\n'So tell me, Captain, why did you take up fencing?'\nA game then. A private hand of cards with only two players. And\neverything that was said would get back to Varuz, that was sure. Jezal\nwould have to play his hand carefully, keep his cards close and his wits\nabout him. 'For my own honour, for that of my family, for that of my King,'\nhe said coldly. The cripple could try and find fault with that answer.\n'Ah, so it's for the benefit of your nation that you put yourself through\nthis. What a fine citizen you must be. What selflessness. What an example\nto us all.' Glokta snorted. 'Please! If you must lie, at least pick a lie that you\nyourself find convincing. That answer is an insult to us both.'\nHow dare this toothless has-been take that tone with him? Jezal's legs\ngave a twitch: he was right on the point of getting up and walking away,\nVaruz and his hideous stooge be damned. But he caught the cripple's eye as\nhe put his hands on the arms of the chair to push himself up. Glokta was\nsmiling at him, a mocking sort of smile. To leave would be to admit defeat\nsomehow. Why did he take up fencing anyway? 'My father wanted me to do\nit.'\n'So, so. My heart brims with sympathy. The loyal son, bound by his\nstrong sense of duty, is forced to fulfil his father's ambitions. A familiar tale,\nlike a comfortable old chair we all love to sit in. Tell 'em what they want to\nhear, eh? A better answer, but just as far from the truth.'\n'Why don't you tell me then?' snapped Jezal sulkily, 'since you seem to\nknow so much about it!'\n'Alright, I will.

'It was working well\nenough, until I found my way into the Emperor's prisons. What's your\nexcuse, liar?'\nJezal didn't like the way this conversation was going. He was too used\nto easy victories at the card table, and poor players. His skills had dulled.\nBetter to sit this one out until he got the measure of his new opponent. He\nclamped his jaw shut and said nothing.\n'It takes hard work, of course, winning a Contest. You should have seen\nour mutual friend Collem West working.

You've\ntwice the talent he had, and the right blood. You don't have to work one\ntenth so hard, but you refuse to work at all.'\nJezal wasn't about to let that one past. 'Not work at all? Don't I put\nmyself through this torture every day—'\n'Torture?' asked Glokta sharply.\nJezal realised too late his unfortunate choice of words. 'Well,' he\nmumbled, 'I meant.'\n'I know more than a little about both fencing and torture. Believe me\nwhen I say,' and the Inquisitor's grotesque grin grew wider still, 'that they're\ntwo quite different things.'\n'Er…' said Jezal, still off balance.\n'You have the ambitions, and the means to realise them. A little effort\nwould do it. A few months' hard work, then you would probably never need\nto try at anything again in your life, if that's what you want. A few short\nmonths, and you're set.' Glokta licked at his empty gums. 'Barring accidents\nof course. It's a great chance you've been offered. I'd take it; if I was you,\nbut I don't know.

It was the best he could do.\nGlokta raised an eyebrow, then winced, leaning heavily on his cane as\nhe slowly pushed himself to his feet.

A lot of people who haven't had the chances you've had. Give\nit up. Lord Marshal Varuz will be disappointed, and Major West, and your\nfather, and so on, but please believe me when I say,' and he leaned down,\nstill smiling his horrible smile, 'that I couldn't care less. Good day, Captain\nLuthar.' And Glokta limped off toward the archway.\nAfter that less than delightful interview, Jezal found himself with a few\nhours of unexpected free time on his hands—but he was scarcely in the\nframe of mind to enjoy it. He wandered the empty streets, squares and\ngardens of the Agriont, thinking grimly on what the cripple had said to him,\ncursing the name of Glokta, but unable to quite push the conversation from\nhis mind. He turned it over and over, every phrase, constantly coming up\nwith new things that he should have said. If only he had thought of them at\nthe time.\n'Ah, Captain Luthar!' Jezal started and looked up. A man he did not\nrecognise was sitting on the dewy grass beneath a tree, smiling up at him, a\nhalf-eaten apple in his hand. 'The early morning is the perfect time for a\nstroll, I find. Calm and grey and clean and empty. It's nothing like the gaudy\npinkness of evening time. All that clutter, all those people coming and\ngoing. How can one think in amongst all that nonsense? And now I see you\nare of the same mind. How delightful.' He took a big, crunching bite out of\nthe apple.\n'Do I know you?'\n'Oh no, no,' said the stranger, getting to his feet and brushing some dirt\nfrom the seat of his trousers, 'not yet. My name is Sulfur, Yoru Sulfur.'\n'Really? And what brings you to the Agriont?'\n'You might say I have come on a diplomatic mission.'\nJezal looked him over, trying to place his origin. 'A mission from?'\n'From my master, of course,' said Sulfur unhelpfully. His eyes were\ndifferent colours, Jezal noticed. An ugly and off-putting characteristic, he\nrather thought.\n'And your master is?'\n'A very wise and powerful man.' He stripped the core with his teeth and\ntossed it away into the bushes, wiping his hands on the front of his shirt. 'I\nsee you've been fencing.'\nJezal glanced down at his steels. 'Yes,' he said, realising that he had\nfinally come to a decision, 'but for the last time. I'm giving it up.'\n'Oh dear me, no!' The strange man seized Jezal by the shoulder. 'Oh dear\nme, no you mustn't!'\n'What?'\n'No, no! My master would be horrified if he knew. Horrified! Give up\nfencing and you give up more than that! This is how one comes to the\nnotice of the public, you see? They decide, in the end. There's no nobility\nwithout the commoners, no nobility at all! They decide!'"

Jezal glanced around the park, hoping to catch sight of a guard\nso he could notify him that a dangerous madman was loose in the Agriont.\n'No, you mustn't give it up! I won't hear of it! No indeed! I'm sure that\nyou'll stick with it after all! You must!'\nJezal shook Sulfur's hand off his shoulder. 'Who are you?'\n'Sulfur, Yoru Sulfur, at your service. See you again, Captain, at the\nContest, if not before!' And he waved over his shoulder as he strolled off.\nJezal stared after him, mouth slightly open. 'Damn it!' he shouted,\nthrowing his steels down on the grass. Everyone seemed to want to take a\nhand in his business today, even crazy strangers in the park.\nAs soon as he thought it was late enough, Jezal went to call on Major West.\nYou could always be sure of a sympathetic ear with him, and Jezal was\nhoping that he might be able to manipulate his friend into breaking the bad\nnews to Lord Marshal Varuz. That was a scene that he wanted no part of, if\nhe could possibly avoid it. He knocked on the door and waited, he knocked\nagain. The door opened.\n'Captain Luthar! What an almost unbearable honour!'\n'Ardee,' muttered Jezal, somewhat surprised to find her here, 'it's good\nto see you again.' For once he actually meant it. She was interesting, is what\nshe was. It was a new and refreshing thing for him to actually be interested\nin what a woman had to say. And she was damn good-looking too, there\nwas no denying it, and seemed prettier every time he saw her. Nothing\ncould ever happen between them, of course, what with West being his\nfriend and all, but there was no harm in looking, was there? 'Er… is your\nbrother around?'\nShe threw herself carelessly down onto the settle against the wall, one\nleg stretched out, looking very sour. 'He's out. Gone out. Always busy.\nMuch too busy for me.' There was a definite flush to her cheek. Jezal's eye\nlighted on the decanter. The stopper was out and the wine was halfway\ndown.\n'Are you drunk?'\n'Somewhat,' she squinted at a half-full wine glass at her elbow, 'but\nmostly I'm just bored.'\n'It's not even ten.'\n'Can't I be bored before ten?'\n'You know what I mean.'\n'Leave the moralising to my brother. It suits him better. And have a\ndrink.' She waved her hand at the bottle. 'You look like you need one.'\nWell, that was true enough. He poured himself a glass and sat down in a\nchair facing Ardee, while she regarded him with heavy-lidded eyes. She\ntook her own glass from the table. There was a thick book lying next to it,\nface down.\n'How's the book?' asked Jezal.\n'The Fall of the Master Maker, in three volumes. They say it's one of the"

Lot of boring rubbish,' she snorted derisively. 'Full\nof wise Magi, stern knights with mighty swords and ladies with mightier\nbosoms. Magic, violence and romance, in equal measure. Utter shit.' She\nslapped the book off the table and it tumbled onto the carpet, pages\nflapping.\n'There must be something you can find to keep busy?'\n'Really? What would you suggest?'\n'My cousins do a lot of embroidery.'\n'Fuck yourself.'\n'Hmm,' said Jezal, smiling. The swearing no longer seemed half so\noffensive as it had done when they first met. 'What did you do at home, in\nAngland?'\n'Oh, home,' her head dropped against the back of the settle. 'I thought I\nwas bored there. I could hardly wait to come here to the bright centre of\nthings. Now I can hardly wait to go back. Marry some farmer. Have a dozen\nbrats. At least I'd get some conversation that way.' She closed her eyes and\nsighed. 'But Collem won't let me. He feels responsible, now that our father's\ndead. Thinks it's too dangerous. He'd rather I didn't get slaughtered by the\nNorthmen, but that's about where his sense of responsibility ends. It\ncertainly doesn't extend to spending ten minutes together with me. So it\nlooks like I'm stuck here, with all you arrogant snobs.'\nJezal shifted uncomfortably in his seat. 'He seems to manage.'\n'Oh yes,' snorted Ardee, 'Collem West, he's a damn fine fellow! Won a\nContest don't you know? First through the breach at Ulrioch, wasn't he? No\nbreeding at all, never be one of us, but a damn fine fellow, for a commoner!\nShame about that upstart sister of his though, too clever by half. And they\nsay she drinks,' she whispered. 'Doesn't know her place. Total disgrace. Best\njust to ignore her.' She sighed again. 'Yes, the sooner I go home, the happier\neveryone will be.'\n'I won't be happier.' Damn, did he say that out loud?\nArdee laughed, none too pleasantly. 'Well, it's enormously noble of you\nto say so. Why aren't you fencing anyway?'\n'Marshal Varuz was busy today.' He paused for a moment. 'In fact, I had\nyour friend Sand dan Glokta as fencing master this morning.'\n'Really? What did he have to say for himself?'\n'Various things. He called me a fool.'\n'Imagine that.'\nJezal frowned. 'Yes, well. I'm as bored with fencing as you are with that\nbook. That was what I wanted to talk to your brother about. I'm thinking of\ngiving it up.'\nShe burst out laughing. Snorting, gurgling peals of it. Her whole body\nwas shaking. Wine sloshed out of her glass and splattered across the floor.\n'What's so funny?' he demanded.\n'It's just,' she wiped a tear from her eye, 'I had a bet with Collem. He"

'For my brother it was serious, he had to do it!\nNo one even notices you if you don't have a \"dan\" in your name, and who'd\nknow better than me?

'Ask the Lord Marshal if\nhe has space for a pupil, would you? At least then I'd have someone to talk\nto!'\nJezal blinked. That wasn't interesting. That was rude. 'Hold on, you've\nno idea what it's like to—'\n'Oh stop whinging! How old are you? Five? Why don't you go back to\nsucking on your mother's tit, infant?'\nHe could hardly believe what he was hearing. How dare she? 'My\nmother's dead,' he said. Hah. That should make her feel guilty, squeeze an\napology out of her. It didn't.\n'Dead? Lucky her, at least she doesn't have to listen to your damn\nwhining! You spoiled little rich boys are all the same. You get everything\nyou could possibly want, then throw a tantrum because you have to pick it\nup yourself! You're pathetic! You make me fucking sick!'\nJezal goggled. His face was burning, stinging, as if he'd been slapped.\nHe'd rather have been slapped. He had never been spoken to like that in his\nlife. Never! It was worse than Glokta. Much worse, and far more\nunexpected. He realised his mouth was hanging half open. He snapped it\nshut, grinding his teeth together, slapped his glass down on the table, and\ngot up to leave. He was turning to the door when it suddenly opened,\nleaving him and Major West staring at each other.\n'Jezal,' said West, looking at first simply surprised and then, as he\nglanced over at his sister, sprawling on the settle, slightly suspicious. 'What\nare you doing here?'\n'Er… I came to see you actually.'\n'Oh yes?'\n'Yes. But it can wait. I've things to do.' And Jezal pushed past his friend\nand out into the corridor.\n'What was all that about?' He heard West saying as he strode away from\nthe room.

How dare she? He had wasted time on her, and laughed at her\njokes, and found her attractive! She should have been honoured to be\nnoticed!\n'That fucking bitch!' he snarled to himself.

The more he thought about it, the more it made\nsense. He'd win this damn Contest, is what he'd do! That'd wipe the smiles\noff their faces! He set off briskly down the corridor, with a strange new\nfeeling building in his chest.\nA sense of purpose. That was what it was. Perhaps it wasn't too late for\na run.\nHow Dogs are Trained\n« ^ »\nPractical Frost stood by the wall, utterly motionless, utterly silent, barely\nvisible in the deep shadows, a part of the building. The albino hadn't moved\nan inch in an hour or more, hadn't shifted his feet, hadn't blinked, hadn't\nbreathed that Glokta had noticed, his eyes fixed on the street before them.\nGlokta himself cursed, shifted uncomfortably, winced, scratched his\nface, sucked at his empty gums. What's keeping them? A few minutes more\nand I might fall asleep, drop into that stinking canal and drown. How very\napt that would be. He watched the oily, smelly water below him flap and\nripple. Body found floating by the docks, bloated by seawater and far, far\nbeyond recognition…\nFrost touched his arm in the darkness, pointed down the street with a\nbig white finger. Three men were moving slowly toward them, walking\nwith the slightly bow-legged stance of men who spend a lot of time aboard\nship, keeping their balance on a swaying deck. So that's one half of our\nlittle party. Better late than never. The three sailors came halfway across the\nbridge over the canal then stopped and waited, no more than twenty strides\naway. Glokta could hear the tone of their conversation: brash, confident,\ncommon accents. He shuffled slightly further into the shadows clinging to\nthe building.\nNow footsteps came from the opposite direction, hurried footsteps. Two\nmore men appeared, walking quickly down the street. One, a very tall, thin\nfellow in an expensive-looking fur coat was glancing suspiciously around\nhim. That must be Gofred Hornlach, senior Mercer. Our man. His\ncompanion had a sword at his hip, and was struggling with a big wooden\ntrunk over one shoulder. Servant, or bodyguard, or both. He is of no\ninterest.

Hornlach exchanged a few quick words with one of the\nsailors, a man with a big brown beard.\n'Ready?' he whispered to Frost. The Practical nodded.\n'Hold!' shouted Glokta at the top of his voice, 'in the name of his\nMajesty!' Hornlach's servant spun round, dropping the trunk onto the bridge\nwith a bang, hand moving toward his sword. There was a soft twang from\nthe shadows on the other side of the road. The servant looked surprised,\ngave a snort, then toppled onto his face. Practical Frost strode swiftly out of\nthe shadows, feet padding on the road.\nHornlach stared down, wide-eyed, at the corpse of his bodyguard, then\nacross at the hulking albino. He turned to the sailors. 'Help me!' he cried.\n'Stop him!'\nTheir leader smiled back. 'I don't think so.' His two companions moved\nwithout hurry to block the bridge. The Mercer stumbled away, took a\nfaltering step toward the shadows by the canal on the other side. Severard\nappeared from a doorway before him, flatbow rested across his shoulder.\nReplace the bow with a bunch of flowers and he'd look as if he was on his\nway to a wedding. You'd never think that he just killed a man.\nSurrounded, Hornlach could only look around dumbly, eyes wide with\nfear and surprise, as the two Practicals approached, Glokta limping up\nbehind them. 'But I paid you!' Hornlach shouted desperately at the sailors.\n'You paid me for a berth,' said their Captain. 'Loyalty is extra.'\nPractical Frost's big white hand slapped down on the merchant's\nshoulder, forced him onto his knees. Severard strolled over to the\nbodyguard, wedged the dirty toe of his boot under the body and rolled it\nover. The corpse stared up at the night sky, eyes glassy, the feathers of the\nflatbow bolt sticking out from his neck. The blood round his mouth looked\nblack in the moonlight.\n'Dead,' grunted Severard, most unnecessarily.\n'A bolt through the neck will do that,' said Glokta. 'Clean him up, would\nyou?'\n'Right you are.' Severard grabbed the bodyguard's feet and hauled them\nover the parapet of the bridge, then he took him under the armpits and\nheaved the body straight over the side with a grunt. So smooth, so clean, so\npractised. You can tell he's done it before. There was a splash as the corpse\nhit the slimy water below. Frost had Hornlach's hands tied firmly behind\nhim now, and the bag on. The prisoner squawked through the canvas as he\nwas dragged to his feet. Glokta himself shuffled over to the three sailors, his\nlegs numb after all that time spent standing still in the alley.\n'And here we are,' he said, pulling a heavy purse from his inside coat\npocket. He held it swinging just above the Captain's waiting palm. 'Tell me,\nwhat happened tonight?'"

'Always pleased to do his\nMajesty a favour!' And he and his two companions turned, all yellow\nsmiles, and made off toward the quay.\n'Right then,' said Glokta, 'let's get on with it.'\n'Where are my clothes?' shouted Hornlach, wriggling in his chair.\n'I do apologise for that. I know it's quite uncomfortable, but clothes can\nhide things. Leave a man his clothes and you leave him pride, and dignity,\nand all kinds of things it's better not to have in here. I never question a\nprisoner with their clothes on. Do you remember Salem Rews?'\n'Who?'\n'Salem Rews. One of your people. A Mercer. We caught him dodging\nthe King's taxes. He made a confession, named a few people. I wanted to\ntalk to them, but they all died.'\nThe merchants eyes flickered left and right. Thinking about his options,\ntrying to guess what we might know. 'People die all the time.'\nGlokta stared at the painted corpse of Juvens behind his prisoner,\nbleeding bright red paint all over the wall. People die all the time. 'Of\ncourse, but not quite so violently. I have a notion that someone wanted them\ndead, that someone ordered them dead. I have a notion it was you.'\n'You've got no proof! No proof! You won't get away with this!'\n'Proof means nothing, Hornlach, but I'll indulge you. Rews survived.\nHe's just down the hall, as it goes, no friends left, blubbering away, naming\nevery Mercer he can think of, or that we can think of, for that matter.'\nNarrowed eyes, but no reply. 'We used him to catch Carpi.'\n'Carpi?' asked the merchant, trying to look nonchalant.\n'Surely you remember your assassin? Slightly flabby Styrian? Acne\nscars? Swears a lot? We have him too. He told us the whole story. How you\nhired him, how much you paid him, what you asked him to do. The whole\nstory.' Glokta smiled.

Now comes the bargaining.\n'Inquisitor,' he said in a wheedling tone, 'if I've learned one thing from life,\nit's that every man wants something. Every man has his price, yes?

Then perhaps I'll settle for your head on a stick. You've nothing\nelse I want, no matter how deep your pockets are.' Hornlach was trembling\nslightly now. No more bluster? No more deals? Then we can begin. Glokta\npicked up the paper in front of him, and read the first question. 'What is\nyour name?'\n'Look, Inquisitor, I…' Frost smashed the table with his fist and Hornlach\ncowered in his chair.\n'Answer his fucking question!' screamed Severard in his face.\n'Gofred Hornlach,' squealed the merchant.\nGlokta nodded.

Glokta glanced up at Practical Frost. The big white fist\nsank into the merchants gut, and he gave a gentle sigh and slid sideways.\n'My mother keeps dogs, you know,' said Glokta.\n'Dogs,' hissed Severard in the gasping merchant's ear, as he shoved him\nback into the chair.\n'She loves them.

A\nfew Named Men, a few hard fighters, bearing down on you from a place\nyou never expected them, that's a terrifying thing. That'd make them run.\nBut tired as they'd be, they wouldn't run too fast. That means prisoners, and\nprisoners might mean ransoms, or at least enemies cheaply killed. I see a\nslaughter, or a victory worth the singing, depending which side you're on.\nThat's what I see.'\nBayaz smiled, head nodding with the slow movement of his horse. 'Was\nit Stolicus who said the ground must be a general's best friend, or it\nbecomes his worst enemy?'\n'I never heard of him, but he was right enough. This is good ground for\nan army, providing you got here first. Getting there first is the trick.'\n'Indeed. We don't have an army, however.'\n'These trees could hide a few horsemen even better than a lot.' Logen\nglanced sidelong at the wizard. He was slouched happily in the saddle,\nenjoying a pleasant ride in the country. 'I don't think Bethod will have\nappreciated your advice, and I had scores enough with him already. He got\nwounded where he feels it most, in his pride. He'll want vengeance. Want it\nbadly'\n'Ah yes, vengeance, that most widespread of Northern pastimes. Its\npopularity never seems to wane.'\nLogen stared grimly around at the trees, the rocks, the folds in the\nvalley's sides, the many hiding places. 'There'll be men out in these hills,\nlooking for us. Small bands of skilled and battle-hardened men, well\nmounted and well armed, familiar with the land. Now Bethod has finished\nall his enemies there's nowhere in the North out of his reach. They might be\nwaiting there,' he pointed off towards some rocks by the road, 'or in those\ntrees, or those.' Malacus Quai, riding up ahead with the packhorse, glanced\nnervously around. 'They could be anywhere.'\n'Does that frighten you?' asked Bayaz."

'They could be anywhere.'\n'Does that frighten you?' asked Bayaz.\n'Everything frightens me, and it's well that it does. Fear is a good friend\nto the hunted, it's kept me alive this long. The dead are fearless, and I don't\ncare to join them. He'll send men to the library too.'\n'Oh yes, to burn my books and so on.'\n'Does that frighten you?'\n'Not much. The stones by the gate have the word of Juvens on them, and\nthat is not to be denied, even now. No one with violence in mind can come\nnear. I imagine Bethod's men will wander around the lake in the rain until\nthey run out of food, all the while thinking how very strange it is that they\ncannot find so large a thing as a library. No,' said the wizard happily,\nscratching at his beard. 'I would concentrate on our own predicament. What\nhappens, do you think, if we're caught?'\n'Bethod will kill us, and in the most unpleasant manner he can think of.\nUnless he has it in mind to be merciful, and let us off with a warning.'\n'That doesn't seem likely.'\n'I've been thinking the same thing. Our best chance is to make for the\nWhiteflow, try to get across the river into Angland, and trust to luck we\naren't seen.' Logen didn't like trusting to luck, the very word left a sour\ntaste. He peered up at the cloudy sky. 'We could do with some bad weather.\nA healthy downpour could hide us nicely.' The skies had been pissing on\nhim for weeks, but now that he needed rain they refused to produce a drop.\nMalacus Quai was looking over his shoulder at them, his eyes big and\nround with worry. 'Shouldn't we try to move faster?'\n'Perhaps,' said Logen, patting the neck of his horse, 'but that would tire\nthe horses, and we may need all the speed we can get later. We could hide in\nthe day and travel by night, but then we risk getting lost. We're better as we\nare. Move slowly and hope we aren't seen.' He frowned at the hilltop. 'Hope\nwe haven't been seen already.'\n'Hmm,' said Bayaz, 'then this might be the best time to tell you. That\nwitch Caurib isn't half the fool I pretended she was.'\nLogen felt a sinking sensation. 'No?'\n'No, for all her paint and gold and chat about the utmost north, she\nknows what she is about. The long eye, they call it. An old trick, but\neffective. She has been watching us.'\n'She knows where we are?'\n'She knows when we left, more than likely, and in what direction we\nwere heading.'\n'That does nothing for our chances.'\n'I should say not.'\n'Shit.' Logen caught some movement in the trees to their left, and he\nsnatched hold of the hilt of his sword. A couple of birds took to the skies.\nHe waited, heart in his mouth. Nothing. He let his hand drop back. 'We\nshould have killed them while we had the chance. All three of them.'"

Bayaz looked over at Logen. 'If they do\ncatch us, what's your plan?'\n'Run. And hope our horses are the faster.'\n'And this one?' asked Bayaz.\nThe wind blew keenly through the hollow in spite of the trees, making\nthe flames of the campfire flicker and dance. Malacus Quai hunched his\nshoulders and drew his blanket tight around them. He peered at the short\nstem that Bayaz was holding up to him, forehead crinkled with\nconcentration.\n'Erm…' This was the fifth plant, and the miserable apprentice had yet to\nget one of them right. 'Is that… er… Ilyith?'\n'Ilyith?' echoed the wizard, his face giving no clue as to whether it was\nthe right answer. He was merciless as Bethod where his apprentice was\nconcerned.\n'Perhaps?'\n'Hardly.' The apprentice closed his eyes and sighed for the fifth time that\nevening. Logen felt for him, he really did, but there was nothing to be done.\n'Ursilum, in the old tongue, the round-leafed kind.'\n'Yes, yes, of course, Ursilum, it was at the end of my tongue the whole\ntime.'\n'If the name was at the end of your tongue, then the uses of the plant\ncannot be far behind, eh?'\nThe apprentice narrowed his eyes and looked hopefully up towards the\nnight sky, as though the answer might be written in the stars. 'Is it… for\naches in the joints?'\n'No, it is decidedly not. I am afraid your aching joints will still be\ntroubling you.' Bayaz turned the stem slowly round in his fingers. 'Ursilum\nhas no uses, not that I know of. It's just a plant.' And he tossed it away into\nthe bushes.\n'Just a plant,' echoed Quai, shaking his head. Logen sighed and rubbed\nhis tired eyes.\n'I'm sorry, Master Ninefingers, are we boring you?'\n'What does it matter?' asked Logen, throwing his hands up in the air.\n'Who cares about the name of a plant with no use?'\nBayaz smiled. 'A fair point. Tell us, Malacus, what does it matter?'\n'If a man seeks to change the world, he should first understand it.' The\napprentice trotted the words out as if by rote, evidently relieved to be asked\na question he knew the answer to. 'The smith must learn the ways of metals,\nthe carpenter the ways of wood, or their work will be of but little worth.\nBase magic is wild and dangerous, for it comes from the Other Side, and to\ndraw from the world below is fraught with peril. The Magus tempers magic\nwith knowledge, and thus produces High Art, but like the smith or the\ncarpenter, he should only seek to change that which he understands. With\neach thing he learns, his power is increased. So must the Magus strive to\nlearn all, to understand the world entire. The tree is only as strong as its\nroot, and knowledge is the root of power.'"

The tree is only as strong as its\nroot, and knowledge is the root of power.'\n'Don't tell me, Juvens' Principles of Art?'\n'The very first lines,' said Bayaz.\n'Forgive me for saying so, but I've been on this world for more than\nthirty years, and I've yet to understand a single thing that's happened. To\nknow the world completely? To understand everything? That's quite a task.'\nThe Magus chuckled. 'An impossible one, to be sure. To truly know and\nunderstand even a blade of grass is the study of a lifetime, and the world is\never changing. That is why we tend to specialise.'\n'So what did you choose?'\n'Fire,' said Bayaz, gazing happily into the flames, the light dancing on\nhis bald head. 'Fire, and force, and will. But even in my chosen fields, after\ncountless long years of study, I remain a novice. The more you learn, the\nmore you realise how little you know. Still, the struggle itself is worthwhile.\nKnowledge is the root of power, after all.'\n'So with enough knowledge, you Magi can do anything?'\nBayaz frowned. 'There are limits. And there are rules.'\n'Like the First Law?' Master and apprentice glanced up at Logen as one.\n'It's forbidden to speak with devils, am I right?' It was plain that Quai didn't\nremember his fevered outburst, his mouth was open with surprise. Bayaz'\neyes only narrowed a little, with the faintest trace of suspicion.\n'Why, yes you are,' said the First of the Magi. 'It is forbidden to touch\nthe Other Side direct. The First Law must apply to all, without exception.\nAs must the Second.'\n'Which is?'\n'It is forbidden to eat the flesh of men.'\nLogen raised an eyebrow. 'You wizards get up to some strange stuff.'\nBayaz smiled. 'Oh, you don't know the half of it.' He turned to his\napprentice, holding up a lumpy brown root. 'And now, Master Quai, would\nyou be good enough to tell me the name of this?'\nLogen couldn't help grinning to himself. He knew this one.\n'Come, come, Master Quai, we don't have all night.'\nLogen wasn't able to stand the apprentice's misery any longer. He leaned\ntoward him, pretending to poke at the fire with a stick, coughed to conceal\nhis words and whispered, 'Crow's Foot,' under his breath. Bayaz was a good\ndistance away, and the wind was still rustling in the trees. There was no way\nthe Magus could have heard him.\nQuai played his part well. He continued to peer at the root, brow knitted\nin thought. 'Is it Crow's Foot?' he ventured.\nBayaz raised an eyebrow. 'Why, yes it is. Well done, Malacus. And can\nyou tell me its uses?'\nLogen coughed again. 'Wounds,' he whispered, looking carelessly off\ninto the bushes, one hand shielding his mouth. He might not know too much\nabout plants, but on the subject of wounds he had a wealth of experience."

He might not know too much\nabout plants, but on the subject of wounds he had a wealth of experience.\n'I believe it's good for wounds,' said Quai slowly.\n'Excellent, Master Quai. Crow's Foot is correct. And it is good for\nwounds. I am glad to see we are making some progress after all.' He cleared\nhis throat. 'It does seem curious that you should use that name however.\nThey only call this Crow's Foot north of the mountains. I certainly never\ntaught you that name. I wonder who it is you know, from that part of the\nworld?' He glanced over at Logen. 'Have you ever considered a career in the\nmagical arts, Master Ninefingers?' He narrowed his eyes at Quai once more.\n'I may have space for an apprentice.'\nMalacus hung his head. 'Sorry, Master Bayaz.'\n'You are indeed. Perhaps you could clean the pots for us. That task may\nbe better suited to your talents.'\nQuai reluctantly shrugged off his blanket, collected the dirty bowls and\nshuffled off through the brush towards the stream. Bayaz bent over the pot\non the fire, adding some dried-up leaves to the bubbling water. The\nflickering light of the flames caught the underside of his face, the steam\ncurled around his bald head. All in all, he looked quite the part.\n'What is that?' asked Logen, reaching for his pipe. 'Some spell? Some\npotion? Some great work of High Art?'\n'Tea.'\n'Eh?'\n'Leaves of a certain plant, boiled up in water. It is considered quite a\nluxury in Gurkhul.' He poured some of the brew out into a cup. 'Would you\nlike to try it?'\nLogen sniffed at it suspiciously. 'Smells like feet.'\n'Suit yourself.' Bayaz shook his head and sat back down beside the fire,\nwrapping both hands around the steaming cup. 'But you're missing out on\none of nature's greatest gifts to man.' He took a sip and smacked his lips in\nsatisfaction. 'Calming to the mind, invigorating to the body. There are few\nills a good cup of tea won't help with.'\nLogen pressed a lump of chagga into the bowl of his pipe. 'How about\nan axe in the head?'\n'That's one of them,' admitted Bayaz with a grin. 'Tell me, Master\nNinefingers, why all the blood between you and Bethod? Did you not fight\nfor him many times? Why do you hate each other so?'\nLogen paused as he was sucking smoke from the pipe, let his breath out.\n'There are reasons,' he said stiffly. The wounds of that time were still raw.\nHe didn't like anyone picking at them.\n'Ah, reasons.' Bayaz looked down at his tea-cup. 'And what of your\nreasons? Does this feud not cut both ways?'\n'Perhaps.'\n'But you are willing to wait?'\n'I'll have to be.'\n'Hmm.

The men he'd killed for their\nambitions. He thought of the Shanka, and his family, and the ruins of the\nvillage by the sea. He thought of all his dead friends. He sucked at his teeth\nand stared at the fire.\n'I've settled a few scores in my time, but it only led to more. Vengeance\ncan feel fine, but it's a luxury. It doesn't fill your belly, or keep the rain off.\nTo fight my enemies I need friends behind me, and I'm clean out of friends.\nYou have to be realistic. It's been a while since my ambitions went beyond\ngetting through each day alive.'\nBayaz laughed, his eyes glittering in the firelight. 'What?' asked Logen,\nhanding the pipe across to him.\n'No offence, but you are an endless source of surprises. Not at all what I\nwas expecting. You are quite the riddle.'\n'Me?'\n'Oh yes! The Bloody-Nine,' he whispered, opening his eyes up wide.\n'That's one bastard of a reputation you're carrying, my friend. The stories\nthey tell! One bastard of a name! Why, mothers scare their children with it!'\nLogen said nothing. There was no denying it. Bayaz sucked slowly on the\npipe, then blew out a long plume of smoke. 'I've been thinking about the\nday that Prince Calder paid us a visit.'\nLogen snorted. 'I try not to spare him too much thought.'\n'Nor I, but it wasn't his behaviour that interested me, it was yours.'\n'It was? I don't remember doing a thing.'\nBayaz pointed the stem of the pipe at Logen from across the fire. 'Ah,\nbut that is my point exactly. I have known many fighting men, soldiers and\ngenerals and champions and whatnot. A great fighter must act quickly,\ndecisively, whether with his own arm or with an army, for he who strikes\nfirst often strikes last. So fighters come to rely on their baser instincts, to\nanswer always with violence, to become proud and brutal.' Bayaz passed\nthe pipe back to Logen. 'But whatever the stories, you are not such a one.'\n'I know plenty who'd disagree.'\n'Perhaps, but the fact remains, Calder slighted you, and you did nothing.\nSo you know when you should act, and act quickly, but you also know\nwhen not to. That shows restraint, and a calculating mind.'\n'Perhaps I was just afraid.'\n'Of him? Come now. You didn't seem afraid of Scale and he's a deal\nmore worrying. And you walked forty miles with my apprentice over your\nback, and that shows courage, and compassion too. A rare combination,\nindeed. Violence and restraint, calculation and compassion—and you speak\nto the spirits too.'\nLogen raised an eyebrow. 'Not often, and only when there's no one else\naround. Their talk is dull, and not half so flattering as yours.'\n'Hah. That's true. The spirits have little to say to men, I understand,\nthough I have never spoken with them; I have not the gift.

He took another swallow from his cup, peering at Logen over the rim.\n'I can scarcely think of another one alive.'\nMalacus stumbled from the trees, shivering, and set the wet bowls\ndown. He grabbed his blanket, wrapped it tightly around him, then peered\nhopefully at the steaming pot on the fire. 'Is that tea?'\nBayaz ignored him. 'Tell me, Master Ninefingers, in all the time since\nyou arrived at my library, you have never once asked me why I sent for you,\nor why now we are wandering through the North in peril of our lives. That\nstrikes me as odd.'\n'Not really. I don't want to know.'\n'Don't want to?'\n'All my life I've sought to know things. What's on the other side of the\nmountains? What are my enemies thinking? What weapons will they use\nagainst me? What friends can I trust?' Logen shrugged. 'Knowledge may be\nthe root of power, but each new thing I've learned has left me worse off.' He\nsucked again on the pipe, but it was finished. He tapped the ashes out onto\nthe ground. 'Whatever it is you want from me I will try to do, but I don't\nwant to know until it's time. I'm sick of making my own decisions. They're\nnever the right ones. Ignorance is the sweetest medicine, my father used to\nsay. I don't want to know'\nBayaz stared at him. It was the first time Logen had seen the First of the\nMagi look at all surprised. Malacus Quai cleared his throat. 'I'd like to\nknow,' he said in a small voice, looking hopefully up at his master.\n'Yes,' murmured Bayaz, 'but you don't get to ask.'\nIt was around midday that it all went wrong. Logen was just starting to\nthink that they might make it to the Whiteflow, maybe even live out the\nweek. It felt as if he lost his concentration for just a moment. Unfortunately,\nit was the one moment that mattered.\nStill, it was well done, you had to give them that. They'd chosen their\nspot carefully, and tied rags around their horse's hooves, to muffle the\nsound. Threetrees might have seen it coming, if he'd been with them, but he\nhad an eye for the ground like no other. The Dogman might have smelled\nthem, if he'd been there, but he had the nose for it. The fact was, neither of\nthem were there. The dead are no help at all.\nThere were three horsemen, waiting for them as they rounded a blind\ncorner, well armed and armoured, dirty faces but clean weapons, veterans\neach man. The one on the right was thickset and powerful-looking, with\nalmost no neck. The one on the left was tall and gaunt with small, hard\neyes. Both of them had round helmets, coats of weathered mail, and long\nspears lowered and ready.

'It'd\nwarm my heart to see you too, if things were different.'\n'But they are as they are.' The old warrior's eyes moved slowly over\nBayaz, Quai, and Logen as he spoke, taking in their weapons, or the lack of\nthem, working out his game. A stupider opponent could have evened up the\nodds, but Blacktoe was a Named Man, and no fool. His eyes came to rest on\nLogen's hand as it crept slowly across his body towards the hilt of his\nsword, and he shook his head slowly. 'None of your tricks, Bloody-Nine.\nYou can see we've got you.' And he nodded over at the trees behind them.\nLogen's heart sank even lower. Two more riders had appeared and were\ntrotting forwards to complete the trap, their muffled hooves barely making a\nsound on the soft ground by the road. Logen chewed his lip. Blacktoe was\nright, damn him. The four horsemen closed in, lowered spear-points\nswaying, faces cold, minds set to the task. Malacus Quai stared at them with\nfrightened eyes, his horse shying back. Bayaz smiled pleasantly as though\nthey were his oldest friends. Logen would have liked a touch of the wizard's\ncomposure. His own heart was hammering, his mouth was sour.\nBlacktoe nudged his horse forward, one hand gripping the shaft of his\naxe, the other resting on his knee, not even using the reins. He was a\nmasterful horseman, famous for it. That's what happens when a man loses\nall his toes to the frost. Riding is quicker than walking, that has to be\nadmitted, but when it came to fighting Logen preferred to keep his feet\nfirmly on the ground. 'Better be coming with us now,' said the old warrior,\n'better all round.'\nLogen could hardly agree, but the odds were stacked high against him.\nA sword may have a voice, as Bayaz had said, but a spear is a damn good\nthing for poking a man off a horse, and there were four of them closing in\naround him. He was caught—outnumbered, off-guard, and with the wrong\ntools for the task. Yet again. Best to play for time, and hope some chance\nmight show itself. Logen cleared his throat, doing his best to take the fear\nout of his voice. 'Never thought you'd make your peace with Bethod,\nBlacktoe, not you.'\nThe old warrior scratched at his long, matted beard. 'I was one of the\nlast, truth be told, but I knelt in the end, same as all the rest. Can't say I\nliked it any, but there it is. Best let me have the blade, Ninefingers.'\n'What about Old Man Yawl?

He just looked sad,\nand tired. 'Yawl's dead, as though you didn't know. Most of 'em are. Bethod\ndoesn't suit me much at all as a master, and nor do his sons. No man likes\nlicking Scales fat arse, or Calder's skinny one, you should know that. Now\ngive up the sword, the day's wasting and we've ground to cover. We can talk\njust as well with you unarmed.'\n'Yawl's dead?'\n'Aye,' said Blacktoe suspiciously. 'He offered Bethod a duel. Didn't you\nhear? The Feared done for him.'\n'Feared?'\n'Where've you been, under a mountain?'\n'More or less. What's this Feared?'\n'I don't know what he is.' Blacktoe leaned from his saddle and spat in\nthe grass. 'I heard he's not a man at all. They say that bitch Caurib dug him\nout from under a hill. Who knows? Leastways, he's Bethod's new\nchampion, and far nastier even than the last, no offence.'\n'None at all,' said Logen. The man with no neck had moved in close. A\nlittle too close perhaps, the point of his spear was hovering only a foot or\ntwo away. Close enough for Logen to grab a hold of. Maybe. 'Old Man\nYawl was a strong hand.'\n'Aye. That's why we followed him. But it done him no good. This\nFeared broke him. Broke him bad, like he was no more'n a dog. Left him\nalive, if you could call it that, so we could learn from his mistake, but he\ndidn't live long. Most of us knelt right then, those with wives and sons to\nthink on. No sense in putting it off. There's a few of them still, up in the\nmountains, who won't bow to Bethod. That moon-worshipping madman\nCrummock-i-Phail and his hillmen, and a few beside. But not many. And\nthose there are, Bethod's got plans for.' Blacktoe held out a big, calloused\nhand. 'Better let me have the blade, Bloody-Nine. Left hand only, if you\nplease, slow as slow and none of your tricks. Better all round.'\nSo that was it. Out of time. Logen wrapped the three fingers of his left\nhand round the hilt of his sword, the cold metal pressing into his palm. The\nbig man's spear point edged a little closer. The tall one had relaxed a little,\nconfident they had him. His spear was pointing up into the air, unready.\nThere was no telling what the two behind were doing. The desire to glance\nover his shoulder was almost irresistible, but Logen forced himself to look\nahead.\n'I always had respect for you, Ninefingers, even though we stood on\ndifferent sides. I've no feud with you. But Bethod wants vengeance, he's\ndrunk on it, and I swore to serve.' Blacktoe looked him sadly in the eye. 'I'm\nsorry it's me. For what it's worth.'"

He slid the sword slowly\nfrom the scabbard. 'For what it's worth,' and he snapped his arm out,\nsmashing the sword's pommel into Blacktoe's mouth. The old warrior gave\na squawk as the dull metal crunched into his teeth and tumbled backwards\nout of the saddle, his axe flying from his hand and clattering into the road.\nLogen grabbed hold of the shaft of the big man's spear, just below the blade.\n'Go!' he bellowed at Quai, but the apprentice only stared back, blinking.\nThe man with no neck pulled hard at the spear, nearly jerking Logen out of\nthe saddle, but he kept his grip. He reared up in the stirrups, raising the\nsword high above his head. Neckless took one hand from his spear, his eyes\ngoing wide, and held it up on an instinct. Logen swung the sword down\nwith all his strength.\nHe was shocked by the sharpness of it. It took the big man's arm off just\nbelow the elbow then struck into his shoulder, cleaving through the fur and\nthe mail beneath and splitting him to his stomach, near in half. Blood\nshowered across the road, spattering in the face of Logen's horse. It was\ntrained for riding but not for war and it reared and span around, kicking and\nplunging in a panic. It was the best Logen could do to stay on top of the\ndamn thing. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Bayaz smack Quai's horse\non the rump, and it sped off with the apprentice bouncing in the saddle, the\npackhorse galloping along behind.\nThen everything was a mess of plunging and snorting beasts, clashing\nand scraping metal, curses and cries. Battle. A familiar place, but no less\nterrifying for that. Logen clung to the reins with his right hand as his horse\nbucked and thrashed, swinging the sword wildly round his head, more to\nscare his enemies than hurt them. Every moment he expected the jolt and\nsearing pain as he was stuck through with a spear, then the ground to rush\nup and smack him in the face.\nHe saw Quai and Bayaz galloping away down the road, hotly pursued\nby the tall man, his spear couched under his arm. He saw Blacktoe rolling\nto his feet, spitting blood, scrambling for his axe. He saw the two men\nwho'd come from behind fighting for control of their own twisting horses,\nspears waving in their hands. He saw the body of the one he'd just killed loll\nin half and topple slowly out of the saddle, blood pouring out over the\nmuddy ground.\nLogen squawked as he felt a spear-point dig into the back of his\nshoulder, and he was shoved forward, almost over his horse's head. Then he\nrealised he was facing down the road, and still alive. He dug his heels into\nthe flanks of his horse and it sped away, sending mud flying from its hooves\nand into the faces of the men behind. He fumbled the sword across into his"

He fumbled the sword across into his\nright hand, nearly dropping the reins and falling into the road. He shrugged\nhis shoulder but the wound didn't feel too bad—he could still move the arm\nalright.\n'I'm still alive. Still alive.' The road flashed by beneath him, the wind\nstinging his eyes. He was making ground on the tall man—the rags on his\nhorse's hooves were slowing him down now, slipping on the muddy ground.\nLogen gripped the hilt of the sword as hard as he could, raised it behind\nhim. The head of his enemy snapped round, but too late. There was a\nhollow bonk of metal on metal as sword smashed into helmet, leaving a\ndeep dent and sending the tall man sprawling. His head bounced once\nagainst the road, foot still caught in one stirrup, then he came free and\ntumbled over and over on the grass, arms and legs flopping. His riderless\nhorse galloped on, eyes rolling at Logen as he passed.\n'Still alive.' Logen looked over his shoulder. Blacktoe was back in the\nsaddle and galloping after him, axe raised above his head, tangled hair\nflying out behind. The two other spearmen were with him, urging their\nhorses forwards, but there was still some distance between them. Logen\nlaughed. Perhaps he'd make it after all. He waved his sword at Blacktoe as\nthe road entered a wood in the valley's bottom.\n'I'm still alive!' he screamed at the top of his voice, and then his horse\npulled up so suddenly that Logen was almost flung over its head. It was\nonly by throwing one arm round its neck that he kept his seat at all. As soon\nas he fell back into the saddle he saw the problem, and it was a bad one.\nSeveral tree trunks had been hauled across the road, their branches\nchopped off and the stumps filed down to vicious points, sticking out in all\ndirections. Two more mailed Carls stood in front, spears at the ready. Even\nthe best of horsemen couldn't have jumped that barrier, and Logen wasn't\nthe best of horsemen. Bayaz and his apprentice had reached the same\ndecision. Both sat still on their horses before the barricade, the old man\nlooking puzzled, the young one simply scared.\nLogen fingered the grip of his sword and cast desperately around,\npeering into the trees for some way out. He saw more men now. Archers.\nOne, then two, then three of them, creeping slowly forward on both sides of\nthe road, arrows nocked and strings drawn back.\nLogen turned round in the saddle, but Blacktoe and his two companions\nwere trotting up, there was no escape that way. They reined in a few strides\naway, well out of reach of Logen's sword. His shoulders slumped. The\nchase was done. Blacktoe leaned over and spat some blood onto the ground.\n'Alright, Bloody-Nine, that's as far as you go.'\n'Funny thing,' muttered Logen, looking down at the long grey blade of\nthe sword, dashed and spattered with red. 'All that time I fought for Bethod"

'All that time I fought for Bethod\nagainst you, and now you fight for him against me. Seems we're never on\nthe same side, and he's the only winner. Funny thing.'\n'Aye,' mumbled Blacktoe through his bloody lips, 'funny.' But no one\nwas laughing. Blacktoe and his Carls had faces hard as death, Quai looked\non the verge of tears. Only Bayaz, for reasons beyond understanding, still\nhad his customary good humour. 'Alright, Ninefingers, get off the horse.\nBethod wants you alive, but he'll take you dead, if he has to. Down! Now!'\nLogen's thoughts began to turn to how they might escape, once he'd\ngiven up. Blacktoe wasn't like to make a mistake once he had them. Logen\nwould likely be kicked half to death for the fight he'd given them already, if\nthey didn't take his kneecaps off. They'd be trussed up tight like chickens\nfor the slaughter. He pictured himself flung down on the stones with half a\nmile of chain around him, Bethod smiling down from his throne, Calder and\nScale laughing, probably poking at him with something sharp.\nLogen looked around. He looked at the cold arrowheads and the cold\nspear-points, and the cold eyes of the men pointing them. There was no way\nout of this little spot.\n'Alright, you win.' Logen threw his sword down, point first. He had it in\nmind that it would bite into the soil and stand there, swaying back and forth,\nbut it toppled over and clattered against the dirt. It was that sort of day. He\nslowly swung one leg over the saddle and slid down into the road.\n'That's better. Now the rest of you.' Quai instantly slithered off his horse\nand stood there, glancing nervously up at Bayaz, but the Magus made no\nmove. Blacktoe frowned and hefted his axe. 'You too, old man.'\n'I prefer to ride.' Logen winced. That was not the right answer. Any\nmoment now Blacktoe would give the order. The bowstrings would sing\nand the First of the Magi would drop into the road, stuck full of arrows,\nprobably still with that infuriating smile on his dead face.\nBut the order never came. There was no word of command, no strange\nincantation, no arcane gestures. The air around Bayaz' shoulders seemed to\nshimmer, like the air above the land on a hot day, and Logen felt a strange\ntugging at his guts.\nThen the trees exploded in a wall of searing, blinding, white hot flame.\nTrunks burst and branches snapped with deafening cracks, venting plumes\nof brilliant fire and scalding steam. One burning arrow shot high up into the\nair over Logen's head, and then the archers were gone, boiled away into the\nfurnace.\nLogen choked and gasped, reeled back in shock and terror, arm up to\nward his face from the blistering heat.

The barricade was sending up great\ngouts of fire and blinding sparks, the two men who had been standing near\nwere rolling and thrashing, wreathed in hungry flames, their screams lost in\nthe deafening roar.\nThe horses plunged and reeled, snorting with mad fear. Blacktoe was\nflung to the ground for the second time, his flaming axe flying from his\nhands, and his horse stumbled and fell, crashing down on top of him. One\nof his companions was even less lucky—thrown straight into the sheets of\nfire by the road, his despairing cry quickly cut off. Only one stayed upright,\nand he was lucky enough to be wearing gloves. By some miracle he kept\nhold of the burning shaft of his spear.\nHow he had the presence of mind to charge with the world on fire\naround him, Logen would never know. Strange things can happen in a fight.\nHe chose Quai as his target, bearing down on him with a snarl, the flaming\nspear aimed at his chest. The witless apprentice stood there helpless, rooted\nto the spot. Logen barrelled into him, snatching up his sword, sending Quai\nrolling across the road with his hands over his head, then he chopped\nmindlessly at the horse's legs as it flashed past him.\nThe blade was torn from his fingers and went skittering away, then a\nhoof slammed into Logen's injured shoulder and clubbed him into the dirt.\nThe breath was knocked from him and the burning world span crazily\naround. His blow had its effect though. A few strides further down the road\nthe horses hacked front legs gave way and it stumbled, carried helplessly\nforward, tumbled and pitched into the flames, horse and rider vanishing\ntogether.\nLogen cast about on the ground for the sword. Sizzling leaves whipped\nacross the road, stinging his face and his hands. The heat was a great weight\npressing down on him, pulling the sweat out of his skin. He found the\nbloody grip of the sword, seized hold of it with his torn fingers. He lurched\nup, staggered round, shouting meaningless sounds of fury, but there was no\none left to fight. The flames were gone, as suddenly as they'd arrived,\nleaving Logen coughing and blinking in the curling smoke.\nThe silence seemed complete after the roaring noise, the gentle breeze\nfelt icy cold. A wide circle of the trees around them had been reduced to\ncharred and shattered stumps, as though they had burned for hours. The\nbarricade was a sagging heap of grey ash and black splinters. Two corpses\nlay sprawled nearby, barely recognisable as men, burned down to the bones.\nThe blackened blades of their spears lay in the road, the shafts vanished. Of\nthe archers there was no sign at all. They were soot blown away on the\nwind. Quai lay motionless on his face with his hands over his head, and\nbeyond him Blacktoe's horse lay sprawled out on its side, one leg silently\ntwitching, the others still.\n'Well,' said Bayaz, the muffled noise making Logen jump.

His horse stood there, calm and obedient. It hadn't moved the whole\ntime. 'There now, Master Quai, do you see what can be achieved with a\nproper understanding of plants?'\nBayaz sounded calm, but his hands were trembling. Trembling badly.\nHe looked haggard, ill, old, like a man who'd dragged a cart ten miles.\nLogen stared at him, swaying silently back and forth, the sword dangling\nfrom his hand.\n'So that's Art, is it?' His voice sounded very small and far away.\nBayaz wiped the sweat from his face. 'Of a sort. Hardly very subtle.\nStill,' and he poked at one of the charred bodies with his boot, 'subtlety is\nwasted on the Northmen.' He grimaced, rubbed at his sunken eyes and\npeered up the road. 'Where the hell did those horses get to?'\nLogen heard a ragged groan from the direction of Blacktoe's fallen\nmount. He stumbled towards it, tripped and fell to his knees, stumbled\ntowards it again. His shoulder was a ball of pain, his left arm numb, his\nfingers ripped and bleeding, but Blacktoe was in worse shape. Much worse.\nHe was propped up on his elbows, legs crushed under his horse right to the\nhips, hands burned to swollen tatters. He had a look of profound\npuzzlement on his bloody face as he tried, unsuccessfully, to drag himself\nfrom under the horse.\n'You've fucking killed me,' he whispered, staring open-mouthed at the\nwreckage of his hands. 'I'm all done. I'll never make it back, and even if I\ncould, what for?' He gave a despairing laugh. 'Bethod ain't half so merciful\nas he used to be. Better you kill me now, before it starts to hurt. Better all\nround.' And he slumped back and lay in the road.\nLogen looked up at Bayaz, but there was no help there. 'I'm not much at\nhealing,' snapped the wizard, glancing round at the circle of blasted stumps.\n'I told you we tend to specialise.' He closed his eyes and bent over, hands\nresting on his knees, breathing hard.\nLogen thought of the floor in Bethod's hall, and the two princes,\nlaughing and poking. 'Alright,' he muttered, standing up and hefting the\nsword. 'Alright.'\nBlacktoe smiled. 'You were right, Ninefingers. I never should have knelt\nto Bethod. Never. Shit on him and his Feared. It would have been better to\ndie up in the mountains, fighting him to the last. There might have been\nsomething fine in that. I just had enough. You can see that, can't you?'\n'I can see that,' muttered Logen. 'I've had enough myself.'\n'Something fine,' said Blacktoe, staring far up into the grey skies, 'I just\nhad enough. So I reckon I earned this. Fair is fair.' He lifted his chin. 'Well\nthen. Get it done, lad.'\nLogen raised the sword."

Get it done, lad.'\nLogen raised the sword.\n'I'm glad it's you, Ninefingers,' hissed Blacktoe through gritted teeth, 'for\nwhat it's worth.'\n'I'm not.' Logen swung the blade down.\nThe scorched stumps were still smouldering, smoke curling up into the\nair, but all was cold now. Logen's mouth tasted salty, like blood. Perhaps he\nbit his tongue somewhere. Perhaps it was someone else's. He threw the\nsword down and it bounced and clattered, shedding red specks across the\ndirt. Quai gaped around for a moment, then he folded up and coughed puke\ninto the road. Logen stared down at Blacktoe's headless corpse. 'That was a\ngood man. Better than me.'\n'History is littered with dead good men.' Bayaz knelt stiffly and picked\nup the sword, wiped the blade on Blacktoe's coat, then he squinted up the\nroad, peering through the haze of smoke. 'We should be moving. Others\nmight be on their way.'\nLogen looked at his bloody hands, slowly turning them over and over.\nThey were his hands, no doubt. There was the missing finger. 'Nothing's\nchanged,' he mumbled to himself.\nBayaz straightened up, brushing the dirt from his knees. 'When has it\never?' He held out the sword out to Logen, hilt first. 'I think you'll still be\nneeding this.'\nLogen stared at the blade for a moment. It was clean, dull grey, just as it\nhad always been. Unlike him, it showed not so much as a scratch from the\nhard use it had seen that day. He didn't want it back. Not ever.\nBut he took it anyway.\nPART II\n'Life—the way it\nreally is—is a battle not\nbetween good and bad, but\nbetween bad and worse'\nJoseph Brodsky\nWhat Freedom Looks Like\n« ^ »\nThe point of the shovel bit into the ground with the sharp scrape of metal on\nearth. An all too familiar sound. It didn't bite in far, for all the effort put\nbehind it, as the soil was rocky hard and baked by the sun.\nBut she wasn't to be deterred by a little hard soil.\nShe had dug too many holes, and in ground worse for digging than this.\nWhen the fighting is over, you dig, if you're still alive. You dig graves\nfor your dead comrades. A last mark of respect, however little you might\nhave had for them. You dig as deep as you can be bothered, you dump them\nin, you cover them up, they rot away and are forgotten. That's the way it's\nalways been.\nShe flicked her shoulder and a sent a shovelful of sandy soil flying. Her\neyes followed the grains of dirt and little stones as they broke apart in the\nair, then fell across the face of one of the soldiers. One eye stared at her\nreproachfully. The other had one of her arrows snapped off in it. A couple of\nflies were buzzing lazily around his face. There would be no burial for him,\nthe graves were for her people. He and his bastard friends could lie out in\nthe merciless sun."

He and his bastard friends could lie out in\nthe merciless sun.\nAfter all, the vultures have to eat.\nThe blade of the shovel swished through the air and bit again into the\nsoil. Another clump of dirt tumbled away. She straightened up and wiped\nthe sweat from her face. She squinted up at the sky. The sun was blazing,\nstraight above, sucking whatever moisture remained out of the dusty\nlandscape, drying the blood on the rocks. She looked at the two graves\nbeside her. One more to go. She would finish this one, throw the earth on\ntop of those three fools, rest for a moment, then away.\nOthers would be coming for her soon enough.\nShe stuck the shovel into the earth, took hold of the water skin and\npulled the stopper out. She took a few lukewarm swallows, even allowed\nherself the luxury of pouring a trickle out into her grimy hand and splashing\nit on her face. The early deaths of her comrades had at least put a stop to the\nendless squabbling over water.\nThere would be plenty to go round now.\n'Water…' gasped the soldier by the rocks. It was surprising, but he was\nstill alive. Her arrow had missed his heart but it had killed him still—just a\nlittle less quickly than she had intended. He had managed to drag himself as\nfar as the rocks, but his crawling days were over. The stones around him\nwere coated in dark blood. The heat and that arrow would do for him soon,\nhowever tough he was.\nShe wasn't thirsty, but there was water to spare and she wouldn't be able\nto carry it all. She took a few more swallows, letting it slosh out of her\nmouth and down her neck. A rare treat out here in the Badlands, to let water\nfall. Shining drops spattered onto the dry earth, turning it dark. She splashed\nsome more on her face, licked her lips, and looked over at the soldier.\n'Mercy…' he croaked, one hand clasped to his chest where the arrow\nwas sticking out of it, the other stretched weakly towards her.\n'Mercy? Hah!' She pushed the stopper back into the skin, then tossed it\ndown next to the grave. 'Don't you know who I am?' She grabbed hold of\nthe handle of the shovel, the point of its blade bit once more into the earth.\n'Ferro Maljinn!' came a voice from somewhere behind her, 'I know who\nyou are!'\nA most unwelcome development.\nShe swung the shovel again, mind racing. Her bow was lying just out of\nreach on the ground by the first grave she had dug. She threw some dirt\naway, her sweating shoulders prickling at the unseen presence. She glanced\nover at the dying soldier. He was staring at a point behind her, and that gave\nher a good idea where this new arrival was standing.\nShe dug the point of the shovel in again, then let go and sprang forward\nout of the hole, rolling across the dirt, snatching up her bow as she moved,\nnotching an arrow, drawing back the string in one smooth motion. An old\nman was standing about ten strides away. He was making no move forward,"

He was just standing, looking at her with a benign\nsmile.\nShe let the arrow fly.\nNow Ferro was about as deadly with a bow as it's possible to be. The\nten dead soldiers could have testified to that, if they'd been able. Six of\nthem had her arrows sticking out of them, and in that fight she hadn't\nmissed once. She couldn't remember missing at close range, however\nquickly the shot had been taken, and she'd killed men ten times further\naway than this smiling old bastard was now.\nBut this time she missed.\nThe arrow seemed to curve in the air. A bad feather maybe, but it still\ndidn't seem quite right. The old man didn't flinch, not even a hair. He simply\nstood, smiling, exactly where he'd always stood, and the arrow missed him\nby a few inches and disappeared off down the hillside.\nAnd that gave everyone time to consider the situation.\nHe was a strange one, this old man. Very dark-skinned, black as coal,\nwhich meant he was from the far south, across the wide and shelterless\ndesert. That's a journey not lightly taken, and Ferro had rarely seen such\npeople. Tall and thin with long, sinewy arms and a simple robe wrapped\nround him. There were strange bangles round his wrists, stacked up so they\ncovered half his fore-arms, glittering dark and light in the savage sun.\nHis hair was a mass of grey ropes about his face, some hanging down as\nlow as his waist, and there was a grey stubble on his lean, pointed jaw. He\nhad a big water skin wrapped around his chest, and a bunch of leather bags\nhanging from a belt around his waist. Nothing else. No weapon. That was\nthe strangest thing of all, for a man out here in the Badlands. No one came\nto this god-forsaken place except those who were running, and those sent to\nhunt them. In either case, they should be well armed.\nHe was no soldier of Gurkhul, he was no scum come looking for the\nmoney on her head. He was no bandit, no escaped slave. What was he then?\nAnd why was he here? He must have come for her. He could be one of\nthem.\nAn Eater.\nWho else would wander the Badlands without a weapon? She hadn't\nrealised they wanted her that badly.\nHe stood there motionless, the old man, smiling at her. She reached\nslowly for another arrow, and his eyes followed her without any worry.\n'That really isn't necessary,' he said, in a slow, deep voice.\nShe nocked the arrow to her bow. The old man didn't move. She\nshrugged her shoulders and took her time aiming. The old man smiled on,\nnot a care in the world. She let the arrow fly. It missed him by a few inches\nagain, this time on the other side, and shot off down the hillside.\nOnce was a possibility, she had to admit that, but twice was wrong.

The old\nfool should have been stuck through and bleeding out his last into the stony\nsoil. Now, simply by standing still and smiling, he seemed to be saying,\n'You know less than you think. I know more.'\nThat was very galling.\n'Who are you, you old bastard?'\n'They call me Yulwei.'\n'Old bastard will do for you!' She tossed her bow down on the ground,\nlet her arms drop to her sides so that her right hand was hidden from him by\nher body. She twisted her wrist and the curved knife dropped out of her\nsleeve and into her waiting palm. There are many ways to kill a man, and if\none way fails you must try another.\nFerro had never been one to give up at the first stumble.\nYulwei began to move slowly towards her, his bare feet padding on the\nrocks, bangles jingling softly together. That was very strange, now she\nthought about it. If he made a noise every time he moved, how had he\nmanaged to sneak up on her?\n'What do you want?'\n'I want to help you.' He came forward, until he was just over an arm's\nlength away, then he stopped and stood, grinning at her.\nNow Ferro was fast as a snake with a knife and twice as deadly, as the\nlast of those soldiers could have testified, had he been able. The blade was a\nshining blur in the air, swung with all her strength and all her fury behind it.\nIf he had been standing where she thought he was, his head would have\nbeen hanging off. Only he wasn't. He was standing about a stride to the left.\nShe threw herself at him with a fighting scream, ramming the glittering\npoint of the knife into his heart. But she stabbed only air. He was back\nwhere he had been before, motionless and smiling all the while. Very\nstrange. She padded round him, cautious, sandaled feet scuffing in the dust,\nleft hand circling in the air in front of her, right hand gripped tight round the\nhandle of the knife. She had to be careful—there was magic here.\n'There is no need to get angry. I am here to help.'\n'Fuck your help,' she hissed back at him.\n'But you need it, and badly.

'Then I'll give them to the\nvultures.'\n'Not this time. They are not alone. They have help.' On the word 'help'\nhis deep voice dropped even lower.\nFerro frowned. 'Priests?'\n'Yes, and more besides.' His eyes went very wide. 'An Eater,' he\nwhispered. 'They mean to take you alive. The Emperor wants to make an\nexample of you. He has it in mind to put you on display.'\nShe snorted. 'Fuck the Emperor.'\n'I heard you already did.'\nShe growled and raised the knife again, but it was not a knife. There"

There\nwas a hissing snake in her hand, a deadly snake, with its mouth open to bite.\n'Ugh!' She threw it on the ground, stamped her foot down on its head, but\nshe stamped on her knife instead. The blade snapped with a sharp crack.\n'They will catch you,' said the old man. 'They will catch you, and they\nwill break your legs with hammers in the city square, so you can never run\nagain. Then they will parade you through the streets of Shaffa, naked,\nsitting backwards on an ass, with your hair shaved off, while the people line\nthe streets and shout insults at you.'\nShe frowned at him, but Yulwei did not stop. 'They will starve you to\ndeath in a cage before the palace, cooking in the hot sun, while the good\npeople of Gurkhul taunt you and spit on you and throw dung at you through\nthe bars. Perhaps they will give you piss to drink, if you are lucky. When\nyou finally die they will let you rot, and the flies will eat you bit by bit, and\nall the other slaves will see what freedom looks like, and decide they are\nbetter off as they are.'\nFerro was bored with this. Let them come, and the Eater too. She\nwouldn't die in a cage. She would cut her own throat, if it came to that. She\nturned her back on him with a scowl and snatched up the shovel, started\ndigging away furiously at the last grave. Soon it was deep enough.\nDeep enough for the scum who'd be rotting in it.\nShe turned around. Yulwei was kneeling down by the dying soldier,\ngiving him water from the skin round his chest.\n'Fuck!' she shouted, striding over, her fingers locked around the handle\nof the shovel.\nThe old man got to his feet as she came close. 'Mercy…' croaked the\nsoldier, stretching out his hand.\n'I'll give you mercy!' The edge of the shovel bit deep into the soldier's\nskull. The body twitched briefly then was still. She turned to the old man\nwith a look of triumph. He stared back sadly. There was something in his\neyes. Pity, maybe.\n'What do you want, Ferro Maljinn?'\n'What?'\n'Why did you do that?' Yulwei pointed down at the dead man. 'What do\nyou want?'\n'Vengeance.' She spat out the word.\n'On all of them? On the whole nation of Gurkhul? Every man, woman\nand child?'\n'All of them!'\nThe old man looked round the corpses. 'Then you must be very happy\nwith today's work.'\nShe forced a smile onto her face. 'Yes.'

Or ever could be.' He sat down, cross-legged on a\nrock.\nShe stared at him for a moment, confused. Then the anger bubbled up\nagain, hot and reassuring. 'If you came to help me, you can help me bury\nthem!' She pointed over at the three bloody corpses, lined up next to the\ngraves.\n'Oh no. That is your work.'\nShe turned away from the old man, cursing under her breath, and moved\nover to her one-time companions. She took Shebed's corpse under the arms\nand hauled him over to the first grave, his heels making two little grooves in\nthe dust. When she made it to the hole she rolled him in. Alugai was next. A\nstream of dry soil ran over him as he came to rest in the bottom of his\ngrave.\nShe turned to Nasar's carcass. He had been killed by a sword cut across\nthe face. Ferro thought it was something of an improvement to his looks.\n'That one looks a good sort,' said Yulwei.\n'Nasar.' She laughed without amusement. 'A raper, a thief, a coward.'\nShe hawked up some phlegm and spat into his dead face. It splattered softly\nagainst his forehead. 'Much the worst of the three.' She looked down at the\ngraves. 'But they were all of them shit.'\n'Nice company you keep.'\n'The hunted don't have the luxury of choosing their companions.' She\nstared at Nasar's bloody face. 'You take what's offered.'\n'If you disliked them so much, why don't you leave them for the\nvultures, like you have these others?' Yulwei swept his arm over the broken\nsoldiers on the ground.\n'You bury your own.' She kicked Nasar into the hole. He rolled forward,\narms flopping, and dropped into the grave face down. 'That's the way it's\nalways been.'\nShe grabbed hold of the shovel and started to heap the stony earth onto\nhis back. She worked in silence, the sweat building up on her face, then\ndripping off onto the ground. Yulwei watched her as the holes filled up.\nThree more piles of dirt in the wasteland. She threw the shovel away and it\nbounced off one of the corpses and clattered among the stones. A small\ncloud of black flies buzzed angrily off the body, then returned.\nFerro picked up her bow and arrows and slung them over her shoulder.\nShe took the water skin, checked its weight carefully, then shouldered that\nalso. Then she picked over the bodies of the soldiers. One of them, he\nlooked like the leader, had a fine curved sword. He hadn't even managed to\ndraw it before her arrow had caught him in the throat.

It was very good:\nwell balanced, the long blade glittering deadly sharp, bright metal on the\nhilt catching the sun. He had a knife as well that matched it. She took the\nweapons and stuck them through her belt.\nShe picked over the other bodies, but there wasn't much to take. She cut\nher arrows from the corpses where she could. She found some coins and\ntossed them away. They would only weigh her down, and what would she\nbuy out here in the Badlands? Dirt?\nThat was all there was, and it was free.\nThey had a few scraps of food with them, but not enough even for\nanother day. That meant there must be others, probably lots of them, and not\nfar away. Yulwei was telling the truth, but it made no difference to her.\nShe turned and started to walk southward, down off the hill and towards\nthe great desert, leaving the old man behind.\n'That's the wrong way,' he said.\nShe stopped, squinting at him in the bright sun. 'Aren't the soldiers\ncoming?'\nYulwei's eyes sparkled. 'There are many ways of staying unnoticed,\neven out here in the Badlands.'\nShe looked to the north, out over the featureless plain below. Out\ntowards Gurkhul. There wasn't a hill, or a tree, or scarcely a bush for miles.\nNowhere to hide. 'Unnoticed, even by an Eater?'\nThe old man laughed. 'Especially by those arrogant swine. They're not\nhalf as clever as they think they are. How do you think I got here? I came\nthrough them, between them, around them. I go where I please, and I take\nwho I please with me.'\nShe shaded her eyes with her hand, and squinted southward. The desert\nstretched away into the far distance, and beyond. Ferro could survive here\nin the wilderness, just about, but out there in that crucible of changing sands\nand merciless heat?\nThe old man seemed to read her thoughts. 'There are always the endless\nsands. I have crossed them before. It can be done. But not by you.'\nHe was right, damn him. Ferro was lean and tough as a bowstring, but\nthat just meant she would walk in circles a little longer before pitching on\nher face. The desert was preferable to the cage before the palace as a place\nto die, but not by much. She wanted to stay alive.\nThere were still things to do.\nThe old man sat there, cross-legged, smiling. What was he? Ferro\ntrusted no one, but if he meant to deliver her to the Emperor, he could have\nknocked her on the head while she was digging, instead of announcing his\narrival. He had magic, she had seen that for herself, and some chance was\nbetter than none.\nBut what would he want in return? The world had never given Ferro\nanything for free, and she didn't expect it to begin now. She narrowed her\neyes. 'What do you want from me, Yulwei?'\nThe old man laughed. That laugh was becoming very annoying. 'Let us\njust say that I will have done you a favour. Later on, you can do me one in"

Later on, you can do me one in\nreturn.'\nThat answer was horribly thin on the details, but when your life's on the\ntable you have to take whatever's offered. She hated to place herself in the\npower of another, but it seemed she had no choice.\nNot if she wanted to live out the week, that is.\n'What do we do?'\n'We must wait for nightfall.' Yulwei glanced at the twisted bodies\nscattered about the ground, and wrinkled his nose. 'But perhaps not here.'\nFerro shrugged and sat herself down on the middle grave. 'Here will do,'\nshe said, 'I've a mind to watch the vultures eat.'\nOverhead the clear night sky was scattered with bright stars, and the air had\nturned cool, cold even. Down on the dark and dusty plain below, fires were\nburning, a curved line of fires that seemed to hem them in against the edge\nof the desert. She, Yulwei, the ten corpses and the three graves were trapped\non the hillside. Tomorrow, as the first light crept over the arid land, the\nsoldiers would leave those fires and creep carefully towards the hills. If\nFerro was still there when they arrived, she would be killed for sure, or\nworse still captured. She could not fight that many on her own, even\nsupposing there was no Eater with them.\nShe hated to admit it, but her life was in Yulweis hands now.\nHe squinted up at the starry sky. 'It is time,' he said.\nThey scrambled down the rocky hillside in the darkness, picking their\nway carefully among the boulders and the odd, scrubby, half-dead bush.\nNorthward, towards Gurkhul. Yulwei moved surprisingly fast and she was\nforced to half-run to keep up, eyes fixed on the ground to find her footing\namong the dry rocks. When they finally reached the base of the hill and she\nlooked up, she saw that Yulwei was leading her toward the left hand edge of\nthe line, where the fires were most numerous.\n'Wait,' she whispered, grabbing his shoulder. She pointed over to the\nright hand side. There were fewer fires there, and it would be easier to slip\nbetween them. 'What about that way?'\nShe could just see Yulwei's teeth smiling white in the starlight. 'Oh no,\nFerro Maljinn. That is where most of the soldiers are… and our other\nfriend.' He was making no attempt to keep his voice down, and it was\nmaking her jumpy. 'That is where they expect you to come through, if you\nchoose to go north. But they do not expect you. They think you will go\nsouth into the desert to die, rather than risk being captured, as indeed you\nwould have done, had I not been here.'\nYulwei turned and moved off and she crept after him, keeping low to the\nground. As they drew nearer to the fires she saw that the old man had been\nright. There were figures sitting around some of them, but they were thinly\nspread. The old man strode confidently toward four fires on the far left,\nonly one of them manned. He made no effort to stay low, his bangles"

He made no effort to stay low, his bangles\njingled softly together, his bare feet flapped loud on the dry earth. They\nwere almost close enough to see the features of the three men round the fire.\nYulwei would surely be seen at any moment. She hissed at him to grab his\nattention, sure that she would be heard.\nYulwei turned round, looking puzzled in the faint light from the flames.\n'What?' he said. She winced, waiting for the soldiers to leap up, but they\nchattered on regardless. Yulwei looked over at them. 'They will not see us,\nnor hear us either, unless you start shouting in their ears. We are safe.' He\nturned and walked on, giving the soldiers a wide berth. Ferro followed, still\nkeeping low and quiet, if only out of habit.\nAs Ferro came closer she began to make out the words of the soldier's\nconversation. She slowed, listening. She turned. She started to move\ntowards the fire. Yulwei looked round. 'What are you doing?' he asked.\nFerro looked at the three of them. A big, tough-looking veteran, a thin,\nweaselly type, and an honest-seeming young man, who didn't look much\nlike a soldier. Their weapons were lying around, sheathed, wrapped up,\nunready. She circled them warily, listening.\n'They say she's not right in the head,' the thin one was whispering at the\nyoung one, trying to scare him, 'they say she's killed a hundred men, or\nmore. If you're a good looking fella, she cuts your fruits off while you're\nstill alive,' he grabbed hold of his crotch, 'and eats them in front of you!'\n'Ah, stop your mouth,' said the big one, 'she won't be coming near us.'\nHe pointed over to where the fires were sparser, his voice dropping to a\nwhisper. 'She'll be going to him, if she comes this way at all.'\n'Well, I hope she doesn't,' said the young one, 'live and let live, say I.'\nThe thin man frowned. 'And what about all the good men she's killed?\nAnd women and children too? Shouldn't they have been let live?' Ferro's\nteeth ground together. She'd never killed children, that she could think of.\n'Well, it's a shame for them, of course. I'm not saying she shouldn't be\ncaught.' The young soldier glanced around nervously. 'Just maybe not by\nus.'\nThe big man let go a laugh at that, but the thin one didn't look amused.\n'You a coward?'\n'No!' said the young man, angrily, 'but I got a wife and a family\ndepending on me, and I could do without being killed out here, that's all.'\nHe grinned. 'We're expecting another child. Hoping for a son this time.'\nThe big man nodded. 'My son's nearly grown now. They get old so\nquick.'\nTalk of children, and families, and hopes only made the fury in Ferro's\nchest squeeze harder. Why should they be allowed a life, when she had\nnothing?

'Did you hear something?'\nThe big one laughed. 'I think I heard you shit yourself.' The thin one\nchuckled to himself, the young man smiled, embarrassed. Ferro crept right\nup behind him. She was just a foot or two away, brightly lit by the fire, but\nnone of the soldiers even glanced at her. She raised the knife.\n'Ferro!' shouted Yulwei. The young man sprang to his feet, he peered out\nacross the dark plain, squinting, brow furrowed. He looked Ferro right in\nthe face, but his eyes were focused far behind her. She could smell his\nbreath. The blade of the knife glittered an inch or less from his stubbly\nthroat.\nNow. Now was the time. She could kill him quickly, and take the other\ntwo as well before the alarm was raised. She knew she could do it. They\nwere unprepared, and she was ready. Now was the time.\nBut her hand didn't move.\n'What's got up your arse?' asked the big soldier. 'There's nothing out\nthere.'\n'Could've sworn I heard something,' said the young man, still looking\nright in her face.\n'Wait!' shouted the thin one, jumping to his feet and pointing. 'There she\nis! Right in front of you!' Ferro froze for an instant, staring at him, then he\nand the big man started to laugh. The young soldier looked sheepish, turned\naround and sat down.\n'I thought I heard something, that's all.'\n'There's no one out there,' said the big man. Ferro began to back slowly\naway. She felt sick, her mouth full of sour spit, her head thumping. She\npushed the knife back into its sheath, turned and stumbled off with Yulwei\nfollowing silently behind.\nWhen the light of the fires and the sound of the talking had faded into\nthe distance she stopped and dropped down on the hard ground. A cold\nwind blew up across the barren plain. It blew stinging dust in her face, but\nshe hardly noticed. The hate and the fury were gone, for the time being, but\nthey had left a hole, and she had nothing else to fill it with. She felt empty\nand cold and sick and alone. She hugged herself, rocking slowly back and\nforth, and closed her eyes. But the darkness held no comfort.\nThen she felt the old man's hand press onto her shoulder.\nNow normally she would have twisted away, thrown him off, killed him\nif she could. But the strength was all gone. She looked up, blinking. 'There's\nnothing left of me. What am I?' She pressed one hand on her chest, but she\nbarely felt it. 'I have nothing inside.'\n'Well. It's strange that you should say that.' Yulwei smiled up at the\nstarry sky. 'I was just starting to think there might be something in there\nworth saving.'\nThe King's Justice\n« ^ »"

'I was just starting to think there might be something in there\nworth saving.'\nThe King's Justice\n« ^ »\nAs soon as he reached the Square of Marshals, Jezal realised there was\nsomething wrong. It was never half this busy for a meeting of the Open\nCouncil. He glanced over the knots of finely dressed people as he hurried\nby, slightly late and out of breath from his long training session: voices\nwere hushed, faces tense and expectant.\nHe shouldered his way through the crowd to the Lord's Round, glancing\nsuspiciously up at the guards flanking the inlaid doors. They at least seemed\nthe same as ever, their heavy visors giving nothing away. He crossed the\nante-chamber, vivid tapestries flapping slightly in the draught, slipped\nthrough the inner doors and passed into the vast, cool space beyond. His\nfootsteps made tapping echoes in the gilded dome as he hurried down the\naisle towards the high table. Jalenhorm was standing beneath one of the tall\nwindows, face splashed with coloured light from the stained glass, frowning\nat a bench with a metal rail along its base which had been placed to one side\nof the floor.\n'What's going on?'\n'Haven't you heard?' Jalenhorm's voice was whispery with excitement.\n'Hoffs let it be known there'll be some great matter to discuss.'\n'What is it? Angland? The Northmen?'\nThe big man shook his head. 'Don't know, but we'll soon see.'\nJezal frowned. 'I don't like surprises.' His eye came to rest on the\nmysterious bench. 'What's that for?'\nAt that moment the great doors were swung open and a stream of\ncouncillors began to flood down the aisle. The usual mixture, Jezal\nsupposed, if a little more purposeful. The younger sons, the paid\nrepresentatives… he caught his breath. There was a tall man at the front,\nrichly dressed even in this august company, with a weighty golden chain\nacross his shoulders and a weighty frown across his face.\n'Lord Brock himself,' whispered Jezal.\n'And there's Lord Isher.' Jalenhorm nodded at a sedate old man just\nbehind Brock, 'and Heugen, and Barezin. It's something big. It has to be.'\nJezal took a deep breath as four of the Union's most powerful noblemen\narranged themselves on the front row. He had never seen the Open Council\nhalf so well attended. On the councillors' half-circle of benches there was\nbarely an empty seat. High above them, the public gallery was an unbroken\nring of nervous faces.\nNow Hoff blustered through the doors and down the aisle, and he was\nnot alone. On his right a tall man flowed along, slender and proud-looking\nwith a long, spotless white coat and a shock of white hair. Arch Lector Sult.\nOn his left walked another man, leaning heavily on a stick, slightly bent in a\nrobe of black and gold with a long grey beard. High Justice Marovia.

The head of\nhis Majesty's Inquisition swept into a high chair on one side of him, smiling\nfaintly to himself. High Justice Marovia lowered himself slowly into\nanother, frowning all the while. The volume of the anxious whispering in\nthe hall rose a step, the faces of the great magnates on the front row were\ngrim and suspicious. The Announcer took his place before the table, not the\nusual brightly dressed imbecile, but a dark, bearded man with a barrel chest.\nHe lifted his staff high, then beat it against the tiles, fit to wake the dead.\n'I call this meeting of the Open Council of the Union to order!' he\nbellowed. The hubbub gradually died away.\n'There is but one matter for discussion this morning,' said the Lord\nChamberlain, peering sternly at the house from beneath his heavy brows, 'a\nmatter of the King's Justice.' There were scattered mutterings. 'A matter\nconcerning the royal licence for trade in the city of Westport.' The noise\nincreased: angry whispers, uncomfortable shufflings of noble arses on their\nbenches, the familiar scratching of quills on the great ledgers. Jezal saw\nLord Brock's brows draw together, the corners of Lord Heugen's mouth turn\ndown. They did not seem to like the taste of this. The Lord Chamberlain\nsniffed and took a swig of wine, waiting for the muttering to die away. 'I am\nnot best qualified to speak on this matter, however—'\n'No indeed!' snapped Lord Isher sharply, shifting in his seat on the front\nrow with a scowl.\nHoff fixed the old man with his eye. 'So I call on a man who is! My\ncolleague from the Closed Council, Arch Lector Sult.'\n'The Open Council recognises Arch Lector Sult!' thundered the\nAnnouncer, as the head of the Inquisition made his graceful way down the\nsteps of the dais and onto the tiled floor, smiling pleasantly at the angry\nfaces turned towards him.\n'My Lords,' he began, in a slow, musical voice, ushering his words out\ninto space with smooth movements of his hands, 'for the past seven years,\never since our glorious victory in the war with Gurkhul, an exclusive royal\nlicence for trade in the city of Westport has been in the hands of the\nhonourable Guild of Mercers.'\n'And a fine job they've done of it!' shouted Lord Heugen.\n'They won us that war!' growled Barezin, pounding the bench beside\nhim with a meaty fist.\n'A fine job!'\n'Fine!' came the cries.\nThe Arch Lector nodded as he waited for the noise to fade. 'Indeed they\nhave,' he said, pacing across the tiles like a dancer, his words scratching\ntheir way across the pages of the books. 'I would be the last to deny it. A\nfine job.'

There was a collective gasp.\n'A fine job of slighting the King's law!' Another gasp, louder.\nA fine job of high treason!' There was a storm of protest, of fists shaken\nin the air and papers thrown to the floor. Livid faces stared down from the\npublic gallery, florid ones ranted and bellowed from the benches before the\nhigh table. Jezal stared about him, unsure if he could have heard correctly.\n'How dare you, Sult!' Lord Brock roared at the Arch Lector as he\nswished back up the steps of the dais, a faint smile clinging to his lips.\n'We demand proof!' bellowed Lord Heugen. 'We demand justice!'\n'The King's Justice!' came cries from the back.\n'You must supply us with proof!' shouted Isher, as the noise began to\nfade.\nThe Arch Lector twitched out his white gown, the fine material\nbillowing around him as he swung himself smoothly back into his chair. 'Oh\nbut that is our intention, Lord Isher!'\nThe heavy bolt of a small side door was flung back with an echoing\nbang. There was a rustling as Lords and proxies twisted round, stood up,\nsquinted over to see what was happening. People in the public gallery\npeered out over the parapet, leaning dangerously far in their eagerness to\nsee. The hall fell quiet. Jezal swallowed. There was a scraping, tapping,\nclinking sound beyond the doorway, then a strange and sinister procession\nemerged from the darkness.\nSand dan Glokta came first, limping as always and leaning heavily on\nhis cane, but with his head held high and a twisted, toothless grin on his\nhollow face. Three men shuffled behind him, chained together by their\nhands and bare feet, clinking and rattling their way towards the high table.\nTheir heads were shaved bare and they were dressed in brown sackcloth.\nThe clothing of the penitent. Confessed traitors.\nThe first of the prisoners was licking his lips, eyes darting here and\nthere, pale with terror. The second, shorter and thicker-set, was stumbling,\ndragging his left leg behind him, hunched over with his mouth hanging\nopen. As Jezal watched, a thin line of pink drool dangled from his lip and\nspattered on the tiles. The third man, painfully thin and with huge dark rings\nround his eyes, stared slowly around, blinking, eyes wide but apparently\ntaking nothing in. Jezal recognised the man behind the three prisoners\nstraight away: the big albino from that night in the street. Jezal rocked his\nweight from one foot to the other, feeling suddenly cold and uncomfortable.\nThe purpose of the bench was now made clear. The three prisoners\nslumped down on it, the albino knelt and snapped their manacles shut\naround the rail along its base. The chamber was entirely silent. Every eye\nwas fixed on the crippled Inquisitor, and his three prisoners.\n'Our investigation began some months ago,' said Arch Lector Sult,\nimmensely smug at having the assembly so completely under his control.

Who could have thought then, that such a little matter would lead\nus here? Who would suppose that the roots of treason could run so very\ndeep?'\n'Indeed,' said the Lord Chamberlain impatiently, looking up from his\ngoblet. 'Inquisitor Glokta, the floor is yours.'\nThe Announcer struck his staff on the tiles. 'The Open Council of the\nUnion recognises Sand dan Glokta, Inquisitor Exempt!'\nThe cripple waited politely for the scratching of the clerk's quills to\nfinish, leaning on his cane in the centre of the floor, seemingly unmoved by\nthe importance of the occasion. 'Rise and face the Open Council,' he said,\nturning to the first of his prisoners.\nThe terrified man sprang up, his chains rattling, licking his pale lips,\ngoggling at the faces of the Lords in the front row. 'Your name?' demanded\nGlokta.\n'Salem Rews.'\nJezal felt a catch in his throat. Salem Rews? He knew the man! His\nfather had had dealings with him in the past, at one time he had been a\nregular visitor to their estate! Jezal studied the terrified, shaven-headed\ntraitor with increasing horror. He cast his mind back to the plump, well-\ndressed merchant, always ready with a joke. It was him, no doubt. Their\neyes met for an instant and Jezal looked anxiously away. His father had\ntalked with that man in their hallway! Had shaken hands with him!\nAccusations of treason are like illnesses—you can catch them just by being\nin the same room! His eyes were drawn inevitably back to that unfamiliar,\nyet horribly familiar face. How dare he be a traitor, the bastard?\n'You are a member of the honourable Guild of Mercers?' continued\nGlokta, putting a sneering accent into the word 'honourable'.\n'I was,' mumbled Rews.\n'What was your role within the Guild?' The shaven-headed Mercer\nstared desperately about him. 'Your role?' demanded Glokta, his voice\ntaking on a hard edge.\n'I conspired to defraud the King!' cried the merchant, wringing his\nhands. A wave of shock ran round the hall. Jezal swallowed sour spit. He\nsaw Sult smirking across at High Justice Marovia. The old man's face was\nstony blank, but his fists were clenched tight on the table before him. 'I\ncommitted treason! For money! I smuggled, and I bribed, and I lied… we\nwere all at it!'\n'All at it!' Glokta leered round at the assembly. 'And if any of you\nshould doubt it, we have ledgers, and we have documents, and we have\nnumbers. There is a room in the House of Questions stuffed with them. A\nroom full of secrets, and guilt, and lies.' He slowly shook his head. 'Sorry\nreading, I can tell you.'"

'It was him! Him!' The manacles rattled as he\nwaved his arm, spit flying from his mouth. There was another surge of\nangry voices, louder this time. Jezal watched the head of the middle\nprisoner sag and he slumped sideways, but the hulking albino grabbed him\nand hauled him back upright.\n'Wake up, Master Carpi!' shouted Glokta. The lolling head came slowly\nup. An unfamiliar face, strangely swollen and badly pocked with acne-scars.\nJezal noticed with disgust that his four front teeth were missing. Just like\nGlokta's.\n'You are from Talins, yes, in Styria?' The man nodded slowly, stupidly,\nlike someone half asleep. 'You are paid to kill people, yes?' He nodded\nagain. And you were hired to murder ten of his Majesty's subjects, among\nthem this confessed traitor, Salem Rews?' A trickle of blood ran slowly out\nfrom the man's nose and his eyes started to roll back in his head. The albino\nshook him by the shoulder and he came round, nodding groggily. 'What\nbecame of the other nine?' Silence. 'You killed them, did you not?' Another\nnod, a strange clicking sound coming from the prisoner's throat.\nGlokta frowned slowly around the rapt faces of the Council. 'Villem dan\nRobb, customs official, throat cut ear to ear.' He slid a finger across his neck\nand a woman in the gallery squealed. 'Solimo Scandi, Mercer, stabbed in\nthe back four times.' He thrust up four fingers, then pressed them to his\nstomach as though sickened. 'The bloody list goes on. All murdered, for\nnothing but a bigger profit. Who hired you?'\n'Him,' croaked the killer, turning his swollen face to look at the gaunt\nman with the glassy eyes, slumped on the bench next to him, heedless of his\nsurroundings. Glokta limped over, cane tapping on the tiles.\n'What is your name?'\nThe prisoner's head snapped up, his eyes focusing on the twisted face of\nthe Inquisitor above him. 'Gofred Hornlach!' he answered instantly, voice\nshrill.\n'You are a senior member of the Guild of Mercers?'\n'Yes!' he barked, blinking mindlessly up at Glokta.\n'One of Magister Kault's deputies, in fact?'\n'Yes!'\n'Have you conspired with other Mercers to defraud his Majesty the\nKing? Did you hire an assassin to murder ten of his Majesty's subjects?'"

His mouth slowly stopped moving.\n'Tell what they knew?' prompted the Inquisitor.\n'About the treasonous activities of the Guild!' the Mercer blurted, 'about\nour treasons!

No!'\nThe Inquisitor rapped his cane down before him and leaned forward.\n'Who gave the orders?' he hissed.\n'Magister Kault!' shouted Hornlach instantly, 'he gave the orders!' The\naudience gasped. Arch Lector Sult smirked a little wider. 'It was the\nMagister!' The quills scratched mercilessly. 'It was Kault! He gave the\norders! All the orders! Magister Kault!'\n'Thank you, Master Hornlach.'\n'The Magister! He gave the orders! Magister Kault! Kault! Kault!'\n'Enough!' snarled Glokta. His prisoner fell silent. The room was still.\nArch Lector Sult lifted his arm and pointed towards the three prisoners.\n'There is your proof, my Lords!'\n'This is a sham!' bellowed Lord Brock, leaping to his feet. 'This is an\ninsult!' Few voices joined him in support however, and those that did were\nhalf-hearted. Lord Heugen was notable for his careful silence, keenly\nstudying the fine leather of his shoes. Barezin had shrunk back into his seat,\nlooking half the size he had been a minute before. Lord Isher was staring\noff at the wall, fingering his heavy, golden chain, looking bored, as though\nthe fate of the Guild of Mercers was of interest to him no longer.\nBrock appealed to the High Justice himself, motionless in his tall chair\nat the high table. 'Lord Marovia, I beg of you! You are a reasonable man!\nDo not allow this… travesty!'\nThe hall fell silent, waiting for the old man's reply. He frowned and\nstroked his long beard. He glanced across at the grinning Arch Lector. He\ncleared his throat. 'I feel your pain, Lord Brock, indeed I do, but it seems\nthat this is not a day for reasonable men. The Closed Council has examined\nthe case and is well satisfied. My hands are tied.'\nBrock worked his mouth, tasting defeat. 'This is not justice!' he shouted,\nturning round to address his peers. 'These men have plainly been tortured!'\nArch Lector Sult's mouth twisted with scorn. 'How would you have us\ndeal with traitors and criminals?' he cried in a piercing voice. 'Would you\nraise a shield, Lord Brock, for the disloyal to hide behind?' He thumped the\ntable, as if it too might be guilty of high treason. 'I for one will not see our\ngreat nation handed over to its enemies! Neither enemies without, nor\nenemies within!'"

There was a\nsurge of anger and agreement from the floor, and calls for harsh measures\nand stiff penalties.\nBrock looked round for his allies on the front row, but found none. He\nbunched his fists. 'This is no justice!' he shouted, pointing at the three\nprisoners. 'This is no proof!'\n'His Majesty disagrees!' bellowed Hoff, 'and does not require your\npermission!' He held up a large document. 'The Guild of Mercers is hereby\ndissolved! Their licence revoked by Royal decree!

Until such\ntime as suitable candidates are found, the routes will be managed by\ncapable, loyal, hands.

Hoff held out a smaller paper. 'This is a warrant for the arrest\nof Magister Kault, bearing the King's own signature. We would ask that you\nserve it forthwith.' Glokta bowed stiffly and took the paper from the Lord\nChamberlain's outstretched hand. 'You,' said Hoff, turning his eye on\nJalenhorm.\n'Lieutenant Jalenhorm, my Lord!' shouted the big man, stepping smartly\nforward.\n'Whatever,' snapped Hoff impatiently, 'take twenty of the King's Own\nand escort Inquisitor Glokta to the Mercers' Guildhall.

Jalenhorm crossed the floor and ran up the aisle\ntoward the exit, holding the hilt of his sword in one hand to stop it knocking\nagainst his leg.

Excited babbling\nfilled the air once more, gradually rising in volume and soon joined by\nclattering and stamping as the representatives began to rise and leave the\nroom. Arch Lector Sult remained seated, watching his beaten adversaries\nfile reluctantly off the front row. Jezal met the desperate eyes of Salem\nRews one last time as he was led towards the small door, then Practical\nFrost jerked at the chain and he was lost in the darkness beyond.\nOutside, the square was even busier than before, the dense throng growing\never more excited as the news of the dissolution of the Guild of Mercers\nspread to those who had not been within. People stood, disbelieving, or\nhurried here and there: scared, surprised, confused. Jezal saw one man\nstaring at him, staring at anyone, face pale, hands trembling. A Mercer\nperhaps, or a man in too deep with the Mercers, deep enough to be ruined\nalong with them. There would be many such men.\nJezal felt a sudden tingling. Ardee West was leaning casually against the\nstones a little further on. They had not met in some time, not since that\ndrunken outburst of hers, and he was surprised how pleased he was to see\nher. Probably she had been punished long enough, he told himself.\nEveryone deserved the chance to apologise. He hastened towards her with a\nbroad smile on his lips. Then he noticed who she was with.\n'That little bastard!' he muttered under his breath.\nLieutenant Brint was chatting freely in his cheap uniform, leaning closer\nto Ardee than Jezal thought was appropriate, underlining his tedious points\nwith flamboyant gestures of his arms. She was nodding, smiling, then she\ntipped her head back and laughed, slapping the Lieutenant playfully on the\nchest. Brint laughed as well, the ugly little shit. They laughed together. For\nsome reason Jezal felt a sharp pang of fury.\n'Jezal, how are you!' shouted Brint, still giggling.\nHe stepped up close. 'That's Captain Luthar!' he spat, 'and how I am is\nnone of your concern! Don't you have a job to do?'\nBrint's mouth hung stupidly open for a moment, then his brows drew\ninto a surly frown. 'Yes, sir,' he muttered, turning and stalking off. Jezal\nwatched him go with a contempt even more intense than usual.\n'Well that was charming,' said Ardee. 'Are those the manners you should\nuse before a lady?'\n'I really couldn't say. Why? Was there one watching?'\nHe turned to look at her and caught, just for a moment, a self-satisfied\nsmirk. Quite a nasty expression, as though she had enjoyed his outburst. He\nwondered for a silly instant whether she might have arranged the meeting,\nhave placed herself and that idiot where Jezal would see them, hoping to\narouse his jealousy… then she smiled at him, and laughed, and Jezal felt his\nanger fading. She looked very fine, he thought, tanned and vibrant in the\nsunlight, laughing out loud, not caring who heard. Very fine. Better than\never, in fact. A chance meeting was all, what else could it be?

'Jumped-up, arrogant nobody, he's probably nothing\nmore than some rich man's bastard. No blood, no money, no manners—'\n'More than me, of all three.'\nJezal cursed his big mouth. Rather than dragging an apology from her\nhe was now in need of giving one himself. He sought desperately for some\nway out of this self-made trap. 'Oh, but he's an absolute moron!' he whined.\n'Well,' and Jezal was relieved to see one corner of Ardee's mouth curl up\nin a sly smile, 'he is at that. Shall we walk?' She slipped her hand through\nhis arm before he had the chance to answer, and started to lead him off\ntowards the Kingsway. Jezal allowed himself to be guided between the\nfrightened, the angry, the excited people.\n'So is it true?' she asked.\n'Is what true?'\n'That the Mercers are finished?'\n'So it seems. Your old friend Sand dan Glokta was in the thick of it. He\ngave quite the performance, for a cripple.'\nArdee looked down at the floor. 'You wouldn't want to get on the wrong\nside of him, crippled or no.'\n'No.' Jezal's mind went back to Salem Rews' terrified eyes, staring\ndesperately at him as he vanished into the darkness of the archway. 'No, you\nwouldn't.'\nA silence descended on them as they strolled down the avenue, but it\nwas a comfortable one. He liked walking with her. It no longer seemed\nimportant whether anyone apologised. Perhaps she had been right about the\nfencing anyway, just a little. Ardee seemed to read his thoughts. 'How's the\nswordplay going?' she asked.\n'Not bad. How's the drinking going?'\nShe raised a dark eyebrow. 'Excellent well. If only there was a Contest\nfor that every year, I'd soon come to the attention of the public' Jezal\nlaughed, looking down at her as she walked beside him, and she smiled\nback. So clever, so sharp, so fearless. So damn fine looking. Jezal wondered\nif there had ever been a woman quite like her. If only she had the right\nblood, he thought to himself, and some money.

'I think they heard you, Lieutenant,' said\nGlokta crisply, 'but are choosing not to answer. Would you be so kind as to\nbreak the door down?'\n'What?'

There was a deafening crack and a tearing\nof wood as he crashed into one of the doors with his burly shoulder, tearing\nit off its hinges and sending it crashing onto the floor of the room beyond.\n'Like so,' muttered Glokta as he stepped through the archway, the\nsplinters still settling. Jalenhorm followed him, looking dazed, a dozen\narmoured soldiers clattering behind.\nAn outraged clerk blocked the-corridor beyond. 'You can't just—oof!' he\ncried, as Frost flung him out of the way and his face crunched into the wall.\n'Arrest that man!' shouted Glokta, waving his cane at the dumbstruck\nclerk. One of the soldiers grabbed him roughly with gauntleted fists and\nshoved him tumbling out into the daylight. Practicals began to pour through\nthe broken doors, heavy sticks in their hands, eyes fierce above their masks.\n'Arrest everyone!' shouted Glokta over his shoulder, limping down the\ncorridor as fast as he could, following Frost's broad back into the bowels of\nthe building.\nThrough an open door Glokta saw a merchant in colourful robes, face\ncovered with a sheen of sweat as he desperately heaped documents onto a\nblazing fire. 'Seize him!' screamed Glokta. A pair of Practicals leaped past\ninto the room and began clubbing the man with their sticks. He fell with a\ncry, upsetting a table and kicking over a pile of ledgers. Loose papers and\nbits of burning ash fluttered through the air as the sticks rose and fell.\nGlokta hurried on, crashes and cries spreading out into the building\naround him. The place was full of the smell of smoke, and sweat, and fear.\nThe doors are all guarded, but Kault might have a secret means of escape.\nHe's a slippery one. We must hope we are not too late. Curse this leg of\nmine! Not too late…\nGlokta gasped and winced in pain, tottering as someone clutched at his\ncoat. 'Help me!' shrieked the man, 'I am innocent!' Blood on a plump face.\nFingers clutched at Glokta's clothes, threatening to drag him to the floor.\n'Get him off me!' shouted Glokta, beating at him weakly with his cane,\nclawing at the wall in his efforts to stay upright.

They reached a broad\nstaircase, and Glokta eyed it with hatred. My old enemies, always here\nahead of me. He laboured up as best he could, waving Practical Frost\nforward with his free hand. A baffled merchant was dragged past them and\naway, squawking something about his rights, heels kicking against the\nstairs.\nGlokta slipped and nearly fell on his face, but someone caught him by\nthe elbow and kept him upright. It was Jalenhorm, a look of confusion still\nsplattered across his heavy, honest face. So big men have their uses after\nall. The young officer helped him up the rest of the steps. Glokta did not\nhave the energy to refuse him. Why bother? A man should know his\nlimitations. There's nothing noble in falling on your face. I should know\nthat.\nThere was a large ante-chamber at the top of the stairs, richly decorated\nwith a thick carpet and colourful hangings on the walls. Two guards stood\nbefore a large door with their swords drawn, dressed in the livery of the\nGuild of Mercers. Frost was facing them, hands rolled into white fists.\nJalenhorm pulled out his own sword as he reached the landing, stepping\nforward to stand next to the albino. Glokta had to smile. The tongueless\ntorturer and the flower of chivalry. An unlikely alliance.\n'I have a warrant for Kault, signed by the King himself.' Glokta held out\nthe paper so the guards could see it. 'The Mercers are finished. You have\nnothing to gain by getting in our way. Put up your swords! You have my\nword, you will not be harmed!'\nThe two guards glanced at each other uncertainly. 'Put them up!' shouted\nJalenhorm, edging a little closer.\n'Alright!' One of the men bent down and slid his sword along the\nboards. Frost caught it under one foot.\n'And you!' shouted Glokta to the other one. 'Now!' The guard obeyed,\nthrowing his sword to the floor and putting up his hands. A moment later\nFrost's fist crunched into the point of his jaw, knocking him cold and\nsending him crashing into the wall.\n'But—' shouted the first guard. Frost grabbed him by the shirt and flung\nhim down the stairs. He turned over and over, banging on the steps,\nflopping to the bottom, lying still. I know what that feels like.\nJalenhorm was standing motionless and blinking, his sword still raised.\n'I thought you said—'\n'Never mind about that. Frost, look for another way in.'\n'Thhh.'

All was over-sized, over-embellished, over-expensive. But\nwho needs taste when you have money?

So he does\nhave a means of escape, after all.\n'Inquisitor Glokta!' Kault gave a squeaky, nervous laugh. 'What a\npleasure to finally meet you! I've been hearing all about your\ninvestigations!' His fingers twitched at the knot on the rope, making sure it\nwas tied securely.\n'Is your collar too tight, Magister? Perhaps you should remove it?'\nAnother squeak of merriment.

A big white hand appeared, fingers\ncurling slowly round the door frame. Frost. There is still hope of catching\nhim, then. I must keep him talking.\n'There are no questions left to answer. We know it all.'\n'Do you indeed?' giggled the Magister. The albino edged silently into\nthe room, keeping to the shadows near the wall, hidden from Kault by the\nbulk of the cabinet.\n'We know about Kalyne. About your little arrangement.'\n'Imbecile! We had no arrangement! He was far too honourable to be\nbought! He would never take a mark from me!' Then how… Kault smiled a\nsick little smile. 'Sult's secretary,' he said, giggling again.

Kault\nseemed frozen in space for a moment as all that expensive glass shattered\naround him, shards and splinters glittering through the air, then he was\ngone. The rope snapped taut.\n'Thhhhh!' hissed Frost, glaring at the broken window.\n'He jumped!' gasped Jalenhorm, his mouth hanging open.\n'Clearly.' Glokta limped over to the desk and took the ripped strip of\ncloth from Frost's hands. Close up it scarcely seemed magnificent at all:\nbrightly coloured but badly woven.\n'Who would have thought?' muttered Glokta to himself. 'Poor quality.'\nHe limped to the window and peered through the shattered hole. The head\nof the honourable Guild of Mercers was swinging slowly back and forth,\ntwenty feet below, his torn, gold-embroidered gown flapping around him in\nthe breeze. Cheap clothes and expensive windows. If the cloth had been\nstronger we would have got him. If the window had more lead, we would\nhave got him. Lives hinge on such chances. Beneath him in the street a\nhorrified crowd was already gathering: pointing, babbling, staring up at the\nhanging body. A woman screamed. Fear, or excitement? They sound the\nsame.\n'Lieutenant, would you be so good as to go down and disperse that\ncrowd? Then we can cut our friend loose and take him back with us.'"

He was\navoiding West's eye for some reason. 'And you? What have you got in mind\nfor today?'\nJezal fiddled with his steels. 'Er, nothing planned… not really.' He\nglanced up furtively. For such a good card player, the man was a useless\nliar.\nWest felt a niggling of worry. 'Ardee wouldn't be involved in your lack\nof plans would she?'\n'Erm…'\nThe niggling became a cold throbbing. 'Well?'\n'Maybe,' snapped Jezal, 'well… yes.'\nWest stepped right up to the younger man. 'Jezal,' he heard himself\nsaying, slowly through gritted teeth, 'I hope you're not planning to fuck my\nsister.'\n'Now look here—'\nThe throbbing boiled over. West's hands gripped hold of Jezal by his\nshoulders. 'No, you look!' he snarled. 'I'll not have her trifled with, you\nunderstand? She's been hurt before, and I'll not see her hurt any more! Not\nby you, not by anyone! I won't stand for it! She's not one of your games,\nyou hear me?'\n'Alright,' said Jezal, face suddenly pale. 'Alright! I've no designs on her!\nWe're just friends is all. I like her! She doesn't know anyone here and… you\ncan trust me… there's no harm in it! Ah! Get off me!'\nWest realised he was squeezing Jezal's arms with all his strength. How\nhad that happened? He'd only meant to have a quiet word, and now he'd\ngone way too far. Hurt before… damn it! He should never have said that!\nHe let go suddenly, drew back, swallowing his fury. 'I don't want you seeing\nher any more, do you hear me?'\n'Now hold on West, who are you to—'\nWest's anger began to pulse again. 'Jezal,' he growled, 'I'm your friend,\nso I'm asking you.' He stepped forward again, closer than ever. 'And I'm her\nbrother, so I'm warning you. Stay away! No good can come of it!'\nJezal shrank back against the wall. 'Alright… alright! She's your sister!'\nWest turned and stalked towards the archway, rubbing the back of his\nneck, his head thumping.\nLord Marshal Burr was sitting and staring out of the window when West\narrived at his offices. A big, grim, beefy man with a thick brown beard and a\nsimple uniform. West wondered how bad the news would be. If the\nMarshal's face was anything to go by it was very bad indeed.\n'Major West,' he said, glaring up from under his heavy brows. 'Thank\nyou for coming.'\n'Of course, sir.' West noticed three roughly-made wooden boxes on a\ntable by the wall. Burr saw him looking at them.\n'Gifts,' he said sourly, 'from our friend in the north, Bethod.'\n'Gifts?'"

The Marshal scowled and sucked at his teeth.\n'Why don't you have a look at what he sent us, Major?'\nWest walked over to the table, reached out and cautiously opened the lid\nof one of the boxes. An unpleasant smell flowed out, like well-rotted meat,\nbut there was nothing inside but some brown dirt. He opened the next box.\nThe smell was worse. More brown dirt, caked around the inside, and some\nhair, some strands of yellow hair. West swallowed, looked up at the\nfrowning Lord Marshal. 'Is this all, sir?'\nBurr snorted. 'If only. The rest we had to bury.'\n'Bury?'\nThe Marshal picked up a sheet of paper from his desk. 'Captain Silber,\nCaptain Hoss, Colonel Arinhorm. Those names mean anything to you?'\nWest felt sick. That smell. It reminded him of Gurkhul somehow, of the\nbattlefield. 'Colonel Arinhorm, I know,' he mumbled, staring at the three\nboxes, 'by reputation. He's commander of the garrison at Dunbrec'\n'Was,' corrected Burr, 'and the other two commanded small outposts\nnearby, on the frontier.'\n'The frontier?' mumbled West, but he already guessed what was coming.\n'Their heads, Major. The Northmen sent us their heads.' West\nswallowed, looking at the yellow hairs stuck to the inside of the box. 'Three\nsigns, they said, when it was time.' Burr got up from his chair and stood,\nlooking out of the window. 'The outposts were nothing: wooden buildings\nmostly, a palisade wall, ditches and so on, lightly manned. Little strategic\nimportance. Dunbrec is another matter.'\n'It commands the fords on the Whiteflow,' said West numbly, 'the best\nway out of Angland.'\n'Or in. A vital point. Considerable time and resources were spent on the\ndefences there. The very latest designs were used, our finest architects. A\ngarrison of three hundred men, with stores of weapons and food to stand a\nyear of siege. It was considered impregnable, the lynchpin of our plans for\nthe defence of the frontier.' Burr frowned, deep grooves appearing across\nthe bridge of his nose. 'Gone.'\nWest's head had started hurting again. 'When, sir?'\n'When is the question. It must have been at least two weeks ago, for\nthese 'gifts' to have reached us. I am being called defeatist,' said Burr sourly,\n'but I guess that the Northmen are loose and that, by now, they have overrun\nhalf of northern Angland. A mining community or two, several penal\ncolonies, nothing so far of major importance, no towns to speak of, but they\nare coming, West, and fast, you may be sure of that. You don't send heads to\nyour enemy, then wait politely for a reply.'\n'What is being done?'\n'Precious little! Angland is in uproar, of course.

The ports are choked with\ncivilians desperate to escape, rumours are rife of spies and murderers loose\nin the country, and mobs seek out citizens with Northern blood and beat\nthem, rob them, or worse. Put simply, it is chaos. Meanwhile we sit here on\nour fat arses, waiting.'\n'But… weren't we warned? Didn't we know?'\n'Of course!' Burr threw his broad hand up in the air, 'but no one took it\nvery seriously, would you believe! Damn painted savage stabs himself on\nthe floor of the Open Council, challengess us before the King, and nothing\nis done! Government by committee! Everyone pulling their own way! You\ncan only react, never prepare!' The Marshal coughed and burped, spat on\nthe floor. 'Gah! Damn it! Damn indigestion!' He sat back in his chair,\nrubbing his stomach unhappily.\nWest hardly knew what to say. 'How do we proceed?' he mumbled.\n'We've been ordered north immediately, meaning as soon as anyone can\nbe bothered to supply me with men and arms. The King, meaning that\ndrunkard Hoff, has commanded me to bring these Northmen to heel. Twelve\nregiments of the King's Own—seven of foot and five of horse, to be fleshed\nout with levies from the aristocracy, and whatever the Anglanders haven't\nsquandered before we get there.'\nWest shifted uncomfortably in his chair. 'That should be an\noverwhelming force.'\n'Huh,' grunted the Marshal. 'It better be. It's everything we have, more\nor less, and that worries me.' West frowned. 'Dagoska, Major. We cannot\nfight the Gurkish and the Northmen both at once.'\n'But surely, sir, the Gurkish, they wouldn't risk another war so soon? I\nthought it was all idle talk?'\n'I hope so, I hope so.' Burr pushed some papers absently around his\ndesk. 'But this new Emperor, Uthman, is not what we were expecting. He\nwas the youngest son, but when he heard of his father's death… he had all\nhis brothers strangled. Strangled them himself, some say. Uthman-ul-Dosht,\nthey are calling him. Uthman the Merciless. He has already declared his\nintention to recapture Dagoska. Empty talk, perhaps. Perhaps not.' Burr\npursed his lips. 'They say he has spies everywhere. He might even now be\nlearning of our troubles in Angland, might even now be preparing to take\nadvantage of our weakness. We must be done quickly with these Northmen.\nVery quickly. Twelve regiments and levies from the noblemen. And from\nthat point of view it could not be a worse time.'\n'Sir?'\n'This business with the Mercers. A bad business.

A useless crowd of extra mouths to feed, and\nclothe, and arm, and we are desperately short of good officers.'\n'I have some good men in my battalion.'\nBurr twitched impatiently. 'Good men, yes! Honest men, enthusiastic\nmen, but not experienced! Most of those who fought in the South did not\nenjoy it. They have left the army, and have no intention of returning. Have\nyou seen how young the officers are these days? We're a damn finishing\nschool! And now His Highness the Prince has expressed his interest in a\ncommand.

It's\nLadisla I'm talking of! Commanding a division! A man who spends a\nthousand marks a month on clothes! His lack of discipline is notorious! I've\nheard it said that he's forced himself on more than one servant in the palace,\nbut that the Arch Lector was able to silence the girls.'\n'Surely not,' said West, although he had actually heard such a rumour\nhimself.\n'The heir to the throne, in harm's way, when the King is in poor health?\nA ludicrous notion!' Burr got up, burping and wincing. 'Damn this stomach!'\nHe stalked over to the window and frowned out across the Agriont.\n'They think it will be easily settled,' he said quietly. 'The Closed\nCouncil. A little jaunt in Angland, done with before the first snow falls. In\nspite of this shock with Dunbrec. They never learn. They said the same\nabout our war with the Gurkish, and that nearly finished us. These\nNorthmen are not the primitives they think. I fought with Northern\nmercenaries in Starikland: hard men used to hard lives, raised on warfare,\nfearless and stubborn, expert at fighting in the hills, in the forests, in the\ncold. They do not follow our rules, or even understand them. They will\nbring a violence and a savagery to the battlefield that would make the\nGurkish blush.' Burr turned away from the window, back to West. 'You were\nborn in Angland, weren't you, Major?'\n'Yes, sir, in the south, near Ostenhorm. My family's farm was there,\nbefore my father died…' He trailed off.\n'You were raised there?'\n'Yes.'\n'You know the land then?'\nWest frowned. 'In that region, sir, but I have not been back for—'\n'Do you know these Northmen?'\n'Some. There are still many living in Angland.'\n'You speak their tongue?'\n'Yes, a little, but they speak many—'\n'Good.

And the Lord\nMarshal turned back to his papers.\n'Yes, sir,' muttered West.\nHe fumbled the door shut behind him with numb fingers, walked slowly\ndown the hallway, staring at the floor. War. War in the North. Dunbrec\nfallen, the Northmen loose in Angland. Officers hurried around him.\nSomeone brushed past, but he hardly noticed. There were people in danger,\nmortal danger! People he knew maybe, neighbours from home. There was\nfighting even now, inside the Union's borders! He rubbed his jaw. This war\ncould be a terrible thing. Worse than Gurkhul had been, even, and he would\nbe at the heart of it. A place on a Lord Marshal's staff. Him? Collem West?\nA commoner? He still could hardly believe it.\nWest felt a sneaking, guilty glow of satisfaction. It was for just such an\nappointment that he had been working like a dog all these years. If he did\nwell there was no telling where he might go. This war was a bad thing, a\nterrible thing, no doubt. He felt himself grinning. A terrible thing. But it just\nmight be the making of him.\nThe Theatrical Outfitter's\n« ^ »\nThe deck creaked and shifted beneath his feet, the sail-cloth flapped gently,\nsea birds crowed and called in the salty air above.\n'I never thought to see such a thing,' muttered Logen.\nThe city was a huge white crescent, stretching all round the wide blue\nbay, sprawling across many bridges, tiny in the distance, and onto rocky\nislands in the sea. Here and there green parks stood out from the confusion\nof buildings, the thin grey lines of rivers and canals shone in the sun. There\nwere walls too, studded with towers, skirting the distant edge of the city and\nstriking boldly through the jumble of houses. Logen's jaw hung stupidly\nopen, his eyes darted here and there, unable to take in the whole.\n'Adua,' murmured Bayaz. 'The centre of the world. The poets call her\nthe city of white towers. Beautiful, isn't she, from a distance?' The Magus\nleaned towards him. 'Believe me, though, she stinks when you get close.'\nA vast fortress rose up from within the city, its sheer white walls\ntowering above the carpet of buildings outside, bright sunlight glinting on\nshining domes within. Logen had never dreamed of a man-made thing so\ngreat, so proud, so strong. One tower in particular rose high, high over all\nthe others, a tapering cluster of smooth, dark pillars, seeming to support the\nvery sky.\n'And Bethod means to make war on this?' he whispered. 'He must be\nmad.'\n'Perhaps. Bethod, for all his waste and pride, understands the Union.'\nBayaz nodded towards the city. 'They are jealous of one another, all those\npeople. It may be a union in name, but they fight each other tooth and nail.\nThe lowly squabble over trifles. The great wage secret wars for power and\nwealth, and they call it government. Wars of words, and tricks, and guile,\nbut no less bloody for that. The casualties are many.' The Magus sighed."

Old squabbles are never settled, but thrive, and put down roots, and\nthe roots grow deeper with the passing years. It has always been so. They\nare not like you, Logen. A man here can smile, and fawn, and call you\nfriend, give you gifts with one hand and stab you with the other. You will\nfind this a strange place.'\nLogen already found it the strangest thing he had ever seen. There was\nno end to it. As their boat slipped into the bay the city seemed to grow more\nvast than ever. A forest of white buildings, speckled with dark windows,\nembracing them on all sides, covering the hills in roofs and towers,\ncrowding together, wall squashed to wall, pressing up against the water on\nthe shoreline.\nShips and boats of all designs vied with each other in the bay, sails\nbillowing, crewmen crying out over the noise of the spray, hurrying about\nthe decks and crawling through the rigging. Some were smaller even than\ntheir own little two-sailed boat. Some were far larger. Logen gawped,\namazed, as a huge vessel ploughed through the water towards them, shining\nspray flying from its prow. A mountain of wood, floating by some magic in\nthe sea. The ship passed, leaving them rocking in its wake, but there were\nmore, many more, tethered to the countless wharves along the shore.\nLogen, shielding his eyes against the bright sun with one hand, began to\nmake out people on the sprawling docks. He began to hear them too, a faint\ndin of voices crying and carts rattling and cargoes clattering to the ground.\nThere were hundreds of tiny figures, swarming among the ships and\nbuildings like black ants. 'How many live here?' he whispered.\n'Thousands.' Bayaz shrugged. 'Hundreds of thousands. People from\nevery land within the Circle of the World. There are Northmen here, and\ndark-skinned Kantics from Gurkhul and beyond. People from the Old\nEmpire, far to the west, and merchants of the Free Cities of Styria. Others\ntoo, from still further away—the Thousand Islands, distant Suljuk, and\nThond, where they worship the sun. More people than can be counted—\nliving, dying, working, breeding, climbing one upon the other. Welcome,'\nand Bayaz spread his arms wide to encompass the monstrous, the beautiful,\nthe endless city, 'to civilisation!'\nHundreds of thousands. Logen struggled to understand it. Hundreds…\nof thousands. Could there be so many people in the world? He stared at the\ncity, all around him, wondering, rubbing his aching eyes. What might a\nhundred thousand people look like?\nAn hour later he knew.\nOnly in battle had Logen ever been so squashed, hemmed, pressed by\nother people. It was like a battle, here on the docks—the cries, the anger,\nthe crush, the fear and confusion. A battle in which no mercy was shown,\nand which had no end and no winners.

On the road, when Bayaz and Quai had\nridden close beside him, he'd felt squeezed. Now there were people on\nevery side, pushing, jostling, shouting. Hundreds of them! Thousands!\nHundreds of thousands! Could they really all be people? People like him\nwith thoughts and moods and dreams? Faces loomed up and flashed by—\nsurly, anxious, frowning, gone in a sickening whirl of colour. Logen\nswallowed, blinked. His throat was painfully dry. His head span. Surely this\nwas hell. He knew he deserved to be here, but he didn't remember dying.\n'Malacus!' he hissed desperately. The apprentice looked round. 'Stop a\nmoment!' Logen pulled at his collar, trying to let some air in. 'I can't\nbreathe!'\nQuai grinned. 'It might just be the smell.'\nIt might at that. The docks smelled like hell, and no mistake. The reek\nof stinking fish, sickly spices, rotting fruit, fresh dung, sweating horses and\nmules and people, mingled and bred under the hot sun and became worse\nby far than any one alone.\n'Move!' A shoulder knocked Logen roughly aside and was gone. He\nleaned against a grimy wall and wiped sweat from his face.\nBayaz was smiling. 'Not like the wide and barren North, eh,\nNinefingers?'\n'No.' Logen watched the people milling past—the horses, the carts, the\nendless faces. A man stared suspiciously at him as he passed. A boy pointed\nat him and shouted something. A woman with a basket gave him a wide\nberth, staring fearfully up as she hurried by. Now he had a moment to think,\nthey were all looking, and pointing, and staring, and they didn't look happy.\nLogen leaned down to Malacus. 'I am feared and hated throughout the\nNorth. I don't like it, but I know why.' A sullen group of sailors stared at\nhim with hard eyes, muttering to each other under their breath. He watched\nthem, puzzled, until they disappeared behind a rumbling wagon. 'Why do\nthey hate me here?'\n'Bethod has moved quickly,' muttered Bayaz, frowning out at the\ncrowds. 'His war with the Union has already begun. We will not find the\nNorth too popular in Adua, I fear.'\n'How do they know where I'm from?' Malacus raised an eyebrow. 'You\nstick out somewhat.' Logen flinched as a pair of laughing youths flashed by\nhim. 'I do? Among all this?'\n'Only like a huge, scarred, dirty gatepost.'\n'Ah.' He looked down at himself. 'I see.'\nAway from the docks the crowds grew sparser, the air cleaner, the noise\nfaded. It was still teeming, stinking, and noisy, but at least Logen could take\na breath.\nThey passed across wide paved squares, decorated with plants and\nstatues, where brightly-painted wooden signs hung over doors—blue fish,\npink pigs, purple bunches of grapes, brown loaves of bread.

There were\ntables and chairs out in the sun where people sat and ate from flat pots,\ndrank from green glass cups. They threaded through narrow alleys, where\nrickety-looking wood and plaster buildings leaned out over them, almost\nmeeting above their heads, leaving only a thin strip of blue sky between.\nThey wandered down wide, cobbled roads, busy with people and lined with\nmonstrous white buildings. Logen blinked and gaped at all of it.\nOn no moor, however foggy, in no forest, however dense, had Logen\never felt so completely lost. He had no idea now in what direction the boat\nwas, though they'd left it no more than half an hour ago. The sun was\nhidden behind the towering buildings and everything looked the same. He\nwas terrified he'd lose track of Bayaz and Quai in the crowds, and be lost\nforever. He hurried after the back of the wizard's bald head, following him\ninto an open space. A great road, bigger than any they'd seen so far,\nbounded on either side by white palaces behind high walls and fences, lined\nwith ancient trees.\nThe people here were different. Their clothes were bright and gaudy, cut\nin strange styles that served no purpose. The women hardly seemed like\npeople at all—pale and bony, swaddled in shining fabric, flapping at\nthemselves in the hot sun with pieces of cloth stretched over sticks.\n'Where are we?' he shouted at Bayaz. If the wizard had answered that\nthey were on the moon, Logen would not have been surprised.\n'This is the Middleway, one of the city's main thoroughfares! It cuts\nthrough the very centre of the city to the Agriont!'\n'Agriont?'\n'Fortress, palace, barracks, seat of government. A city within the city.\nThe heart of the Union. That's where we're going.'\n'We are?' A group of sour young men stared suspiciously at Logen as he\npassed them. 'Will they let us in?'\n'Oh yes. But they won't like it.'\nLogen struggled on through the crowds. Everywhere the sun twinkled\non the panes of glass windows, hundreds of them. Carleon had a few glass\nwindows in the grandest buildings, at least before they'd sacked the city.\nPrecious few afterwards, it had to be admitted. Precious little of anything.\nThe Dogman had loved the sound the glass made as it broke. He'd prodded\nat the windows with a spear, a great big smile on his face, delighted by the\ncrash and tinkle.\nThat had hardly been the worst of it. Bethod had given the city to his\nCarls for three days. That was his custom, and they loved him for it. Logen\nhad lost his finger in the battle the day before, and they'd closed the wound\nwith hot iron. It throbbed, and throbbed, and the pain had made him savage.\nAs though he'd needed an excuse for violence back then. He remembered\nthe stink of blood, and sweat, and smoke. The sounds of screaming, and\ncrashing, and laughter."

The crowds parted and a long column of\nmen tramped by, shepherded by armoured guards. Some were young, mere\nboys, some were very old. All were dirty and ragged, and few of them\nlooked healthy. A couple were clearly lame, hobbling along as best they\ncould. One near the front had only one arm. A passer-by in a fabulous\ncrimson jacket held a square of cloth over his wrinkled nose as the beggars\nshuffled past.\n'What are these?' Logen whispered to Bayaz. 'Law-breakers?'\nThe Magus chuckled. 'Soldiers.'\nLogen stared at them—filthy, coughing, limping, some without boots.\n'Soldiers? These?'\n'Oh yes. They go to fight Bethod.'\nLogen rubbed at his temples. 'A clan once sent their poorest warrior, a\nman called Forley the 'Weakest, to fight me in a duel. They meant it by way\nof surrender. Why does this Union send their weakest?' Logen shook his\nhead grimly. 'They won't beat Bethod with such as these.'\n'They will send others.' Bayaz pointed out another, smaller gathering.\n'Those are soldiers too.'\n'Those?' A group of tall youths, dressed in gaudy suits of red or bright\ngreen cloth, a couple with outsize hats. They were at least wearing swords,\nof a kind, but they hardly looked like fighting men. Fighting women,\nmaybe. Logen frowned, staring from one group to the other. The dirty\nbeggars, the gaudy lads. It was hard for him to say which were the stranger.\nA tiny bell jingled as the door opened, and Logen followed Bayaz through"

It was hard for him to say which were the stranger.\nA tiny bell jingled as the door opened, and Logen followed Bayaz through\nthe low archway, Malacus behind him. The shop was dim after the bright\nstreet and it took Logen's eyes a moment to adjust. Leaning against a wall\nwere sheets of wood, childishly daubed with pictures of buildings, forests,\nmountains. Strange clothes were draped over stands beside them—flowing\nrobes, lurid gowns, suits of armour, enormous hats and helmets, rings and\njewellery, even a heavy crown. Weapons occupied a small rack, swords and\nspears richly decorated. Logen stepped closer, frowning. They were fakes.\nNothing was real. The weapons were painted wood, the crown was made of\nflaking tin, the jewels were coloured glass.\n'What is this place?'\nBayaz was casting an eye over the robes by the wall. 'A theatrical\noutfitters.'\n'A what?'\n'The people of this city love spectacle. Comedy, drama, theatre of all\nkinds. This shop provides equipment for the mounting of plays.'\n'Stories?' Logen poked at a wooden sword. 'Some people have too much\ntime on their hands.'\nA small, plump man emerged from a door at the back of the shop,\nlooking Bayaz, Malacus and Logen over suspiciously. 'Can I help you,\ngentlemen?'\n'Of course.' Bayaz stepped forward, switching effortlessly to the\ncommon tongue. 'We are mounting a production, and require some\ncostumes. We understand you are the foremost theatrical outfitter's in all of\nAdua.'\nThe shopkeeper smiled nervously, taking in their grimy faces and travel\nstained clothes. 'True, true, but… er… quality is expensive, gentlemen.'\n'Money is no object.' Bayaz took out a bulging purse and tossed it\nabsently on the counter. It sagged open, heavy golden coins scattering\nacross the wood.\nThe shopkeeper's eyes lit with an inner fire. 'Of course! What precisely\ndid you have in mind?'\n'I need a magnificent robe, suitable for a Magus, or a great sorcerer, or\nsome such. Something of the arcane about it, certainly. Then we'll have\nsomething similar, if less impressive, for an apprentice. Finally we need\nsomething for a mighty warrior, a prince of the distant North. Something\nwith fur, I imagine.'\n'Those should be straightforward. I will see what we have.' The\nshopkeeper disappeared through the door behind the counter.\n'What is all this shit?' asked Logen.\nThe wizard grinned. 'People are born to their station here. They have\ncommoners, to fight, and farm the land, and do the work. They have gentry,\nto trade, and build and do the thinking. They have nobility, to own the land\nand push the others around. They have royalty…' Bayaz glanced at the tin\ncrown '… I forget exactly why. In the North you can rise as high as your\nmerits will take you. Only look at our mutual friend, Bethod. Not so here.

'One mystical robe, suitable for the most\npowerful of wizards! Used last year for a Juvens in a production of The End\nof the Empire, during the spring festival. It is, if I may say so, some of my\nbest work.' Bayaz held the shimmering swathe of crimson cloth up to the\nfaint light, gazing at it admiringly. Arcane diagrams, mystical lettering, and\nsymbols of sun, moon and stars, glittered in silver thread.\nMalacus ran a hand over the shining cloth of his own absurd garment. 'I\ndon't think you'd have laughed me off so quickly, eh, Logen, if I'd arrived at\nyour campfire dressed in this?'\nLogen winced. 'I reckon I might've.'\nAnd here we have a splendid piece of barbarian garb.' The shopkeeper\nhefted a black leather tunic onto the counter, set with swirls of shiny brass,\ntrimmed with pointless tissues of delicate chain-mail. He pointed at the\nmatching fur cloak. 'This is real sable!' It was a ludicrous piece of clothing,\nequally useless for warmth or protection.\nLogen folded his arms across his old coat. 'You think I'm going to wear\nthat?'\nThe shopkeeper swallowed nervously. 'You must forgive my friend,'\nsaid Bayaz. 'He is an actor after the new fashion. He believes in losing\nhimself entirely in his role.'\n'Is that so?' squeaked the man, looking Logen up and down. 'Northmen\nare… I suppose… topical.'\n'Absolutely. I do declare, Master Ninefingers is the very best at what he\ndoes.' The old wizard nudged Logen in the ribs. 'The very best. I have seen\nit.'\n'If you say so.' The shopkeeper looked far from convinced. 'Might I\nenquire what you will be staging?'\n'Oh, it's a new piece.' Bayaz tapped the side of his bald head with a\nfinger. 'I am still working on the details.'\n'Really?'\n'Indeed. More a scene than an entire play.' He glanced back at the robe,\nadmiring the way the light glittered on the arcane symbols. 'A scene in\nwhich Bayaz, the First of the Magi, finally takes up his seat on the Closed\nCouncil.'\n'Ah,' the shopkeeper nodded knowingly. 'A political piece. A biting\nsatire, perhaps? Will it be comic, or dramatic in tone?'\nBayaz glanced sidelong at Logen.

Since he had\ncut down on the drinking the improvement in his stamina had been\nimpressive. He was scarcely even out of breath. It was early and the streets\nof the city were nearly empty. The odd person would look up at him as he\nran by, maybe even call out some word of encouragement, but Jezal barely\nnoticed them. His eyes were fixed on the sparkling, lapping water in the\nmoat, and his mind was elsewhere.\nArdee. Where else was it ever? He had supposed, after that day when\nWest had warned him off, after he had stopped seeing her, that his thoughts\nwould soon return to other matters, and other women. He had applied\nhimself to his fencing with a will, attempted to show an interest in his duties\nas an officer, but he found himself unable to concentrate, and other women\nseemed now pale, flat, tedious creatures. The long runs, the monotonous\nexercises with bar and beam, gave his mind ample opportunity to wander.\nThe tedium of peacetime soldiering was even worse: reading boring papers,\nstanding guard on things that needed no guarding. His attention would\ninevitably slip, and then she would be there.\nArdee in wholesome peasant garb, flushed and sweaty from hard work\nin the fields. Ardee in the finery of a princess, glittering with jewels. Ardee\nbathing in forest pools, while he watched from the bushes. Ardee proper\nand demure, glancing shyly up at him from beneath her lashes. Ardee a\nwhore by the docks, beckoning to him from a grimy doorway. The fantasies\nwere infinite in variety, but they all ended the same way.\nHis hour-long circuit of the Agriont was complete and he thumped\nacross the bridge and back in through the south gate.\nJezal treated the guards to their daily share of indifference, trotted\nthrough the tunnel and up the long ramp into the fortress, then turned\ntowards the courtyard where Marshal Varuz would be waiting. All the\nwhile, Ardee was rubbing up against the back of his mind.\nIt was hardly as though he had nothing else to think about. The Contest\nwas close now, very close. Soon he would fight before the cheering crowds,\nhis family and friends among them. It might make his reputation… or sink\nit. He should have been lying awake at night, tense and sweating, worrying\nendlessly about forms, and training, and steels. And yet somehow that\nwasn't what he thought about in bed.\nThen there was a war on. It was easy to forget, here in the sunny lanes\nof the Agriont, that Angland had been invaded by hordes of slavering\nbarbarians. He would be going north soon, to lead his company in battle.\nThere, surely, was a thought to keep a man occupied. Was not war a deadly\nbusiness? He could be hurt, or scarred, or killed even. Jezal tried to conjure\nup the twisting, twitching, painted face of Fenris the Feared. Legions of\nscreaming savages descending upon the Agriont. It was a terrible business\nalright, a dangerous and frightening business.\nHmmm."

What if, say, she were to fall into the hands\nof the Northmen? Jezal would rush to her rescue, of course. She would not\nbe hurt. Well, not badly. Perhaps her clothes a little torn, like so? No doubt\nshe would be frightened, grateful. He would be obliged to comfort her, of\ncourse. She might even faint? He might have to carry her, her head pressed\nagainst his shoulder. He might have to lay her down and loosen her clothes.\nTheir lips might touch, just brush gently, hers might part a little, then…\nJezal stumbled in the road. There was a pleasant swelling building in his\ncrotch. Pleasant, but hardly compatible with a brisk run. He was nearly at\nthe courtyard now, and this would never do at fencing practice. He glanced\ndesperately around for a distraction, and nearly choked on his tongue.\nMajor West was standing by the wall, dressed to fence and watching him\napproach with an unusually grim expression. For an instant, Jezal wondered\nif his friend might be able to tell what he had been thinking. He swallowed\nguiltily, felt the blood rushing to his face. West couldn't know, he couldn't.\nBut he was most unhappy about something.\n'Luthar,' he grunted.\n'West.' Jezal stared down at his shoes. They had not been getting on too\nwell since West joined Lord Marshal Burr's staff. Jezal tried to be happy for\nhim, but could not escape the feeling that he was better qualified for the\npost. He had excellent blood after all, whether he had experience in the field\nor not. Then Ardee was still lurking between them, that unpleasant and\nneedless warning. Everyone knew that West had been first through the\nbreach at Ulrioch. Everyone knew that he had the devil of a temper. That\nhad always seemed exciting to Jezal, until he got on the wrong end of it.\n'Varuz is waiting.' West unfolded his arms and strode off towards the\narchway, 'and he's not alone.'\n'Not alone?'\n'The Marshal feels you need to get used to an audience.'\nJezal frowned. 'I'm surprised anyone cares in the present climate, what\nwith the war and all.'\n'You'd be surprised. Fighting and fencing and all things martial are very\nmuch the flavour. Everyone's wearing a sword these days, even if they've\nnever drawn one in their lives. There's an absolute fever about the Contest,\nbelieve me.'\nJezal blinked as they passed into the bright courtyard. A stand of\ntemporary seating had been hastily erected along one wall, packed from one\nend to the other with people, three score or more.\n'And here he is!' shouted Marshal Varuz. There was a ripple of polite\napplause. Jezal felt himself grinning—there were some very important\npeople in amongst the crowd. He spotted Marovia, the Lord High Justice,\nstroking his long beard. Lord Isher was not far away from him, looking\nslightly bored. Crown Prince Ladisla himself was lounging on the front row,\nshining in a shirt of gossamer chain-mail and clapping enthusiastically.

The\npeople on the benches behind had to lean over to see round the waving\nplume on his magnificent hat.\nVaruz handed Jezal his steels, still beaming. 'Don't you dare make me\nlook a fool!' he hissed. Jezal coughed nervously, looking up at the rows of\nexpectant people. His heart sank. Inquisitor Glokta's toothless grin leered at\nhim from the crowd, and on the row behind him… Ardee West. She was\nwearing an expression that she never had in his daydreams: one third sullen,\none third accusing, one third simply bored. He glanced away, staring toward\nthe opposite wall, inwardly cursing his own cowardice. He seemed unable\nto meet anyone's eye these days.\n'This bout will be fought with half-edged steels!' thundered the Lord\nMarshal. 'The best of three touches!' West already had his swords drawn\nand was making his way to the circle, marked out with white chalk in the\ncarefully shaved grass. Jezal's heart was hammering loud as he fumbled his\nown steels out of their sheaths, acutely aware of all those eyes upon him.\nHe took his mark opposite West, pushing his feet cautiously into the grass.\nWest raised his steels, Jezal did the same. They faced each other for a\nmoment, motionless.\n'Begin!' shouted Varuz.\nIt quickly became clear that West had no mind to roll over for him. He\ncame on with more than his usual ferocity, harrying Jezal with a flurry of\nheavy cuts, their steels clashing and scraping rapidly together. He gave\nground, still uncomfortable under the watchful eyes of all those people,\ndamned important people some of them, but as West pushed him back\ntowards the edge of the circle, his nerves began to fade, his training took\nover. He ducked away, making room for himself, parrying the cuts with left\nand right, dodging and dancing, too fast to catch.\nThe people faded, even Ardee was gone. The blades moved by\nthemselves, back and forth, up and down. There was no need for him to\nlook at them. He turned his attention to Wests eyes, watched them flicker\nfrom the ground to the steels to Jezal's dancing feet, trying to guess his\nintentions.\nHe felt the lunge coming even before it was begun. He feinted one way\nthen turned the other, slipping smoothly round behind West as he blundered\npast. It was a simple matter for him to apply his foot to the seat of his\nopponent's trousers and shove him out of the circle.\n'A touch!' shouted Marshal Varuz.\nThere was a ripple of laughter as the Major sprawled on his face. A\ntouch on the arse!' guffawed the Crown Prince, his plume waving back and\nforth with merriment. 'One to Captain Luthar!' West didn't look half so\nintimidating with his face in the dirt.

Jezal took his own mark, barely\nable to suppress his smile.\n'Begin!' shouted Varuz.\n'West came on strongly again, but Jezal was warming to his task now.\nThe sounds of the audience muttered and swelled as he danced this way and\nthat. He began to work the odd flourish into his movements, and the\nonlookers responded, 'oohs' and 'aahs' floating up as he flicked West's\nefforts away. He had never fenced so well, never moved so smoothly. The\nbigger man was starting to tire a little, the snap was going out of his cuts.\nTheir long steels clashed together, scraped. Jezal twisted his right wrist and\ntore West's blade from his fingers, stepped in and slashed at him with his\nleft.\n'Gah!' West winced and dropped his short steel, hopping away and\ngrabbing his forearm. A few drops of blood pattered across the ground.\n'Two to nothing!' shouted Varuz.\nThe Crown Prince jumped up, his hat tumbling off, delighted by the\nsight of blood.

He understood now what he had been\ntraining for.\n'Well fought, Jezal,' muttered West, a trickle of blood running down his\nforearm. 'You've got too good for me.'\n'Sorry about the cut.' Jezal grinned. He wasn't sorry in the least.\n'It's nothing. Just a scratch.' West strode away, frowning and holding his\nwrist. Nobody paid much attention to his exit, Jezal least of all. Sporting\nevents are all about the winners.\nLord Marovia was the first to get up from the benches and offer his\ncongratulations. 'What a promising young man,' he said, smiling warmly at\nJezal, 'but do you think he can beat Bremer dan Gorst?'\nVaruz gave Jezal a fatherly clap on the shoulder.

The High Justice raised his bushy eyebrows.\n'I look forward to seeing them meet. Have you ever considered a career in\nthe law, Captain Luthar?'\nJezal was taken by surprise. 'Er, no, your Worship, that is… I am a\nsoldier.'\n'Of course you are. But battles and so forth can play hell with the\nnerves.

'If you say so, Captain.'\n'I do.' Jezal turned rudely away, hoping that he never had occasion to\nspeak to the loathsome man again. He found himself staring straight into\nArdee's face, no more than a foot away.\n'Gah,' he stammered, stepping back again.\n'Jezal,' she said, 'I haven't seen you in a while.'\n'Er…' He glanced nervously around. Glokta was shambling away. West\nwas long gone. Varuz was busy holding forth to Lord Isher and a few others\nstill remaining in the courtyard. They were unobserved. He had to speak to\nher. He ought to tell her straight out that he could not see her anymore. He\nowed her that much. 'Er…'\n'Nothing to say to me?'\n'Er…' He turned swiftly on his heel and walked away, his shoulders\nprickling with shame.\nThe tedium of guard duty at the south gate seemed, after all that unexpected\nexcitement, almost a mercy. Jezal was quite looking forward to standing\nidly by, watching people file in and out of the Agriont, listening to\nLieutenant Kaspa's mindless babble. At least, he was until he got there.\nKaspa and the usual complement of armoured soldiers were clustered\naround the outer gates, where the old bridge across the moat passed\nbetween the two massive, white rendered towers of the gatehouse.

At his heels came a sickly-looking youth, head a\nlittle bowed as if in awe of the older man, holding a long staff out before\nhim in upturned palms. A great brute of a man in a heavy fur cloak followed\nbehind them, a good half head taller than the other two.\n'What the…' Jezal trailed off. He seemed to recognise the old man from\nsomewhere. Some lord perhaps, from the Open Council? Some foreign\nambassador? Certainly he had an air of majesty. Jezal racked his brains as\nthey approached, but could not place him.\nThe old man stopped before the gatehouse, swept Jezal, Kaspa, Morrow\nand the guards imperiously with glittering green eyes. 'Yoru,' he said.\nSulfur stepped forward, bowing low. 'Master Bayaz,' he murmured, in\nhushed tones of deep respect.\nAnd that was it. That was why Jezal knew the man. He bore a definite\nresemblance to the statue of Bayaz in the Kingsway. The statue Jezal had\nrun past so many times. A little fatter perhaps, but that expression: stern,\nwise, effortlessly commanding, was just the same. Jezal frowned. For the\nold man to be called by that name? He didn't like it. He didn't like the look\nof the lanky young man with the staff either.

Those that lived free in the far North,\nfighting, feuding, feasting, and doing whatever Northmen did, were of quite\na different kind. A tall, fierce, handsome people, Jezal had always imagined,\nwith a touch of romance about them. Strong, yet graceful. Wild, yet noble.\nSavage, yet cunning. The kind of men whose eyes are fixed always on the\nfar horizon.\nThis was not one of those.\nNever in his life had Jezal seen a more brutish-looking man. Even\nFenris the Feared had seemed civilised by comparison. His face was like a\nwhipped back, criss-crossed with ragged scars.\nHis nose was bent, pointing off a little sideways. One ear had a big\nnotch out of it, one eye seemed a touch higher than the other, surrounded by\na crescent-shaped wound. His whole face, in fact, was slightly beaten,\nbroken, lop-sided, like that of a prize fighter who has fought a few bouts too\nmany. His expression too, was that of one punch-drunk. He gawped up at\nthe gatehouse, forehead furrowed, mouth hanging open, staring about him\nwith a look of near animal stupidity.\nHe wore a long fur cloak, and a leather tunic set with gold, but this\nheight of barbaric splendour only made him look more savage, and there\nwas no missing the long, heavy sword at his belt. The Northman scratched\nat a big pink scar through the stubble on his cheek as he peered up at the\nsheer walls above, and Jezal noticed one of his fingers was missing. As\nthough any further evidence of a life of violence and savagery was\nnecessary.\nTo let this hulking primitive into the Agriont? While they were at war\nwith the Northmen? It was unthinkable! But Morrow was already sidling\nforward. 'The Lord Chamberlain is expecting you, gentlemen,' he gushed as\nhe bowed and scraped his way towards the old man, 'if you would care to\nfollow me—'\n'One moment.' Jezal grabbed the under-secretary by the elbow and\npulled him aside. 'Him too?' he asked incredulously, nodding over at the\nprimitive in the cloak. 'We are at war, you know!'\n'Lord Hoff was most specific!' Morrow shook his arm free, spectacles\nflashing. 'Keep him here if you wish, but you can explain it to the Lord\nChamberlain!'\nJezal swallowed. That idea was not at all appealing. He glanced up at\nthe old man, but could not look him in the eye for long. He had a\nmysterious air, an air of knowing something no one else could guess, and it\nwas most unsettling.\n'You… must… leave… your… weapons… here!' he shouted, speaking\nas slowly and clearly as possible.\n'Happy to.' The Northman pulled the sword from his belt and held it out.\nIt weighed heavily in Jezal's hands: a big, plain, brutal-looking weapon.

The\nNorthman smiled broadly. It was truly a hideous sight, the ragged scars\ntwisting and puckering, making his face more lopsided than ever.\n'You can never have too many knives,' he growled in a deep, grinding\nvoice. Nobody laughed, but he did not seem to care.\n'Shall we go?' asked the old man.\n'Without delay,' said Morrow, turning to leave.\n'I'll come with you.' Jezal dumped his armload of weapons into Kaspa's\nhands.\n'That really isn't necessary, Captain,' whined Morrow.\n'I insist.' Once he was delivered to the Lord Chamberlain, the Northman\ncould murder whomever he pleased: it would be someone else's problem.\nBut until he got there Jezal might be blamed for whatever mischief he got\nup to, and he was damned if he was going to let that happen.\nThe guards stood aside, the strange procession passed through the gate.\nMorrow was first, whispering obsequious nothings over his shoulder to the\nold man in the splendid robe. The pale youth was next, followed by Sulfur.\nThe nine-fingered Northman lumbered along at the back.\nJezal followed with his thumb in his belt, close to the hilt of his sword\nso he could get to it quickly, watching the savage intently for any sudden\nmoves. After following him for a short while though, Jezal had to admit, the\nman gave no appearance of having murder in mind. If anything he looked\ncurious, bemused, and somewhat embarrassed. He kept slowing, staring up\nat the buildings around him, shaking his head, scratching his face, muttering\nunder his breath. He would occasionally horrify passers-by by smiling at\nthem, but he seemed to present no greater threat and Jezal began to relax, at\nleast until they reached the Square of Marshals.\nThe Northman stopped suddenly. Jezal fumbled for his sword, but the\nprimitive's eyes were locked ahead, gazing at a fountain nearby. He moved\nslowly towards it, then cautiously raised a thick finger and poked at the\nglittering jet. Water splashed into his face and he blundered away, almost\nknocking Jezal down. 'A spring?' he whispered. 'But how?'\nMercy. The man was like a child. A six and a half foot child with a face\nlike a butcher's block. 'There are pipes!' Jezal stamped on the paving.\n'Beneath… the… ground!'\n'Pipes,' echoed the primitive quietly, staring at the frothing water.\nThe others had moved some way ahead, close to the grand building in\nwhich Hoff had his offices. Jezal began to step away from the fountain,\nhoping to draw the witless savage with him. To Jezal's relief he followed,\nshaking his head and muttering 'pipes' to himself, over and over.\nThey entered the cool darkness of the Lord Chamberlain's ante-room."

The\nspectacled secretary opened the heavy double doors and stood by while first\nthe old bald man, then his crony with the stick, then the madman Sulfur,\nand finally the nine-fingered primitive walked in past him.\nJezal made to follow them, but Morrow stood in the doorway and\nblocked his path. 'Thank you so much for your help, Captain,' he said with a\nthin smile. 'You may return to the gate.' Jezal peered over his shoulder into\nthe room beyond. He saw the Lord Chamberlain frowning behind a long\ntable. Arch Lector Sult was beside him, grim and suspicious. High Justice\nMarovia was there too, a smile on his wrinkled face. Three members of the\nClosed Council.\nThen Morrow shut the door in his face.\nNext\n« ^ »\n'I notice you have a new secretary,' said Glokta, as though just in passing.\nThe Arch Lector smiled. 'Of course. The old one was not to my liking.\nHe had a loose tongue, you know.' Glokta paused, his wine glass halfway to\nhis mouth. 'He had been passing our secrets on to the Mercers,' continued\nSult carelessly, as if it was common knowledge. 'I had been aware of it for\nsome time. You needn't worry though, he never learned anything I didn't\nwant him to know.'\nThen… you knew who our traitor was. You knew all along. Glokta's\nmind turned the events of the last few weeks around, pulled them apart and\nput them back together in this new light, trying them different ways until\nthey fit, all the while struggling to conceal his surprise. You left Rews\nconfession where you knew your secretary would see it. You knew the\nMercers would find out who was on the list, and you guessed what they\nwould do, knowing it would only play into your hands and give you the\nshovel with which to bury them. Meanwhile, you steered my suspicions\ntowards Kalyne when you knew who the leak was all along. The whole\nbusiness unfolded precisely according to your plan. The Arch Lector was\nlooking back at him with a knowing smile. And I bet you guess what I'm\nthinking right now. I have been almost as much a piece in this game as that\nsnivelling worm of a secretary. Glokta stifled a giggle. How fortunate for\nme that I was a piece on the right side. I never suspected a thing.\n'He betrayed us for a disappointingly small sum of money,' continued\nSult, his lip curling with distaste. 'I daresay Kault would have given him ten\ntimes as much, if he had only had the wit to ask. The younger generation\nreally have no ambition. They think they are a great deal cleverer than they\nare.' He studied Glokta with his cool blue eyes. I am part of the younger\ngeneration, more or less. I am justly humbled.\n'Your secretary has been disciplined?'"

It really\nisn't necessary to spare him any further thought.' I bet it isn't. Body found\nfloating by the docks… 'I must say, I was greatly surprised when you fixed\non Superior Kalyne as the source of our leak. The man was from the old\nguard. A few indulgences to look the other way over trifling matters, of\ncourse, but to betray the Inquisition? To sell our secrets to the Mercers?'\nSult snorted. 'Never. You allowed your personal dislike for the man to cloud\nyour judgement.'\n'He seemed the only possibility,' muttered Glokta, but immediately\nregretted it. Foolish, foolish. The mistake is made. Better just to keep your\nmouth shut.\n'Seemed?' The Arch Lector clicked his tongue in profound disapproval.\n'No, no, no, Inquisitor. Seemed is not good enough for us. In future, we'll\nhave just the facts, if you please. But don't feel too badly about it—I\nallowed you to follow your instincts and, as things have turned out, your\nblunder has left our position much the stronger. Kalyne has been removed\nfrom office,' Body found floating… 'and Superior Goyle is on his way from\nAngland to assume the role of Superior of Adua.'\nGoyle? Coming here? That bastard, the new Superior of Adua? Glokta\ncould not prevent his lip from curling.\n'The two of you are not the greatest of friends, eh, Glokta?'\n'He is a jailer, not an investigator. He is not interested in guilt or\ninnocence. He is not interested in truth. He tortures for the thrill of it.'\n'Oh, come now, Glokta. Are you telling me you feel no thrill when your\nprisoners spill their secrets? When they name the names? When they sign\nthe confession?'\n'I take no pleasure in it.' I take no pleasure in anything.\n'And yet you do it so very well. In any case, Goyle is coming, and\nwhatever you may think of him, he is one of us. A most capable and\ntrustworthy man, dedicated to the service of crown and state. He was once a\npupil of mine, you know.'\n'Really?'\n'Yes. He had your job… so there is some future in it after all!' The Arch\nLector giggled at his own joke. Glokta gave a thin smile of his own. 'All in\nall, things have worked out very nicely, and you are to be congratulated on\nyour part in it. A job well done.' Well enough done that I am still alive, at\nleast. Sult raised his glass and they drank a joyless toast together, eyeing\neach other suspiciously over the rims of their glasses.\nGlokta cleared his throat. 'Magister Kault mentioned something\ninteresting before his unfortunate demise.'\n'Go on.'\n'The Mercers had a partner in their schemes. A senior partner, perhaps.\nA bank.'"

A senior partner, perhaps.\nA bank.'\n'Huh. Turn a merchant over and there's always a banker underneath.\nWhat of it?'\n'I believe these bankers knew about it all. The smuggling, the fraud, the\nmurders even. I believe they encouraged it, maybe ordered it, so that they\ncould get a good return on their loans. May I begin an investigation, your\nEminence?'\n'Which bank?'\n'Valint and Balk.'\nThe Arch Lector seemed to consider a moment, staring at Glokta\nthrough his hard, blue eyes. Does he already know about these particular\nbankers? Does he already know much more than me? What did Kault say?\nYou want traitors, Glokta? Look in the House of Questions—\n'No,' snapped Sult. 'Those particular bankers are well connected. They\nare owed too many favours, and without Kault it will be difficult to prove\nanything. We got what we needed from the Mercers, and I have a more\npressing task for you.'\nGlokta looked up. Another task? 'I was looking forward to interviewing\nthe prisoners we took at the Guildhall, your Eminence, it may be that—'\n'No.' The Arch Lector swatted Glokta's words away with his gloved\nhand. 'That business could drag on for months. I will have Goyle handle it.'\nHe frowned. 'Unless you object?'\nSo I plough the field, sow the seed, water the crop, then Goyle reaps the\nharvest? Some justice. He humbly bowed his head. 'Of course not, your\nEminence.'\n'Good. You are probably aware of the unusual visitors we received\nyesterday.'\nVisitors? For the past week Glokta had been in agony with his back.\nYesterday he had struggled out of bed to watch that cretin Luthar fence, but\notherwise he had been confined to his tiny room, virtually unable to move.\n'I hadn't noticed,' he said simply.\n'Bayaz, the First of the Magi.' Glokta gave his thin smile again, but the\nArch Lector was not laughing.\n'You're joking, of course.'\n'If only.'\n'A charlatan, your Eminence?'\n'What else? But a most extraordinary one. Lucid, reasonable, clever.\nThe deception is elaborate in the extreme.'\n'You have spoken with him?'\n'I have. He is remarkably convincing. He knows things, things he\nshouldn't know. He cannot be simply dismissed. Whoever he is, he has\nfunding, and good sources of information.' The Arch Lector frowned deep.\n'He has some renegade brute of a Northman with him.'\nGlokta frowned. 'A Northman? It hardly seems their style. They strike\nme as most direct.'\n'My very thoughts.'\n'A spy for the Emperor then? The Gurkish?'\n'Perhaps. The Kantics love a good intrigue, but they tend to stick to the\nshadows. These theatricals don't seem to have their mark. I suspect our\nanswer may lie closer to home.'\n'The nobles, your Eminence?

He's\nplotting something, I can tell.'\nThe nobles, the High Justice, the Northmen, the Gurkish—it could be\nany one of them, or none—but why? 'I don't understand, Arch Lector. If they\nare simply spies, why go to all this trouble? Surely there are easier ways to\nget into the Agriont?'\n'This is the thing.' Sult gave as bitter a grimace as Glokta had ever seen.\n'There is an empty seat on the Closed Council, there always has been. A\npointless tradition, a matter of etiquette, a chair reserved for a mythical\nfigure, in any case dead for hundreds of years. Nobody ever supposed that\nanyone would come forward to claim it.'\n'But he has?'\n'He has! He has demanded it!' The Arch Lector got to his feet and strode\naround the table. 'I know! Unthinkable! Some spy, some liar from who\nknows where, privy to the workings of the very heart of our government!\nBut he has some dusty papers, so it falls to us to discredit him! Can you\nbelieve it?'\nGlokta could not. But there hardly seems any purpose to saying so.\n'I have asked for time to investigate,' continued Sult, 'but the Closed\nCouncil will not be put off indefinitely. We have only a week or two to\nexpose this so-called Magus for the fraud he is. In the mean time, he and his\ncompanions are making themselves at home in an excellent suite of rooms\nin the Tower of Chains, and there is nothing we can do to prevent them\nwandering the Agriont, causing whatever mischief they please!' There is\nsomething we could do…\n'The Tower of Chains is very high. If somebody were to fall—'\n'No. Not yet. We have already pushed our luck as far as it will go in\ncertain circles. For the time being at least, we must tread carefully.'\n'There is always the possibility of an interrogation. If we were to arrest\nthem, I could soon find out who they are working for—'\n'Tread carefully, I said! I want you to look into this Magus, Glokta, and\nhis companions. Find out who they are, where they come from, what they\nare after. Above all, find out who is behind them, and why. We must\ndiscredit this would-be Bayaz before he can do any damage. After that you\ncan use whatever means you please.' Sult turned and moved away to the\nwindow.\nGlokta got up awkwardly, painfully from his chair. 'How shall I begin?'\n'Follow them!' shouted the Arch Lector impatiently. 'Watch them! See\nwho they speak to, what they are about. You're the Inquisitor, Glokta!' he\nsnapped, without even looking round. 'Ask some questions!'\nBetter than Death\n« ^ »\n'We're looking for a woman,' said the officer, staring at them suspiciously."

'Tall, with a\nscar, hair cropped short. Well-armed, most likely, with a bow.' Ferro stood\nthere, tall and scarred, hair cropped short, bow over her shoulder, and\nlooked down at the dusty ground. 'She is wanted, by the highest of\nauthorities! A thief and a murderer, many times over!'\nYulwei gave a humble smile and spread his hands. 'We have seen no\nsuch person master.

The officer didn't seem to notice though.\nHe swatted at a fly as Yulwei blathered on. 'Neither one of us would know\nwhat to do with such a thing as a bow, I can assure you. We trust in God to\nprotect us, master, and in the Emperors matchless soldiers.'\nThe officer snorted. 'Very wise, old man. What's your business here?'\n'I am a merchant, on my way to Dagoska, to purchase spices,' and he\ngave a grovelling bow, 'with your kind permission.'\n'Trading with the pinks are you? Damn Union!' The officer spat in the\ndust. 'Still, a man has to make a living, I suppose, if a shameful one. Trade\nwhile you can, the pinks will be gone soon, swept back into the ocean!' He\npuffed out his chest with pride. 'The Emperor, Uthman-ul-Dosht, has sworn\nit! What do you think of that, old man?'\n'Oh, it will be a great day, a great day,' said Yulwei, bowing low again,\n'may God bring it to us soon, master!'\nThe officer looked Ferro up and down. 'Your son looks a strong lad.\nPerhaps he'd make a soldier.' He took a step towards her and grabbed hold\nof her bare arm. 'That's a strong arm. That arm could draw a bow, I'd say, if\nit were taught. What do you say, boy? A man's work, fighting for the glory\nof God, and your Emperor! Better than grubbing for a pittance!' Ferro's\nflesh crawled where his fingers touched her skin. Her other hand crept\ntowards her knife.\n'Alas,' said Yulwei quickly, 'my son was born… simple. He scarcely\nspeaks.'\n'Ah. A shame. The time may come when we need every man. Savages\nthey may be, but these pinks can fight.' The officer turned away and Ferro\nscowled after him. 'Very well, you may go!' He waved them on.

'You're quite a character alright.\nQuite a character.'\nFerro scowled as she followed the old man up the hill. She wasn't\nlooking to be anyone's character. Yulwei could make these soldiers see\nwhatever he pleased, and that was a smart trick, but she'd be damned if she\nwas going north.

A high wall enclosed neat rows of buildings, enough to\nmake a small town. Next to the them, built out into the water, were long\nwharves. Moored to the wharves were ships.\nHuge ships.\nTowers of wood, floating fortresses. Ferro had never seen ships half that\nsize. Their masts were a dark forest against the bright water behind. Ten\nwere docked below them, and further out in the bay two more were cutting\nslowly through the waves, great sails billowing, tiny figures crawling on the\ndecks and in amongst the spider's web of ropes above.\n'I see twelve,' murmured Yulwei, 'but your eyes are the sharper.'\nFerro looked out across the water. Further round the curving shore,\ntwenty miles away perhaps, she could see another fortress, another set of\nwharves. 'There are more over there,' she said, 'eight or nine, and those ones\nare bigger.'\n'Bigger than these?'\n'A lot bigger.'\n'God's breath!' muttered Yulwei to himself. 'The Gurkish never built\nships so big before, not half so big, nor half so many. There is not the wood\nin all the South for such a fleet. They must have bought it from the north,\nfrom the Styrians, maybe.'\nFerro cared nothing for boats, or wood, or the north. 'So?'\n'With a fleet this size, the Gurkish will be a power at sea. They could\ntake Dagoska from the bay, invade Westport even.'\nThe pointless names of far-away places. 'So?'\n'You don't understand, Ferro. I must warn the others. We must make\nhaste, now!' He pushed himself up from the ground and hurried back\ntowards the road.\nFerro grunted. She watched the big wooden tubs moving back and forth\nin the bay for a moment longer, then she got up and followed Yulwei. Great\nships or tiny ships, it meant nothing to her.

A hundred or more. Six\nguards rode alongside them, easy in their tall saddles, whips rolled up in\ntheir hands.\n'Slaves.'

'On your\nfeet!' The old man struggled in the dust. 'Move!' The soldier's whip cracked,\nleaving a long red mark across the man's scrawny back.

The whip cracked\nagain, catching them both, and there was a yelp of pain. Was it the girl or\nthe man who had cried out?\nOr had it been Ferro herself?\nShe shook Yulwei's hand off, reaching for an arrow. 'I can kill this\nbastard!' she snarled. The soldier's head snapped round to look at them,\ncurious. Yulwei seized hold of her hand.\n'What then?' he hissed. 'If you killed all six of them, what then? Have\nyou food and water for a hundred slaves? Eh? You have it well concealed!\nAnd when the column is missed? Eh? And their guards found slaughtered?\nWhat then, killer? Will you hide a hundred slaves out here? Because I\ncannot!'\nFerro stared into Yulwei's black eyes, her teeth grinding together, her\nbreath snorting fast through her nose. She wondered whether or not to try\nand kill him again.\nNo.\nHe was right, damn him. Slowly, she pushed the anger back, as far\ndown as it would go. She shoved the arrow away, and turned back towards\nthe column. She watched the old slave stumble on, and the girl after him,\nfury gnawing at her guts like hunger.\n'You!' called the soldier, nudging his horse over towards them.\n'You've done it now!' hissed Yulwei, then he bowed to the guard,\nsmiling, scraping.

The soldier waved his helmet around in frustration. 'Use\nher gently, in five years she'll be worth more! It's an investment!'\nThe soldier's face was just a few feet away. She could see each tiny bead\nof sweat forming on his forehead, each stubbly hair on his cheeks, each\nblemish, nick, and pore on his skin. She could smell him, almost.\nThe truly thirsty will drink piss, or salt water, or oil, however bad for\nthem, so great is their need to drink. Ferro had seen it often in the badlands.\nThat was the extent of her need to kill this man now. She wanted to tear him\nwith her bare hands, to choke the life from him, to rip his face with her\nteeth. The desire was almost too strong to resist. 'Peace!' hissed Yulwei.\n'I can't afford her,' Ferro heard herself saying.\n'You might have said so before, boy, and saved me the trouble!' The\nsoldier stuck his helmet back on. 'Still, I can't blame you for looking. She's\na good one.' He reached down and grabbed the girl under the arm, dragging\nher back towards the others. 'They'll get twenty for her in Shaffa!' he"

The column moved on. Ferro watched the girl\nuntil the slaves disappeared over a rise, stumbling, limping, shambling\ntowards slavery.\nShe felt cold now, cold and empty. She wished she had killed the guard,\nwhatever the cost. Killing him could have filled that empty space, if only\nfor a while. That was how it worked. 'I walked in a column like that,' she\nsaid slowly.\nYulwei gave a long sigh. 'I know, Ferro, I know, but fate has chosen you\nfor saving. Be grateful for it, if you know how.'\n'You should have let me kill him.'\n'Eugh,' clucked the old man in disgust, 'I do declare, you'd kill the whole\nworld if you could. Is there anything but killing in you Ferro?'\n'There used to be,' she muttered, 'but they whip it out of you. They whip\nyou until they're sure there's nothing left.' Yulwei stood there, with that\npitying look on his face. Strange, how it didn't make her angry any more.\n'I'm sorry, Ferro. Sorry for you and for them.' He stepped back into the\nroad, shaking his head. 'But it's better than death.'\nShe stayed for a moment, watching the dust rising from the distant\ncolumn.\n'The same,' she whispered to herself.\nSore Thumb\n« ^ »\nLogen leaned against the parapet, squinted into the morning sun, and took\nin the view.\nHe'd done the same, it felt long ago now, from the balcony of his room\nat the library. The two views could hardly have been more different. Sunrise\nover the jagged carpet of buildings on the one hand, hot and glaring bright\nand full of distant noise. The cold and misty valley on the other, soft and\nempty and still as death. He remembered that morning, remembered how\nhe'd felt like a different man. He certainly felt a different man now. A stupid\nman. Small, scared, ugly, and confused.\n'Logen.' Malacus stepped out onto the balcony to stand beside him,\nsmiled up at the sun and out over the city to the sparkling bay, already busy\nwith ships. 'Beautiful, isn't it?'\n'If you say so, but I'm not sure I see it. All those people.' Logen gave a\nsweaty shiver. 'It's not right. It frightens me.'\n'Frightened? You?'\n'Always.' Logen had barely slept since they arrived. It was never\nproperly dark here, never properly quiet. It was too hot, too close, too\nstinking. Enemies might be terrifying, but enemies could be fought, and put\nan end to. Logen could understand their hatred. There was no fighting the\nfaceless, careless, rumbling city. It hated everything. 'This is no place for\nme. I'll be glad to leave.'\n'We might not be leaving for a while.'\n'I know.' Logen took a deep breath. 'That's why I'm going to go down\nand look at this Agriont, and find out what I can about it. Some things have"

It's better to do them than to live with the fear of them. That's\nwhat my father used to tell me.'\n'Good advice. I'll come with you.'\n'You will not.' Bayaz was in the doorway, glaring out at his apprentice.\n'Your progress over the last few weeks has been a disgrace, even for you.'\nHe stepped through into the open air. 'I suggest that while we are idle,\nwaiting on His Majesty's pleasure, you should take the opportunity to study.\nAnother such chance may be a long time coming.'\nMalacus hurried back inside with no backward glances. He knew better\nthan to dawdle with his master in this mood. Bayaz had lost all his good\nhumour as soon as they arrived at the Agriont, and it didn't look like coming\nback. Logen could hardly blame him, they'd been treated more like\nprisoners than guests. He didn't know much about manners, but he could\nguess the meaning of hard stares from everyone and guards outside the\ndoor.\n'You wouldn't believe how it's grown,' growled Bayaz, frowning out at\nthe great sweep of city. 'I remember when Adua was barely more than a\nhuddle of shacks, squeezed in round the House of the Maker like flies round\na fresh turd. Before there was an Agriont. Before there was a Union, even.\nThey weren't half so proud in those days, I can tell you. They worshipped\nthe Maker like a god.'\nHe noisily hawked up a lump of phlegm and spat it out into the air.\nLogen watched it clear the moat and vanish somewhere in amongst the\nwhite buildings below. 'I gave them this,' hissed Bayaz. Logen felt the\nunpleasant creeping sensation that always seemed to accompany the old\nwizard's displeasure. 'I gave them freedom, and this is the thanks I get? The\nscorn of clerks? Of swollen-headed old errand-boys?' A trip down into the\nsuspicion and madness below began to seem like a merciful release. Logen\nedged towards the door and ducked back into the room beyond.\nIf they were prisoners here then Logen had been in some harder cells,\nhe had to admit. Their round living room was fit for a King, to his mind at\nleast: heavy chairs of dark wood with delicate carvings, thick hangings on\nthe walls showing woods and hunting scenes. Bethod would most likely\nhave felt at home in such a room. Logen felt like an oaf there, always on his\ntoes in case he broke something. A tall jar stood on a table in the chamber's\ncentre, its sides painted with bright flowers. Logen eyed it suspiciously as\nhe made for the long stair down into the Agriont.\n'Logen!' Bayaz was framed in the doorway, frowning after him. 'Take\ncare. The place may seem strange, but the people are stranger still.'\nThe water frothed and gurgled, spurting up in a narrow jet from a metal\ntube carved like a fish's mouth, then splashing back down into a wide stone"

A fountain, the proud young man had called it. Pipes, beneath the\nearth, he'd said. Logen pictured underground streams, coursing just beneath\nhis feet, washing at the foundations of the place. The thought made him feel\nslightly dizzy.\nThe square was vast—a great plain of flat stones, hemmed in by sheer\ncliffs of white buildings. Hollow cliffs, covered with pillars and carvings,\nglittering with tall windows, crawling with people. Something strange\nseemed to be happening today. All around the distant edges of the square an\nenormous, sloping structure of wooden beams was being built. An army of\nworkmen swarmed over it, hacking and bludgeoning, swinging at pegs and\njoints, hurling bad-tempered shouts at each other. All around them were\nmountains of planks and logs, barrels of nails, stacks of tools, enough to\nbuild ten mighty halls, and more besides. In places the structure was already\nfar above the ground, its uprights soaring into the air like the masts of great\nships, as high as the monstrous buildings behind.\nLogen stood, hands on hips, gawping at the enormous wooden skeleton,\nbut its purpose was a mystery. He stepped up to a short muscular man in a\nleather apron, sawing furiously at a plank. 'What's this?'\n'Eh?' The man didn't even look up from his task.\n'This. What's it for?'\nThe saw bit through the wood, the off-cut clattered to the ground. The\ncarpenter hefted the rest of the plank onto a pile nearby. He turned round,\neyeing Logen suspiciously, wiping sweat from his glistening forehead.\n'Stands. Seating.' Logen stared vacantly back at him. How could\nsomething stand and sit at once? 'For the Contest!' the carpenter shouted in\nhis face. Logen backed slowly away. Gibberish. Nonsense words. He turned\nand hurried off, keeping well clear of the huge wooden structures and the\nmen clambering over them.\nHe blundered out onto a broad lane, a deep gorge between looming\nwhite buildings. Statues faced each other down either side, much larger than\nlife, frowning over the heads of the many people hurrying between. The\nnearest of the carvings seemed strangely familiar. Logen walked over to it,\nlooked it up and down, then grinned to himself. The First of the Magi had\ngained some weight since it was sculpted. Too much good eating at the\nlibrary, maybe. Logen turned towards a small man with a black hat, walking\nby with a big book under his arm.\n'Bayaz,' he said, pointing up at the statue. 'Friend of mine.' The man\nstared at him, at the statue, back at him, and hurried away.\nThe carvings marched on down either side of the avenue. Kings of the\nUnion, Logen guessed, stood in line on the left. Some carried swords, some\nscrolls or tiny ships. One had a dog at his feet, another a sheaf of wheat\nunder his arm, but otherwise there wasn't much to tell them apart. They all"

They all\nhad the same tall crowns and the same stern frowns. You wouldn't have\nthought to look at them that they'd ever said a stupid word, or done a stupid\nthing, or had to take a shit in all their lives.\nLogen heard rapid footsteps thumping up behind him, and he turned just\nin time to see the proud young man from the gate, pounding down the\navenue, shirt soaked through with sweat. Logen wondered where he might\nbe going in such a hurry, but he was damned if he was going to run to catch\nup with him, not in this heat. Anyway, there were plenty more mysteries\nthat needed solving.\nThe lane opened out into a great, green space, scooped out from the\ncountry by giant hands and dropped in amongst the tall buildings, but like\nno countryside that Logen had ever seen. The grass was a smooth, even\nblanket of vivid green, shaved almost to the ground. There were flowers,\nbut growing in rows and circles and straight lines of bright colour. There\nwere lush bushes and trees, all squeezed and fenced and clipped into\nunnatural shapes. There was water, too—streams bubbling over stone steps,\na great flat pond with sad-looking trees trailing round its edge.\nLogen wandered through this square-edged greenery, boots crunching\non a path made of tiny grey stones. There were lots of people gathered here,\nsqueezed in together to enjoy the sun. They sat in boats on the miniature\nlake, rowing gently round and round, going nowhere. They lazed on the\nlawns, ate, drank and babbled to one another. Some of them would point at\nLogen and shout, or whisper, or slope away.\nThey were a strange-seeming crowd, especially the women. Pale and\nghostly, swaddled in elaborate dresses, hair scraped up and piled and stuck\nthrough with pins and combs and great weird feathers or useless tiny hats.\nThey seemed like the big jar in the round chamber—too thin and delicate to\nbe any use, and further spoiled by too much decoration. But it had been a\nlong time, and he smiled at them cheerfully, on the off chance. Some looked\nshocked, others gasped in horror. Logen sighed. The old magic was still\nthere.\nFurther on, in another wide square, Logen stopped to watch a group of\nsoldiers practice. These weren't beggars, or girlish youths, these were solid-\nlooking men wearing heavy armour, breastplates and greaves polished\nmirror bright, long spears shouldered. They stood together, each man the\nsame as the one beside, in four squares of maybe fifty men each, still as the\nstatues in the avenue.\nAt a bellow from a short man in a red jacket—their chief, Logen\nreckoned—the whole crowd turned, levelled their spears and began to\nadvance across the square, heavy boots tramping together. Each man the\nsame, armed the same, moving the same. It was quite a sight, all that\nshining metal moving steadily in bristling squares, spear points glittering,\nlike some great square hedgehog with two hundred legs. Deadly enough, no"

Deadly enough, no\ndoubt, on a big flat space, against an imaginary enemy right in front. How it\nwould work on broken rocks, in the tipping rain, in a tangled wood, Logen\nwas less sure. Those men would tire quickly, in all that weight of armour,\nand if the squares could be broken, what would they do? Men who were\nused to always having others at their shoulder? Could they fight alone?\nHe plodded on, through wide courtyards and neat gardens, past gurgling\nfountains and proud statues, down clean lanes and broad avenues. He\nwandered up and down narrow stairways, across bridges over streams, over\nroads, over other bridges. He saw guards in a dozen different splendid\nliveries, guarding a hundred different gates and walls and doors, every one\neyeing him with the same deep suspicion. The sun climbed in the sky, the\ntall white buildings slid by until Logen was footsore and half lost, his neck\naching from looking always upwards.\nThe only constant was the monstrous tower which loomed high, high\nover everything else, making the greatest of the great buildings seem mean.\nIt was always there, glimpsed out of the corner of your eye, peering over\nthe tops of the roofs in the distance. Logen's footsteps dragged him slowly\ncloser and closer to it, until he came to a neglected corner of the citadel in\nits very shadow.\nHe found an old bench beside a ragged lawn near a great crumbling\nbuilding, coated with moss and ivy, its steep roofs sagging in the middles\nand missing tiles. He slumped down, puffing out his cheeks, and frowned\nup at that enormous shape beyond the walls, cut out dark against the blue, a\nman made mountain of dry, stark, dead stones. No plants clung to that\nlooming mass, not even a clump of moss in the cracks between the great\nblocks. The House of the Maker, Bayaz had called it. It looked like no\nhouse that Logen had ever seen. There were no roofs above, no doors or\nwindows in those naked walls. A cluster of mighty, sharp-edged tiers of\nrock. What need could there ever be to build a thing so big? Who was this\nMaker anyway? Was this all he made? A great big, useless house?\n'You mind if I sit?' There was a woman looking down at Logen, more\nwhat he would have called a woman than those strange, ghostly things in\nthe park. A pretty woman in a white dress, face framed by dark hair.\n'Do I mind? No. It's a funny thing, but no one else wants to sit with me.'\nShe dropped down at the far end of the bench, resting her chin on her\nhands, her elbows on her knees, gazing up without interest at the looming\ntower. 'Perhaps they're afraid of you.'\nLogen watched a man hurry past with a sheaf of papers under his arm,\nstaring at him with wide eyes. 'I'm starting to think the same thing.'\n'You do look a little dangerous.'\n'Hideous is the word you're looking for.'\n'I usually find the words I'm looking for, and I say dangerous.'\n'Well, looks can lie.'"

'You must be a\nman of peace then.'\n'Huh… not entirely.' They looked at each other sidelong. She didn't\nseem afraid, or scornful, or even interested. 'Why aren't you scared?'\n'I'm from Angland, I know your people. Besides,' and she let her head\ndrop onto the back of the bench, 'no one else will talk to me. I'm desperate.'\nLogen stared at the stump of his middle finger, waggled it back and\nforth as far as it would go. 'You'd have to be. I'm Logen.'\n'Good for you. I'm nobody'\n'Everybody's somebody.'\n'Not me. I'm nothing. I'm invisible.'\nLogen frowned at her, turned sideways to him, lounging back on the\nbench in the sun, her long smooth neck stretched out, chest rising and\nfalling gently. 'I see you.'\nShe rolled her head to look at him. 'You… are a gentleman.'\nLogen snorted with laughter. He'd been called a lot of things in his time,\nbut never that. The young woman didn't join him in his amusement. 'I don't\nbelong here,' she muttered to herself.\n'Neither one of us.'\n'No. But this is my home.' She got up from the bench. 'Goodbye,\nLogen.'\n'Fare you well, nobody' He watched her turn and walk slowly away,\nshaking his head. Bayaz had been right. The place was strange, but the\npeople were stranger still.\nLogen woke with a painful start, blinked and stared wildly about him. Dark.\nNot quite entirely dark, of course, there was still the ever-present glow of\nthe city. He thought he'd heard something, but there was nothing now. It\nwas hot. Hot and close and strangling, even with the sticky draught from the\nopen window. He groaned, threw the damp blankets down around his waist,\nrubbed the sweat from his chest and wiped it on the wall behind him. The\nlight nagged at his eyelids. And that was not the worst of his problems. Say\none thing for Logen Ninefingers, say that he needs to piss.\nUnfortunately, you couldn't just piss in a pot in this place. They had a\nspecial thing, like a flat wooden shelf with a hole in it, in a little room. He'd\npeered down into that hole when they first arrived, wondering what it could\nbe for. It seemed like a long way down, and it smelled bad. Malacus had\nexplained it to him. A pointless and barbaric invention. You had to sit there,\non the hard wood, an unpleasant draught blowing round your fruits. But that\nwas civilisation, so far as Logen could tell. People with nothing better to do,\ndreaming up ways to make easy things difficult.\nHe floundered out of bed and picked his way to where he remembered\nthe door being, bent over with his arms feeling about in front of him. Too\nlight to sleep, but too dark to actually see anything. 'Fucking civilisation,' he"

The cold air felt good on his bare skin\nafter the damp heat of his bedroom. Why wasn't he sleeping in here, instead\nof that oven next door? He squinted at the shadowy walls, face all screwed\nup with the painful fuzz of sleep, trying to work out which blurry door led\nto the pissing-shelf. Knowing his luck he'd probably blunder into Bayaz'\nroom and accidentally piss on the First of the Magi while he was asleep.\nThat would be just the thing to sweeten the wizard's temper.\nHe took a step forward. There was a clunk and a rattle as his leg barged\ninto the corner of the table. He cursed, grabbing at his bruised shin—then\nhe remembered the jar. He lunged and caught it by the rim just before it fell.\nHis eyes were adjusting to the half-light now, and he could just make out\nthe flowers painted on the cold, shiny surface. He moved to put it back on\nthe table, but then it occurred to him. Why go any further when he had a\nperfectly good pot right there? He glanced furtively round the room,\nswinging the jar into position… then froze.\nHe was not alone.\nA tall, slender figure, vague in the half-light. He could just make out\nlong hair, blowing gently in the breeze from the open window. He strained\nagainst the darkness, but he couldn't see the face.\n'Logen…' A woman's voice, soft and low. He didn't like the sound of it\none bit. It was cold in the room, very cold. He took a firm grip on the jar.\n'Who are you?' he croaked, voice suddenly loud in the dead stillness.\nWas he dreaming? He shook his head, squeezed the jar in his hand. It all felt\nreal. Horribly real.\n'Logen…' The woman moved silently towards him. Soft light from the\nwindow caught the side of her face. A white cheek, a shadowy eye-socket,\nthe corner of a mouth, then sunk in darkness again. There was something\nfamiliar… Logen's mind fumbled for it as he backed away, eyes fixed on\nher outline, keeping the table between them.\n'What do you want?' He had a cold feeling in his chest, a bad feeling.\nHe knew he should be shouting for help, raising the others, but somehow he\nhad to know who it was. Had to know. The air was freezing, Logen could\nalmost see his breath smoking before his face. His wife was dead, he knew\nthat, dead and cold and gone back to the mud, long ago and far away. He'd\nseen the village, burned to ashes, full of corpses. His wife was dead… and\nyet…\n'Thelfi?' he whispered.\n'Logen…' Her voice! Her voice! His mouth dropped open.

The\nhand reached out, fingers spreading wide.\nSuddenly, the room was bright as day. Brighter. Brilliant, searing bright.\nThe murky outlines of the doors, the furniture, were transformed into hard\nwhite edges, black shadows. Logen squeezed his eyes shut, shielded them\nwith his arm, dropped back gasping against the wall. There was a deafening\ncrash like a landslide, a tearing and splintering like a great tree falling, a\nstink of burning wood. Logen opened one eye a crack, peered out from\nbetween his fingers.\nThe chamber was strangely altered. Dark, once more, but less dark than\nbefore. Light filtered in through a great ragged hole in the wall where the\nwindow used to be. Two of the chairs had gone, a third teetered on three\nlegs, broken edges glowing faintly, smouldering like sticks that had been a\nlong time in a fire. The table, standing right beside him just a moment\nbefore, was sheared in half on the other side of the room. Part of the ceiling\nhad been torn away from the rafters and the floor was littered with chunks\nof stone and plaster, broken lengths of wood and fragments of glass. Of the\nstrange woman there was no sign.\nBayaz picked his way unsteadily through the wreckage towards the\ngaping hole in the wall, nightshirt flapping around his thick calves, and\npeered out into the night. 'It's gone.'\n'It?' Logen stared at the steaming hole. 'She knew my name…'\nThe wizard stumbled over to the last remaining intact chair and flung\nhimself into it like a man exhausted. 'An Eater, perhaps. Sent by Khalul.'\n'A what?' asked Logen, baffled. 'Sent by who?'\nBayaz wiped sweat from his face. 'You wanted not to know.'\n'That's true.' Logen couldn't deny it. He rubbed at his chin, staring out of\nthe ragged patch of night sky, wondering whether now might be a good\ntime to change his mind. But by then it was too late. There was a frantic\nhammering at the door.\n'Get that, would you?' Logen stumbled stupidly through the debris and\nslid back the bolt. An angry-looking guard shouldered his way past, a lamp\nin one hand, drawn sword in the other.\n'There was a noise!' The light from his lamp swept over the wreckage,\nfound the ragged edge of the ripped plaster, the broken stone, the empty\nnight sky beyond. 'Shit,' he whispered.\n'We had an uninvited guest,' muttered Logen.\n'Er… I must notify…' the guard looked thoroughly confused '…\nsomebody.' He tripped and nearly fell over a fallen beam as he backed\ntowards the door. Logen heard his footsteps rattling away down the stairs.\n'What's an Eater?' There was no reply.

'I made sure I found it out. Her\nbrother's with the King's Own… West, something West…'\n'Ardee.'\n'That's the one! You know her?'\n'Hmm.' Glokta licked at his empty gums. She asked me how I was. I\nremember. 'What did they have to talk about?'\nThe Practical raised his eyebrows. 'Probably nothing. She's from\nAngland though, not been in the city long. Might be some connection. You\nwant me to bring her in? We could soon find out.'\n'No!' snapped Glokta. 'No. No need. Her brother used to be a friend of\nmine.'\n'Used to be.'\n'No one touches her, Severard, you hear?'\nThe Practical shrugged. 'If you say so, Inquisitor. If you say so.'\n'I do.'\nThere was a pause. 'So we're done with the Mercers then, are we?'\nSeverard sounded almost wistful.\n'It would seem so. They're finished. Nothing but some cleaning up to\ndo.'\n'Some lucrative cleaning up, I daresay.'\n'I daresay,' said Glokta sourly. 'But his Eminence feels our talents will\nbe better used elsewhere.' Like watching fake wizards. 'Hope you didn't lose\nout on your little property by the docks.'\nSeverard shrugged. 'I wouldn't be surprised if you need somewhere\naway from prying eyes again, before too long. It'll still be there. At the right\nprice. Shame to leave a job half done is all.'\nTrue. Glokta paused for a moment, considering. Dangerous. The Arch\nLector said go no further. Very dangerous, to disobey, and yet I smell\nsomething. It niggles, to leave a loose end, whatever his Eminence might\nsay. 'There might be one more thing.'\n'Really?'\n'Yes, but keep it subtle. Do you know anything about banks?'\n'Big buildings. They lend people money.'\nGlokta gave a thin smile. 'I had no idea you were such an expert. There's\none in particular I'm interested in.

I mean it.'\n'Discretion is what I'm all about, chief, ask anyone. Discreet. That's me.\nKnown for it.'\n'You'd better be, Severard. You had better be.'

Every tiniest\nmovement was a mighty task. He remembered how Marshal Varuz had\nmade him run up and down these steps when he was training for the\nContest, years ago. I took them three at a time, up and down without a\nsecond thought. Now look at me. Who would have thought it could come to\nthis?\nHis trembling body ran with sweat, his stinging eyes ran with tears, his\nburning nose dripped watery snot. All this water flowing out of me, and yet\nI'm thirsty as hell. Where's the sense in that? Where was the sense in any of\nit? What if someone should come past, and see me like this? The terrifying\nscourge of the Inquisition, flopped on his arse in a window, barely able to\nmove? Will I force a nonchalant smile onto this rigid mask of agony? Will I\npretend that all is well? That I often come here, to sprawl beside the stairs?\nOr will I weep and scream and beg for help?\nBut no one passed. He lay there, wedged in that narrow space, three-\nquarters of the way up the Tower of Chains, the back of his head resting on\nthe cool stones, his trembling knees drawn up in front of him. Sand dan\nGlokta, master swordsman, dashing cavalry officer, what glorious future\nmight he have in front of him? There was a time when I could run for hours.\nRun and run and never tire. He could feel a trickle of sweat running down\nhis back. Why do I do this? Why the hell would anyone do this? I could stop\ntoday. I could go home to mother. But then what? Then what?\n'Inquisitor, I'm glad you're here.'\nGood for you, bastard. I'm not. Glokta leaned against the wall at the top\nof the stairs, such teeth as he had grinding against his gums.\n'They're inside, it's quite a mess…' Glokta's hand trembled, the tip of his\ncane rattling against the stones. His head swam. The guard was blurry and\ndim through his twitching eyelids. 'Are you alright?' He loomed forwards,\none arm outstretched.\nGlokta looked up. 'Just get the fucking door, fool!'\nThe man jumped away, hurried to the door and pushed it open. Every\npart of Glokta longed to give up and sprawl on his face, but he willed\nhimself upright. He forced one foot before the other, forced his breath to\ncome even, forced his shoulders back and his head high, and swept\nimperiously past the guard, every part of his body singing with pain. What\nhe saw beyond the doors almost broke his veneer of composure however.\nYesterday these were some of the finest rooms in the Agriont. They were\nreserved for the most honoured of guests, the most important of foreign\ndignitaries. Yesterday.

A section of the ceiling had collapsed, broken timbers and\nshreds of plaster hanging down into the room. The floor was strewn with\nchunks of stone, splinters of glass, torn fragments of coloured cloth. The\nantique furniture had been smashed to scattered pieces, broken edges\ncharred and blackened as if by fire. Only one chair, half a table, and a tall\nornamental jar, strangely pristine in the middle of the rubble-strewn floor,\nhad escaped the destruction.\nIn the midst of this expensive wreckage stood a confused and sickly-\nseeming young man. He looked up as Glokta picked his—way through the\nrubble round the doorway, tongue darting nervously over his lips, evidently\non edge. Has anyone ever looked more of a fraud?\n'Er, good morning?' The young man's fingers twitched nervously at his\ngown, a heavy thing, stitched with arcane symbols. And doesn't he look\nuncomfortable in it? If this man is a wizard's apprentice, I am the Emperor\nof Gurkhul.\n'I am Glokta. From his Majesty's Inquisition. I have been sent to\ninvestigate this… unfortunate business. I was expecting someone older.'\n'Oh, yes, sorry, I am Malacus Quai,' stammered the young man,\n'apprentice to great Bayaz, the First of the Magi, great in high art and\nlearned in deep—' Kneel, kneel before me! I am the mighty Emperor of\nGurkhul!\n'Malacus…' Glokta cut him off rudely '… Quai. You are from the Old\nEmpire?'\n'Why yes,' the young man brightened slightly at that. 'Do you know my\n—'\n'No. Not at all.' The pale face sagged. 'Were you here last night?'\n'Er, yes, I was asleep, next door. I'm afraid I didn't see anything\nthough…' Glokta stared at him, intent and unblinking, trying to work him\nout. The apprentice coughed and looked at the floor, as if wondering what\nto clean up first. Can this really make the Arch Lector nervous? A miserable\nactor. His whole manner reeks of deception.\n'Someone saw something, though?'\n'Well, erm, Master Ninefingers, I suppose—'\n'Ninefingers?'\n'Yes, our Northern companion.' The young man brightened. 'A warrior\nof great renown, a champion, a prince among his—'\n'You, from the Old Empire. He, a Northman. What a cosmopolitan band\nyou are.'\n'Well yes, ha ha, we do, I suppose—'\n'Where is Ninefingers now?'\n'Still asleep I think, er, I could wake him—'\n'Would you be so kind?' Glokta tapped his cane on the floor. 'It was\nquite a climb, and I would rather not come back later.'\n'No, er, of course… sorry' He hastened over to one of the doors and\nGlokta turned away, pretending to examine the gaping wound in the wall\nwhile grimacing in 'agony and biting his lip to keep from wailing like a sick\nchild.

He seized hold of the broken stones at the edge of the hole with his\nfree hand, squeezing them as hard as he could.\nAs the spasm passed he began to take more interest in the damage. Even\nthis high up the wall was a good four feet thick, solidly built from rubble\nbonded with mortar, faced with cut stone blocks. It would take a rock from\na truly mighty catapult to make such a breach, or a team of strong workmen\ngoing night and day for a week. A giant siege engine or a group of\nlabourers would doubtless have attracted the attention of the guards. So\nhow was it made? Glokta ran his hand over the cracked stones. He had once\nheard rumours that in the far south they made a kind of blasting powder.\nCould a little powder have done this?\nThe door opened and Glokta turned to see a big man ducking under the\nlow lintel, buttoning his shirt with slow, heavy hands. A thoughtful kind of\nslowness. As if he could move quickly but doesn't see the point. His hair was\na tangled mass, his lumpy face badly scarred. The middle finger of his left\nhand was missing. Hence Ninefingers. How very imaginative.\n'Sleeping late?'\nThe Northman nodded. 'Your city is too hot for me—it keeps me up at\nnight and makes me sleepy in the day.'\nGlokta's leg was throbbing, his back was groaning, his neck was stiff as\na dry branch. It was all he could do to keep his agony a secret. He would\nhave given anything to sprawl in that one undamaged chair and scream his\nhead off. But I must stand, and trade words with these charlatans. 'Could\nyou explain to me what happened here?'\nNinefingers shrugged. 'I needed to piss in the night. I saw someone in\nthe room.' He had little trouble with the common tongue, it seemed, even if\nthe content was hardly polite.\n'Did you see who this someone was?'\n'No. It was a woman, I saw that much.' He worked his shoulders, clearly\nuncomfortable.\nA woman, really?' This story becomes more ridiculous by the second.\n'Anything else? Can we narrow our search beyond half the population?'\n'It was cold. Very cold.'\n'Cold?' Of course, why not? On one of the hottest nights of the year.\nGlokta stared into the Northman's eyes for a long time, and he stared\nback. Dark, cool blue eyes, deeply set. Not the eyes of an idiot. He may look\nan ape, but he doesn't talk like one. He thinks before he speaks, then says no\nmore than he has to. This is a dangerous man.\n'What is your business in the city, Master Ninefingers?'\n'I came with Bayaz. If you want to know his business you can ask him.\nHonestly, I don't know.'\n'He pays you then?'\n'No.'\n'You follow him out of loyalty?'\n'Not exactly.'\n'But you are his servant?'\n'No. Not really.' The Northman scratched slowly at his stubbly jaw. 'I\ndon't know what I am.'\nA big, ugly liar is what you are. But how to prove it? Glokta waved his"

'How did your intruder cause so much\ndamage?'\n'Bayaz did that.'\n'He did? How?'\n'Art, he calls it.'\n'Art?'\n'Base magic is wild and dangerous,' intoned the apprentice pompously,\nas though he were saying something of great importance, 'for it comes from\nthe Other Side, and to touch the world below is fraught with peril. The\nMagus tempers magic with knowledge, and thus produces High Art, but like\nthe smith or the—'\n'The Other Side?' snapped Glokta, putting a sharp end to the young\nmoron's stream of drivel. 'The world below? Hell, do you mean? Magic? Do\nyou know any magic, Master Ninefingers?'\n'Me?' The Northman chuckled. 'No.' He thought about it for a moment\nand then added, almost as an afterthought, 'I can speak to the spirits though.'\n'The spirits, is that so?' For pity's sake. 'Perhaps they could tell us who\nthis intruder was?'\n'I'm afraid not.' Ninefingers shook his head sadly, either missing\nGlokta's sarcasm or choosing to ignore it. 'There are none left awake in this\nplace. They are sleeping here. They have been for a long time.'\n'Ah, of course.' Well past spirits' bedtime. I tire of this nonsense. 'You\ncome from Bethod?'\n'You could say that.' It was Glokta who was surprised. He had expected\nat best a sharp intake of breath, a hurried effort at concealment, not a frank\nadmission. Ninefingers did not even blink however. 'I was once his\nchampion.'\n'Champion?'\n'I fought ten duels for him.'\nGlokta groped for words. 'Did you win?'\n'I was lucky.'\n'You realise, of course, that Bethod has invaded the Union?'\n'I do.' Ninefingers sighed. 'I should have killed that bastard long ago, but\nI was young then, and stupid. Now I doubt I'll get another chance, but that's\nthe way of things. You have to be… what's the word for it?'\n'Realistic,' said Quai.\nGlokta frowned. A moment ago, he had teetered on the brink of making\nsense of all this nonsense, but the moment had slipped away and things\nmade less sense than ever. He stared at Ninefingers, but that scarred face\nheld no answers, only more questions. Talking with spirits? Bethod's\nchampion but his enemy? Assaulted by a mysterious woman in the dead of\nnight? And he doesn't even know why he's here? A clever liar tells as much\ntruth as he can, but this one tells so many lies I hardly know where to begin.\n'Ah, we have a guest!' An old man stepped into the room, thickset and\nstocky with a short grey beard, vigorously rubbing his bald head with a\ncloth. So this is Bayaz. He threw himself down in the one intact chair,\nmoving with none of the grace one would expect from an important\nhistorical figure. 'I must apologise. I was taking advantage of the bath. A"

I have been bathing every day since we arrived here at the\nAgriont. I grew so besmirched with the dirt of the road that I have\npositively seized upon the opportunity to be clean again.' The old man\nrubbed his hand over his hairless scalp with a faint hissing sound.\nGlokta mentally compared his features to those of Bayaz' statue in the\nKingsway. There is hardly anything uncanny about the resemblance. Half\nas commanding and a great deal shorter. Given an hour I could find five old\nmen who looked more convincing. If I took a razor to Arch Lector Sult, I\ncould do better. Glokta glanced at his shiny pate. I wonder if he takes a\nrazor to that every morning?\n'And you are?' asked the supposed Bayaz.\n'Inquisitor Glokta.'\n'Ah, one of His Majesty's Inquisitors. We are honoured!'\n'Oh no, the honour is mine. You, after all, are the legendary Bayaz, First\nof the Magi.'\nThe old man glared back at him, his green eyes prickly hard. 'Legendary\nis perhaps a shade too much, but I am Bayaz.'\n'Your companion, Master Ninefingers, was just describing last night's\nevents to me. A colourful tale. He claims that you caused… all this.'\nThe old man snorted. 'I am not in the habit of welcoming uninvited\nguests.'\n'So I see.'\n'Alas, there was some damage to the suite. In my experience one should\nact quickly and decisively. The pieces can always be picked up afterward.'\n'Of course. Forgive my ignorance, Master Bayaz, but how, precisely,\nwas the damage caused?'\nThe old man smiled. 'You can understand that we do not share the\nsecrets of our order with just anyone, and I am afraid that I already have an\napprentice.' He indicated the unconvincing youth.\n'We met. In simple terms then, perhaps, that I might understand?'\n'You would call it magic'\n'Magic. I see.'\n'Indeed. It is, after all, what we Magi are best known for.'\n'Mmm. I don't suppose you would be kind enough to demonstrate, for\nmy benefit?'\n'Oh no!' The so-called wizard gave a comfortable laugh. 'I don't do\ntricks.'\nThis old fool is as hard to fathom as the Northman. The one barely\nspeaks, while the other talks and talks but says nothing. 'I must admit to\nbeing somewhat at a loss as to how this intruder got in.' Glokta glanced\nround the room, examining the possible means of entrance. 'The guard saw\nnothing, which leaves the window.'\nHe shuffled cautiously to the hole and peered out. There had been a\nsmall balcony, but a few stubby splinters of stone were all that remained.\nOtherwise the wall fell smooth and sheer all the way to the glittering water\nfar, far below. 'That's quite a climb to make, especially in a dress. An\nimpossible one, wouldn't you say? How do you think this woman made it?'"

'Do you want me to do your job for you? Perhaps\nshe clambered up the latrine chute!' The Northman looked deeply troubled\nby that suggestion. 'Why don't you catch her and ask her? Isn't that what\nyou're here for?'\nTouchy, touchy, and consummately acted. An air of injured innocence so\nconvincing, he almost has me believing this garbage. Almost, but not quite.\n'Therein lies the problem. There is no sign of your mysterious intruder. No\nbody has been recovered. Some wood, small pieces of furniture, the stones\nfrom the wall, they were scattered widely in the streets below. But nothing\nof any intruder, of either sex.'\nThe old man stared back at him, a hard frown beginning to form on his\nface. 'Perhaps the body burned to nothing. Perhaps it was torn apart, into\npieces too small to see, or boiled away into the air. Magic is not always\nprecise, or predictable, even in the hands of a master. Such things can\nhappen. Easily. Particularly when I become annoyed.'\n'I fear I must risk your annoyance, though. It has occurred to me that\nyou might not, in fact, be Bayaz, the First of the Magi.'\n'Indeed?' The old man's bushy eyebrows drew together.\n'I must at least entertain the possibility…' a tense stillness had settled on\nthe room '… that you are an impostor.'\n'A fraud?' snapped the so-called Magus. The pale young man lowered\nhis head and backed quietly away towards the wall. Glokta felt suddenly\nvery alone in the midst of that rubble strewn circle, alone and increasingly\nunsure of himself, but he soldiered on.\n'It had occurred to me that this whole event might have been staged for\nour benefit. A convenient demonstration of your magical powers.'\n'Convenient?' Hissed the bald old man, his voice unnaturally loud.\n'Convenient, say you? It would be convenient if I was left to enjoy a night's\nsleep uninterrupted. Convenient if I was now sitting in my old chair on the\nClosed Council. Convenient if people took my word as law, the way they\nused to, without asking a lot of damn fool questions!'\nThe resemblance to the statue on the Kingsway was suddenly much\nincreased. There, now, was the frown of command, the sneer of contempt,\nthe threat of terrible anger. The old man's words seemed to press on Glokta\nlike a great weight, driving the breath from his body, threatening to crush\nhim to his knees, cutting into his skull, and leaving behind a creeping shred\nof doubt. He glanced up at the yawning hole in the wall. Powder?\nCatapults? Labourers? Is there not a simpler explanation? The world\nseemed to shift around him, as it had in the Arch Lector's study a few days\nbefore, his mind turned the pieces, pulling them apart, putting them\ntogether.

Nothing more. 'If you are as you say, you\nhave nothing to fear from my questions, or from your answers.'\nThe old man cracked a smile and the strange pressure was suddenly\nreleased. 'Your candour at least, Inquisitor, is quite refreshing. No doubt you\nwill do your utmost to prove your theory. I wish you luck. I, as you say,\nhave nothing to fear. I would only ask that you find some proof of this\ndeception before bothering us again.'\nGlokta bowed stiffly. 'I will try to do so,' he said, and made for the door.\n'There is one more thing!'

Perhaps somewhere with fewer steps. Damn things play hell\nwith my knees these days.' Indeed? There, at least, we can agree.\nGlokta gave the three of them one last inspection. The bald old man\nstared back, his face a blank wall. The lanky youth glanced up anxiously\nthen quickly turned away. The Northman was still frowning towards the\nlatrine door. Charlatans, impostors, spies. But how to prove it? 'Good day,\ngentlemen.'

Then he wiped it on the cloth, closed it and placed it\ncarefully on the table, admiring the way the sunlight glinted on the mother-\nof-pearl handle.\nHe wiped his face, and then—his favourite part of the day—gazed at\nhimself in the looking glass. It was a good one, newly imported from\nVisserine, a present from his father: an oval of bright, smooth glass in a\nframe of lavishly-carved dark wood. A fitting surround for such a handsome\nman as the one gazing happily back at him. Honestly, handsome hardly did\nhim justice.\n'You're quite the beauty aren't you?' Jezal said to himself, smiling as he\nran his fingers over the smooth skin of his jaw. And what a jaw it was. He\nhad often been told it was his best feature, not that there was anything\nwhatever wrong with the rest of him. He turned to the right, then to the left,\nthe better to admire that magnificent chin. Not too heavy, not brutish, but\nnot too light either, not womanly or weak. A man's jaw, no doubt, with a\nslight cleft in the chin, speaking of strength and authority, but sensitive and\nthoughtful too. Had there ever been a jaw like it? Perhaps some king, or\nhero of legend, once had one almost as fine. It was a noble jaw, that much\nwas clear. No commoner could ever have had a chin so grand.\nIt must have come from his mother's side of the family, Jezal supposed."

A steady flood of people would be\nfiling into the Agriont, taking their seats on the great wooden benches in the\nSquare of Marshals. Thousands of them. Everyone who was anyone, and\nplenty more who weren't. They were already gathering: shouting, jostling,\nexcited, waiting for… him. Jezal coughed and tried to push the thought\nfrom his mind. He had kept himself awake with it for half the night already.\nHe moved over to the table, where the breakfast tray was sitting. He\npicked up a sausage absently in his fingertips and took a bite off the end,\nchewing it without relish. He wrinkled his nose and tossed it back in the\ndish. He had no appetite this morning. He was just wiping his fingers on the\ncloth when he noticed something lying on the floor by the door, a slip of\npaper. He bent and picked it up, unfolded it. A single line, written in a neat,\nprecise hand:\nMeet me tonight, at the statue of\nHarod the Great near the Four Corners\n—A.\n'Shit,' he murmured, disbelieving, reading the line over and over. He\nfolded the paper shut, glancing nervously round the room. Jezal could only\nthink of one 'A'. He had pushed her to the back of his mind the last couple\nof days, he had been spending every spare moment training. This brought it\nall back though, and no mistake.\n'Shit!' He opened the paper and read the line again. Meet me tonight?\nHe could not escape a slight flush of satisfaction at that, and it slowly\nbecame a very distinct glow of pleasure. His mouth curled into a gormless\ngrin. Secret meetings in the darkness? His skin prickled with excitement at\nthe prospect. But secrets have a way of coming to the surface, and what if\nher brother found out? That thought brought on a fresh rush of nerves. He\ntook the slip of paper in both hands, ready to tear it in half, but at the last\nmoment he folded it instead, and slipped it into his pocket.\nAs Jezal made his way down the tunnel he could already hear the crowd. A\nstrange, echoing murmur, seeming to come out of the very stones. He had\nheard it before, of course, as a spectator at last year's Contest, but it hadn't\nmade his skin sweat and his guts turn over then.

Jezal felt West's consoling hand\non his shoulder. 'I nearly turned around and ran the first time, but it'll pass\nas soon as the steels are drawn, believe me.'\n'Yes,' mumbled Jezal, 'of course.'

They were in his hand.\nThere was quite a crowd in the hall at the far end: trainers, seconds,\nfriends, family members and hangers-on. You could tell who the contestants\nwere, though; the fifteen young men with steels clutched tightly in their\nhands. The sense of fear was palpable, and contagious. Everywhere Jezal\nlooked he saw pale, nervous faces, sweaty foreheads, anxious eyes darting\naround. It wasn't helped by the noise of the crowd, ominously loud beyond\nthe closed double doors at the far end of the room, swelling and subsiding\nlike a stormy sea.\nThere was only one man there who didn't seem at all bothered by the\noccasion, leaning against the wall on his own with one foot up on the\nplaster and his head tipped back, staring down his nose at the assembly\nthrough barely open eyes. Most of the contestants were lithe, stringy,\nathletic. He was anything but. A big, heavy man with hair shaved to dark\nstubble. He had a great thick neck and a doorstep of a jaw—the jaw of a\ncommoner, Jezal rather thought, but a large and powerful commoner with a\nmean streak. Jezal might have taken him for someone's servant but that he\nhad a pair of steels dangling loosely from one hand.\n'Gorst,' West whispered in Jezal's ear.\n'Huh. Looks more like a labourer than a swordsman to me.'\n'Maybe, but looks can lie.' The sound of the crowd was slowly fading,\nand the nervy chatter within the room subsided along with it. West raised\nhis eyebrows. 'The King's address,' he whispered.\n'My friends! My countrymen! My fellow citizens of the Union!' came a\nringing voice, clearly audible even through the heavy doors.\n'Hoff,' snorted West. 'Even here he takes the King's place. Why doesn't\nhe just put the crown on and have done with it?'"

Why doesn't\nhe just put the crown on and have done with it?'\n'One month ago today,' came the far-off bellow of the Lord\nChamberlain, 'fellows of mine on the Closed Council put forward the\nquestion… should there be a Contest this year?' Boos and shouts of wild\ndisapproval were heard from the crowd. 'A fair question!' cried Hoff, 'for we\nare at war! A deadly struggle in the North! The very liberties which we hold\nso dear, the very freedoms which make us the envy of the world, our very\nway of life, stand threatened by the savage!'\nA clerk began making his way around the room, separating the\ncontestants from their families, their trainers, their friends. 'Good luck,' said\nWest, clapping Jezal on the shoulder, 'I'll see you out there.' Jezal's mouth\nwas dry, and he could only nod.\n'And these were brave men who asked the question!' Boomed out Hoffs\nvoice from beyond the doors. 'Wise men! Patriots all! My stalwart\ncolleagues on the Closed Council! I understood why they might think, there\nshould be no Contest this year!' There was a long pause. 'But I said to them,\nno!'\nAn eruption of manic cheering. 'No! No!' screamed the crowd. Jezal\nwas ushered into line along with the other contestants, two abreast, eight\npairs. He fussed with his steels as the Lord Chamberlain droned on, though\nhe'd checked them twenty times already.\n'No, I said to them! Should we allow these barbarians, these animals of\nthe frozen North, to tread upon our way of life? Should we allow this\nbeacon of freedom amidst the darkness of the world to be extinguished? No,\nI said to them! Our liberty is not for sale at any price! On this, my friends,\nmy countrymen, my fellow citizens of the Union, on this you may\ndepend… we will win this war!'\nAnother great ocean swell of approval. Jezal swallowed, glanced\nnervously around. Bremer dan Gorst was standing there beside him. The big\nbastard had the temerity to wink, grinning as if he hadn't a care in the world.\n'Damn idiot,' whispered Jezal, but he took care that his lips didn't move.\n'And so, my friends, and so,' came Hoff's final cries, 'what finer\noccasion could there be than when we stand upon the very brink of peril?\nTo celebrate the skill, the strength, the prowess, of some of our nation's\nbravest sons! My fellow citizens, my countrymen of the Union, I give you\nyour contestants!'\nThe doors were heaved open and the roar of the crowd beyond rushed\ninto the hall and made the rafters ring: suddenly, deafeningly loud. The\nfront pair of swordsmen began to stride out through the bright archway,\nthen the next pair, then the next. Jezal was sure he would freeze, motionless\nand staring like a rabbit, but when his turn came his feet stepped off\nmanfully next to Gorst's, the heels of his highly polished boots clicking\nacross the tiled floor and through the high doorway."

All around, great banks of\nseating had been erected, stretching back, and back, and up, and up on all\nsides, spilling over with a boiling multitude. The contestants filed down a\ndeep valley between the towering stands towards the centre of this great\narena, the beams, and struts, and tree-trunk supports like a shadowy forest\non either side. Directly before them, seeming very far away, the fencing\ncircle had been laid, a little ring of dry yellow grass in the midst of a sea of\nfaces.\nDown near the front Jezal could make out the features of the rich and\nnoble. Dressed in their best, shading their eyes from the bright sun, on the\nwhole fashionably disinterested in the spectacle before them. Further back,\nhigher up, the figures became less distinct, the clothes less fine. The vast\nmajority of the crowd were mere blobs and specks of colour, crammed in\naround the distant edge of the dizzying bowl, but the commoners made up\nfor their distance with their excitement: cheering, shouting, standing up on\ntheir toes and waving their arms in the air. Above them, the tops of the very\nhighest buildings around the square peered over, walls and roofs sticking up\nlike islands in the ocean, the windows and parapets crammed with\nminuscule onlookers.\nJezal blinked at this great display of humanity. Part of him was aware\nthat his mouth was hanging open, but too small a part to close it. Damn, he\nfelt queasy. He knew he should have eaten something, but it was too late\nnow. What if he puked, right here in front of half the world? He felt that\nsurge of blind panic again. Where did he leave his steels? Where were they?\nIn his hand. In his hand. The crowd roared, and sighed, and wailed, with a\nmyriad of different voices.\nThe contestants began to move away from the circle. Not all of them\nwould be fighting today, most would only watch. As though there was a\nneed for extra spectators. They began to make their way towards the front\nrows, but Jezal was not going with them, more was the pity. He made for\nthe enclosures where the contestants prepared to fight.\nHe flopped down heavily next to West, closed his eyes and wiped his\nsweaty forehead as the crowd cheered on. Everything was too bright, too\nloud, too overpowering. Marshal Varuz was nearby, leaning over the side of\nthe enclosure to shout in someone's ear. Jezal stared across the arena at the\noccupants of the royal box opposite, hoping vainly for a distraction.\n'His Majesty the King seems to be enjoying the proceedings,' whispered\nWest in Jezal's ear.\n'Mmm.' The King, in fact, appeared already to have fallen soundly\nasleep, his crown slipping off at an angle. Jezal wondered idly what would\nhappen if it fell off.\nCrown Prince Ladisla was there, fabulously dressed as always, beaming\naround at the arena with an enormous smile as though everyone was there"

        "text": "happen if it fell off.\nCrown Prince Ladisla was there, fabulously dressed as always, beaming\naround at the arena with an enormous smile as though everyone was there\nfor him. His younger brother, Prince Raynault, could hardly have looked\nmore different: plain and sober, frowning worriedly at his semi-conscious\nfather. Their mother, the Queen, sat beside them, bolt upright with her chin\nin the air, studiously pretending that her august husband was wide awake,\nand that his crown was in no danger of dropping suddenly and painfully\ninto her lap. Between her and Lord Hoff, Jezal's eye was caught by a young\nwoman—very, very beautiful. She was even more expensively dressed than\nLadisla, if that was possible, with a chain of huge diamonds round her neck,\nflashing bright in the sun.\n'Who's the woman?' asked Jezal.\n'Ah, the Princess Terez,' murmured West. 'The daughter of Grand Duke\nOrso, Lord of Talins. She's quite the celebrated beauty, and for once it\nseems that rumour doesn't exaggerate.'\n'I thought nothing good ever came from Talins.'\n'So I've heard, but I think she might be the exception, don't you?' Jezal\nwas not entirely convinced. Spectacular, no doubt, but there was an icy\nproud look to her eye. 'I think the Queen has it in mind that she marry\nPrince Ladisla.' As Jezal watched, the Crown Prince leant across his mother\nto favour the Princess with some witless banter, then exploded into laughter\nat his own joke, slapping his knee with merriment. She gave a frosty little\nsmile, radiating contempt even at this distance. Ladisla seemed not to notice\nthough, and Jezal's attention was soon distracted. A tall man in a red coat\nwas striding ponderously towards the circle. The referee.\n'It's time,' murmured West.\nThe referee held up his arm with a theatrical flourish, two fingers\nextended, and turned slowly around, waiting for the hubbub to subside.\n'Today you will have the pleasure of witnessing two bouts of fencing!' he\nthundered, then thrust up his other hand, three fingers out, as the audience\napplauded. 'Each the best of three touches!' He threw up both arms. 'Four\nmen will fight before you! Two of them will go home… empty handed.' The\nreferee let one arm drop, shook his head sadly, the crowd sighed. 'But two\nwill pass on to the next round!' The crowd bellowed their approval.\n'Ready?' asked Marshal Varuz, leaning forwards over Jezal's shoulder.\nWhat a damn fool question. What if he wasn't ready? What then? Call\nthe whole thing off? Sorry everyone, I'm not ready? See you next year? But\nall Jezal could say was, 'Mmm.'\n'The time has come!' cried the referee, turning slowly around in the\ncentre of the arena, 'for our first bout!'\n'Jacket!' snapped Varuz.\n'Uh.'

A tall, thin young man with long arms and\nweak, slightly dewy eyes. Hardly the most intimidating looking of\nadversaries. Jezal noticed his hands were trembling slightly as he took his\nsteels from his second.\n'Trained by Sepp dan Vissen, and hailing from Rostod, in Starikland…'\nthe referee paused for the greatest effect '…Kurtis dan Broya!' There was a\nwave of enthusiastic clapping. Jezal snorted. These clowns would clap for\nanyone.\nThe tall young man got up from his seat and walked purposefully\ntowards the circle, his steels flashing in the sunlight. 'Broya!' repeated the\nreferee, as the gangly idiot took his mark. West pulled Jezal's steels from\ntheir sheaths. The metallic ringing of the blades made him want to be sick\nagain.\nThe referee pointed once more towards the contestant's enclosure. 'And\nhis opponent today! An officer of the King's Own, and trained by none\nother than Lord Marshal Varuz!' There was scattered applause and the old\nsoldier beamed happily. 'Hailing from Luthar in Midderland but resident\nhere in the Agriont… Captain Jezal dan Luthar!' Another surge of cheering,\nfar louder than Broya had received. There was a flurry of sharp cries above\nthe din. Shouted numbers. Odds being offered. Jezal felt another rush of\nnausea as he got slowly to his feet.\n'Good luck.' West handed Jezal his naked steels, hilts first.\n'He doesn't need luck!' snapped Varuz. 'This Broya's a nobody! Just\nwatch his reach! Press him, Jezal, press him!'\nIt seemed to take forever to reach that ring of short dry grass, the sound\nof the crowd loud in Jezal's ears but the sound of his heart louder still,\nturning the grips of his steels round and round in his sweaty palms. 'Luthar!'\nrepeated the referee, smiling wide as he watched Jezal approach.\nPointless and irrelevant questions flitted in and out of his mind. Was\nArdee watching, in the crowd, wondering whether he would come to meet\nher that night? Would he get killed in the war? How did they get the grass\nfor the fencing circle into the Square of Marshals? He glanced up at Broya.\nWas he feeling the same way? The crowd was quiet now, very quiet. The\nweight of the silence pressed down on Jezal as he took his mark in the\ncircle, pushed his feet into the dry earth. Broya shrugged his shoulders,\nshook his head, raised his steels. Jezal needed to piss. Needed to piss so\nbadly. What if he pissed himself right now? A big dark stain spreading\nacross his trousers. The man who pissed himself at the Contest. He would\nnever live it down, not if he lived a hundred years.\n'Begin!' thundered the referee.\nBut nothing happened. The two men stood there, facing each other,\nsteels at the ready. Jezal's eyebrow itched. He wanted to scratch it, but how?"

He wanted to scratch it, but how?\nHis opponent licked his lips, then took a cautious step to his left. Jezal did\nthe same. They circled each other warily, shoes crunching gently on the dry\ngrass: slowly, slowly drawing closer together. And as they came closer,\nJezal's world contracted to the space between the points of their long steels.\nNow it was only a stride. Now it was a foot. Now just six inches separated\nthem. Jezal's whole mind was focused on those two glittering points. Three\ninches. Broya jabbed forward, weakly, and Jezal flicked it away without\nthinking.\nThe blades rang gently together and, as though that were a signal\nprearranged with every person in the arena, the shouting began again,\nscattered calls to begin with:\n'Kill him, Luthar!'\n'Yes!'\n'Jab! Jab!'\nBut soon dissolving once more into the rumbling, angry sea of the\ncrowd, rising and falling with the movements in the circle.\nThe more Jezal saw of this lanky idiot, the less daunted he became. His\nnerves began to subside. Broya jabbed, clumsy, and Jezal barely had to\nmove. Broya cut, without conviction, and Jezal parried, without effort.\nBroya lunged, positively inept, off-balance and overextended. Jezal stepped\naround it and jabbed his opponent in the ribs with the blunt point of his long\nsteel. It was all so very easy.\n'One for Luthar!' cried the referee, and a surge of cheering ran around\nthe stands. Jezal smiled to himself, basking in the appreciation of the crowd.\nVaruz had been right, this boob was nothing to worry about. One more\ntouch and he'd be through to the next round.\nHe returned to his mark and Broya did the same, rubbing his ribs with\none hand and staring at Jezal balefully from beneath his brows. Jezal was\nnot intimidated. Angry looks are only any use if you can fight worth a\ndamn.\n'Begin!'\nThey closed quickly this time, and exchanged a cut or two.\nJezal could hardly believe how slowly his opponent was moving, it was\nas if his swords weighed a ton each. Broya fished around in the air with his\nlong steel, trying to use his reach to pin Jezal down. He had barely used his\nshort steel yet, let alone coordinated the two. Worse still, he was starting to\nlook out of breath, and they'd barely been fencing two minutes. Had he\ntrained at all, this bumpkin? Or had they simply made up the numbers with\nsome servant off the street? Jezal jumped away, danced around his\nopponent. Broya flapped after him, dogged but incompetent. It was starting\nto become embarrassing. Nobody enjoys a mismatch, and this dunce's\nclumsiness was denying Jezal the opportunity to shine.\n'Oh come on!' he shouted. A surge of laughter flowed around the stands.\nBroya gritted his teeth and came on with everything he had, but it wasn't"

Jezal swatted his feeble efforts aside, dodged around them, flowed\nacross the circle while his witless opponent lumbered after, always three\nsteps behind. There was no precision, no speed, no thought. A few minutes\nbefore, Jezal had been half-terrified by the prospect of fencing with this\ngangling fool. Now he was almost bored.\n'Hah!' he cried, switching suddenly onto the attack, catching his\nopponent off-balance with a savage cut, sending him stumbling back. The\ncrowd came alive, roaring their support. He jabbed and jabbed again. Broya\nblocked desperately, all off-balance, reeled backwards, parried one last time\nthen tripped, his arms flailing, short steel flying out of his hand, and pitched\nout of the circle onto his arse.\nThere was a wave of laughter, and Jezal could not help but join in. The\npoor dolt looked quite amusing, knocked on his back with his legs in the air\nlike some sort of turtle.\n'Captain Luthar wins!' roared the referee, 'two to nothing!' The laughter\nturned to jeering as Broya rolled over. He looked on the verge of tears, the\noaf. Jezal stepped forwards and offered his hand, but found himself unable\nto entirely wipe the smirk off his face. His beaten adversary pointedly\nignored his help, pushing himself up from the ground and giving him a look\nhalf hating, half hurt.\nJezal shrugged pleasantly. 'It's not my fault you're shit.'\n'More?' asked Kaspa, holding out the bottle in a wobbly hand, eyes misted\nover with too much booze.\n'No thanks.' Jezal pushed the bottle gently away before Kaspa had the\nchance to pour. He looked blearily bewildered for a moment, then he turned\nto Jalenhorm.\n'More?'\n'Always.' The big man slid his glass across the rough table top in a way\nthat said, 'I am not drunk', though he clearly was. Kaspa lowered the bottle\ntowards it, squinting at the glass as though it was a great distance away.\nJezal watched the neck of the bottle wobbling in the air, then rattling on the\nedge of the glass. The inevitability of it was almost painful to behold. Wine\nspilled out across the table, splashing into Jalenhorm's lap.\n'You're drunk!' complained the big man, staggering to his feet and\nbrushing at himself with big, drunken hands, knocking his stool over in the\nprocess. A few of the other patrons eyed their table with evident disdain.\n'Alwaysh,' giggled Kaspa.\nWest looked up briefly from his glass. 'You're both drunk.'\n'Not our fault.' Jalenhorm groped for his stool. 'It's him!' He pointed an\nunsteady finger at Jezal.\n'He won!' gurgled Kaspa. 'You won, didn't you, and now we got to\ncelebrate!'\nJezal wished they didn't have to celebrate quite so much. It was\nbecoming embarrassing."

'Think she's quite shmitten with\nyou… shmitten… shmitten.' He worked his wet lips in Jezal's face, trying to\nget his mouth round the word. 'She's ver' rich you know, ver' rich indeed.\nShmitten.'\nJezal wrinkled his nose. He had not the slightest interest in that ghostly\nsimpleton of a cousin, however rich she was, and Kaspa's breath stank.\n'Good… lovely' He disentangled himself from the Lieutenant and shoved\nhim away, none too gently.\n'So, when are we starting on this business in the North?' demanded\nBrint, a little too loud, as though he for one couldn't wait to get underway.\n'Soon I hope, home before winter, eh, Major?'\n'Huh,' snorted West, frowning to himself, 'we'll be lucky to have left\nbefore winter, the rate we're going.'\nBrint looked a little taken aback. 'Well, I'm sure we'll give these savages\na thrashing, whenever we get there.'\n'Give 'em a thrashing!' cried Kaspa.\n'Aye.' Jalenhorm nodded his agreement.\nWest was not in the mood. 'I wouldn't be too sure about that. Have you\nseen the state of some of these levies? They can hardly walk, let alone fight.\nIt's a disgrace.'\nJalenhorm dismissed all this with an angry wave of his hand. 'They're\nnothing but fucking savages, the lot of 'em! We'll knock 'em on their arses,\nlike Jezal did that idiot today, eh, Jezal? Home before winter, everyone says\nso!'\n'Do you know the land up there?' asked West, leaning across the table.\n'Forests, mountains, rivers, on and on. Precious little open space to fight in,\nprecious few roads to march on. You've got to catch a man before the\nthrashing can start. Home before winter? Next winter, maybe, if we come\nback at all.'\nBrint's eyes were wide open and horrified. 'You can't mean that!'\n'No… no, you're right.' West sighed and shook himself. 'I'm sure it'll all\nturn out fine. Glory and promotions all round. Home before winter. I'd take\na coat with you though, just in case.'\nAn uneasy silence descended on the group. West had that hard frown on\nhis face that he got sometimes, the frown that said they'd get no more fun\nout of him tonight. Brint and Jalenhorm looked puzzled and surly. Only\nKaspa maintained his good humour, and he was lolling back in his chair,\neyes half closed, blissfully unaware of his surroundings.\nSome celebration.\nJezal himself felt tired, annoyed, and worried.

The letter was still\nthere, folded up in his pocket. He glanced sidelong at West, then quickly\naway. Damn, he felt guilty. He had never really felt guilty before, and he\ndidn't like it one bit. If he didn't meet her, he would feel guilty for leaving\nher on her own. If he did, he'd feel guilty for breaking his word to West. It\nwas a dilemma alright. Jezal chewed at his thumb-nail. What the hell was it\nabout this damn family?\n'Well,' said West sharply, 'I have to be going. Early start tomorrow.'\n'Mmm,' muttered Brint.\n'Right,' said Jalenhorm.\nWest looked Jezal right in the eye. 'Can I have a word?' His expression\nwas serious, grave, angry even. Jezal's heart lurched. What if West had\nfound out about the letter? What if Ardee had told him? The Major turned\naway, moved over towards a quiet corner. Jezal stared around, desperately\nseeking for some way out.\n'Jezal!' called West.\n'Yes, yes.' He got up with the greatest reluctance and followed his\nfriend, flashing what he hoped was an innocent-seeming smile. Perhaps it\nwas something else. Nothing to do with Ardee. Please let it be something\nelse.\n'I don't want anyone else to know about this…' West looked round to\nmake sure no one was watching. Jezal swallowed. Any moment now he\nwould get a punch in the face. At least one. He had never been punched in\nthe face, not properly. A girl slapped him pretty hard once, but that was\nhardly the same. He prepared himself as best he could, gritting his teeth,\nwincing slightly. 'Burr has set a date. We've got four weeks.'\nJezal stared back. 'What?'\n'Until we embark.'\n'Embark?'\n'For Angland, Jezal!'\n'Oh, yes… Angland, of course! Four weeks you say?'\n'I thought you ought to know, since you're busy with the Contest, so\nyou'd have time to get ready. Keep it to yourself, though.'\n'Yes, of course.' Jezal wiped his sweaty forehead.\n'You alright? You look pale.'\n'I'm fine, fine.' He took a deep breath. 'All this excitement, you know,\nthe fencing and… everything.'\n'Don't worry, you did well today' West clapped him on the shoulder. 'But\nthere's a lot more to do. Three more bouts before you can call yourself a\nchampion, and they'll only get harder. Don't get lazy, Jezal—and don't get\ntoo drunk!' he threw over his shoulder as he made for the door. Jezal\nbreathed a long sigh of relief as he returned to the table where the others\nwere sitting. His nose was still intact.\nBrint had already started to complain, now he could see that West wasn't\ncoming back. 'What the hell was all that?' he asked, frowning and jabbing\nhis thumb at the door.

'It's… well, I mean to say…\nit's cowardly talk is what it is!'\n'Now, look here, Brint,' snapped Jezal, 'he fought in three pitched\nbattles, and he was first through the breach at Ulrioch!

'More wine!' he bellowed at\nno one in particular.\nJezal dropped down on his stool. If the company had been subdued\nbefore West left, it was even more so now. Brint was sulking. Jalenhorm\nwas swaying on his stool. Kaspa had fallen soundly asleep, sprawled out on\nthe wet table top, his breathing making quiet slurping sounds.\nJezal drained his wine glass, and stared round at the unpromising faces.\nDamn, he was bored. It was a fact, he was only now beginning to realise,\nthat the conversation of the drunk is only interesting to the drunk. A few\nglasses of wine can be the difference between finding a man a hilarious\ncompanion or an insufferable moron. He wondered if he himself was as\ntedious drunk as Kaspa, or Jalenhorm, or Brint.\nJezal gave a thin smile as he looked over at the sulking bastard. If he\nwere King, he mused, he would punish poor conversation with death, or at\nleast a lengthy prison term. He stood up from his chair.\nJalenhorm stared up at him. 'What you doing?'\n'Better get some rest,' snapped Jezal, 'need to train tomorrow.' It was the\nmost he could do not to just run out of the place.\n'But you won! Ain't you going to celebrate?'\n'First round. I've still three more men to beat, and they'll all be better\nthan that oaf today.' Jezal took his coat from the back of the chair and pulled\nit over his shoulders.\n'Sult self,' said Jalenhorm, then slurped noisily from his glass.\nKaspa raised his head from the table for a moment, hair on one side\nplastered to his skull with spilled wine.

There\nwas only one place he could think of.\nHe slipped the letter out of his pocket and read it in the dim light from\nthe tavern's windows, just one more time. If he hurried he might still catch\nher. He began to walk slowly towards the Four Corners. Just to talk, that\nwas all. He needed someone to talk to…\nNo. He forced himself to stop. Could he truly pretend that he wanted to\nbe her friend? A friendship between a man and a woman was what you\ncalled it when one had been pursuing the other for a long time, and had\nnever got anywhere. He had no interest in that arrangement.\nWhat then? Marriage? To a girl with no blood and no money?\nUnthinkable! He imagined bringing Ardee home to meet his family. Here is\nmy new wife, father! Wife? And her connections are? He shuddered at the\nthought.\nBut what if they could find something in between, where everyone\nwould be comfortable? His feet began slowly to move. Not friendship, not\nmarriage, but some looser arrangement? He strode down the road towards\nthe Four Corners. They could meet discreetly, and talk, and laugh,\nsomewhere with a bed maybe…\nNo. No. Jezal stopped again and slapped the side of his head in\nfrustration. He couldn't let that happen, even supposing she would. West\nwas one thing, but what if other people found out? It wouldn't hurt his\nreputation any, of course, but hers would be ruined. Ruined. His flesh crept\nat the thought. She didn't deserve that, surely. It wasn't good enough to say\nit was her problem. Not good enough. Just so he could have a little fun? The\nselfishness of it. He was amazed that it had never occurred to him before.\nSo he had reasoned himself into a corner then, just as he had done ten\ntimes already today: nothing good could come from seeing her. They would\nbe away to war soon anyway, and that would put an end to his ridiculous\npining. Home to bed then, and train all day tomorrow. Train and train until\nMarshal Varuz had battered her out of his thoughts. He took a deep breath,\nsquared his shoulders, turned and set off towards the Agriont.\nThe statue of Harod the Great loomed out of the darkness on a marble\nplinth almost as tall as Jezal, seeming far too big and grand for its quiet\nlittle square near the Four Corners. He had been jumping at shadows all the\nway here, avoiding people, doing his best to be inconspicuous. There\nweren't many people around though. It was late, and most likely Ardee\nwould have given up waiting a long time ago, provided she was even there\nto begin with.\nHe crept nervously around the statue, peering into the shadows, feeling\nan absolute fool. He had walked through this square many times before and\nnever given it a second thought. Was it not a public space after all? He had\nas much right as anyone to be here, but somehow he still felt like a thief."

That was a good thing. All for the best. There\nwas nothing to gain, everything to lose, and so forth. So why did he feel so\ncompletely crushed? He stared up at Harod's face, locked into that stony\nfrown that sculptors reserve for the truly great. He had a fine, strong jaw,\ndid Harod, almost the equal of Jezal's own.\n'Wake up!' hissed a voice by his ear. Jezal let vent to a girlish squeal,\nscrambled away, tripped, only stayed upright by clawing at King Harod's\nenormous foot. There was a dark figure behind him, a hooded figure.\nLaughter. 'No need to piss yourself.' Ardee. She pushed back her hood.\nLight from a window slanted across the bottom part of her face, catching\nher lop-sided smile. 'It's only me.'\n'I didn't see you,' he mumbled pointlessly, quickly releasing his\ndesperate grip on the huge stone foot and doing his best to appear at ease.\nHe had to admit it was a poor start. He had no talent for this cloak-and-\ndagger business. Ardee seemed quite comfortable, though. It made him\nwonder whether she hadn't done it all before.\n'You've been pretty hard to see yourself, lately,' she said.\n'Well, er,' he muttered, heart still thumping from the shock, 'I've been\nbusy, what with the Contest and all…'\n'Ah, the all-important Contest. I saw you fight today.'\n'You did?'\n'Very impressive.'\n'Er, thank you, I—'\n'My brother said something, didn't he?'\n'What, about fencing?'\n'No, numbskull. About me.'\nJezal paused, trying to work out the best way to answer that one. 'Well\nhe—'\n'Are you scared of him?'\n'No!' Silence. 'Alright, yes.'\n'But you came anyway. I suppose I should be flattered.' She walked\nslowly around him, looking him up and down, from feet to forehead and\nback again. 'You took your time, though. It's late. I'll have to be getting\nhome soon.'\nThere was something about the way she was looking at him which was\nnot helping to calm his thumping heart. Quite the opposite. He had to tell\nher that he could not see her any more. It was the wrong thing to do. For\nboth of them. Nothing good could come from it… nothing good…\nHe was breathing quick, tense, excited, unable to take his eyes away\nfrom her shadowy face. He had to tell her, now. Wasn't that why he came?\nHe opened his mouth to speak, but the arguments all seemed a long way\naway now, applying at a different time and to different people, intangible\nand weightless.\n'Ardee…' he began.\n'Mmm?' She stepped towards him, head cocked on one side. Jezal tried\nto move away, but the statue was at his back. She came closer still, lips"

She came closer still, lips\nslightly parted, her eyes fixed on his mouth. What was so wrong in it,\nanyway?\nCloser still, her face turned up towards his. He could smell her—his\nhead was full of the scent of her. He could feel her warm breath on his\ncheek. What could be wrong with this?\nHer fingertips were cold against his skin, brushing the side of his face,\ntracing the line of his jaw, curling through his hair and pulling his head\ndown towards her. Her lips touched his cheek, soft and warm, then his chin,\nthen his mouth. They sucked gently at his. She pressed herself up against\nhim, her other hand slipped round his back. Her tongue lapped at his gums,\nat his teeth, at his tongue, and she made little sounds in her throat. So did\nhe, perhaps—he really wasn't sure. His whole body was tingling, hot and\ncold at once, his mind was in his mouth. It was as if he'd never kissed a girl\nbefore. What could be wrong with this? Her teeth nipped at his lips, almost\npainful, but not quite.\nHe opened his eyes: breathless, trembling, weak at the knees. She was\nlooking up at him. He could see her eyes gleaming in the darkness,\nwatching him carefully, studying him.\n'Ardee…'\n'What?'\n'When can I see you again?' His throat was dry, his voice sounded\nhoarse. She looked down at the ground with a little smile. A cruel smile, as\nthough she'd called his bluff and won a pile of money from him. He didn't\ncare. 'When?'\n'Oh, I'll let you know.'\nHe had to kiss her again. Shit on the consequences. Fuck West. Damn it\nall. He bent down towards her, closed his eyes.\n'No, no, no.' She pushed his mouth away from hers. 'You should have\ncome sooner.' She broke away from him and turned around, with the smile\nstill on her lips, and walked slowly away. He watched her, silent, frozen,\nfascinated, his back against the cold stone base of the statue. He had never\nfelt like this before. Not ever.\nShe glanced back, just once, as if to check that he was still watching.\nHis chest constricted, almost painfully, just to see her look at him, then she\nrounded a corner and was gone.\nHe stood there for a moment, his eyes wide open, just breathing. Then a\ncold gust of wind blew through the square and the world pressed back in\nupon him. Fencing, the war, his friend West, his obligations. One kiss, that\nwas all. One kiss, and his resolve had leaked away like piss from a broken\nchamber pot. He stared around, suddenly guilty, confused, and scared. What\nhad he done here?\n'Shit,' he said.\nDark Work\n« ^ »\nA burning thing can make all kind of smells. A live tree, fresh and sappy,\nsmells different ablaze to a dead one, dry and withered.

This burning that the\nDogman smelled now, that was a house. He knew it, sure as sure. A smell\nhe knew better than he'd have liked. Houses don't burn on their own too\noften. Usually there's some violence in it. That meant men around, most\nlikely, and ready for a fight, so he crept right careful down between the\ntrees, slid on his belly to the edge, and peered out through the brush.\nHe saw it now, right enough. Black smoke in a tall pillar, rising up from\na spot down near the river. A small house, still smoking, but burned down to\nthe low stone walls. There'd been a barn too, but nothing more now than a\npile of black sticks and black dirt. A couple of trees and a patch of tilled\nearth. It was a poor enough living at the best of times, farming this far\nnorth. Too cold to grow much—a few roots maybe, and some sheep to herd.\nA pig or two, if you were lucky.\nDogman shook his head. Who'd want to burn out folks as poor as this?\nWho'd want to steal this stubborn patch of land? Some men just like to\nburn, he reckoned. He eased out a touch further, looking right and left down\nthe valley for some sign of the ones as did this, but a few stringy sheep\nspread out across the valley sides was all he could see moving. He wriggled\nback into the brush.\nHis heart sank as he sneaked back towards the camp. Voices raised, and\narguing, as ever. He wondered for a minute whether to just go past and keep\non going, he was that sick of the endless bickering. He decided against it in\nthe end, though. It ain't much of a scout who leaves his people behind.\n'Why don't you shut your hole, Dow?' Tul Duru's rumbling voice. 'You\nwanted south, and when we went south all you did was moan about the\nmountains! Now we're out o' the mountains you grumble on your empty\nbelly all day and all night! I've had my fill of it, you whining dog!'\nNow came Black Dow's nasty growl. 'Why should you get twice as\nmuch to eat, just 'cause you're a great fat pig?'\n'You little bastard! I'll crush you like the worm y'are!'\n'I'll cut your neck while you sleep you great pile o' meat! Then we'll all\nhave plenty to eat! At least we'd all be rid of your fucking snoring! I know\nnow why they named you Thunderhead, you rumbling sow!'\n'Shut your holes the pair of you!' Dogman heard Threetrees roaring,\nloud enough to wake the dead. 'I'm sick of it!'\nHe could see them now, the five of them. Tul Duru and Black Dow,\nbristling up to one another, Threetrees in between them with his hands up,\nForley sat watching, just looking sad, and Grim, not even watching,\nchecking his shafts.\n'Oy!' hissed Dogman, and they all snapped round to look at him.\n'It's the Dogman,' said Grim, barely looking up from his arrows.

There\nwas no understanding that man. He spoke nothing at all for days on end,\nthen when he did speak it was to say what they could all see already.\nForley was keen to distract the lads, as always. It was a hard guess how\nlong they'd keep from killing each other without him around. 'What did you\nfind, Dogman?' he asked.\n'What do you know, I found five stupid fucking bastards out in the\nwoods!' he hissed, stepping out from the trees. 'I could hear them from a\nmile away! And they were Named Men these, would you believe, men who\nshould have known better! Fighting among themselves as always! Five\nstupid bastards—'\nThreetrees raised his hand. 'Alright, Dogman. We should know better.'\nAnd he glowered at Tul and Dow. They glowered at each other, but they\nsaid nothing more. 'What did you find?'\n'There's fighting going on hereabouts, or something like it. I seen a farm\nburning.'\n'Burning, say you?' asked Tul.\n'Aye.'\nThreetrees frowned. 'Take us to it, then.'\nThe Dogman hadn't seen this from up in the trees. Couldn't have. Too\nsmoky and too far to see this. He saw it now though, right up close, and it\nmade him sick. They all saw it.\n'This is some dark work here alright,' said Forley, looking up at the tree.\n'Some dark work.'\n'Aye,' mumbled Dogman. He couldn't think of ought else to say. The\nbranch creaked as the old man swung slowly round, his bare feet dangling\nnear the earth. Might have been he tried to fight, he'd got two arrows\nthrough him. The woman was too young to be his wife. His daughter,\nmaybe. The Dogman guessed the two young ones were her children. 'Who'd\nhang a child?' he muttered.\n'I can think of some black enough,' said Tul.\nDow spat on the grass. 'Meaning me?' he growled, and the two of 'em\nwere off again like hammer on anvil. 'I burned some farms, and a village or\ntwo an all, but there were reasons, that was war. I let the children live.'\n'I heard different,' said Tul. Dogman closed his eyes and sighed.\n'You think I give a dog's arse for what you heard?' Dow barked. 'Might\nbe my name's blacker than I deserve, you giant shit!'\n'I know what you deserve, you bastard!'\n'Enough!' growled Threetrees, frowning up at the tree. 'Have you no\nrespect? The Dogman's right. We're out of the mountains now and there's\ntrouble brewing. There'll be no more of this squabbling. No more. Quiet and\ncold from now on, like the winter-time. We're Named Men with men's work\nto do.'\nDogman nodded, happy to hear some sense at last. 'There's fighting\nnearby,' he said, 'there has to be.'\n'Uh,' said Grim, though it was hard to say exactly what he was agreeing\nwith."

'You're right. We\nneed to put our minds on that now. On that and nothing else. We'll track the\ncrowd as did this and see what they're fighting for. We'll do no good until\nwe know who's fighting who.'\n'Whoever did this fights for Bethod,' said Dow. 'You can tell just by the\nlooking.'\n'We'll see. Tul and Dow, cut these folks down and bury 'em. Maybe that\ntask'll put some steel back in you.' The two of them scowled at each other,\nbut Threetrees paid 'em no mind. 'Dogman, you go and sniff out those as\ndid this. Sniff 'em out, and we'll pay 'em a visit tonight. A visit like they\npaid to these folks here.'\n'Aye,' said Dogman, keen to get on and do it. 'We'll pay 'em a visit.'\nThe Dogman couldn't work it out. If they were in a fight these lot, afraid of\nbeing caught out by an enemy, they weren't making too much of an effort to\ncover their tracks. He followed them simple as could be, five of them he\nreckoned. Must've strolled nice and easy away from the burning farm, down\nthrough the valley beside the river and off into the woods. The tracks were\nso clear he got a little worried time to time, thinking they must be playing\nsome trick on him, watching out there in the trees, waiting to hang him\nfrom a branch. Seemed they weren't though, 'cause he caught up to them\njust before nightfall.\nFirst of all he smelled their meat—mutton roasting. Next he heard their\nvoices—talking, shouting, laughing, making not the meanest attempt to stay\nquiet, easy to hear even with the river bubbling beside. Then he saw them,\nsitting round a great big fire in a clearing, a sheep's carcass skinned on a\nspit above it, taken from those farmers no doubt. The Dogman crouched\ndown in the bushes, nice and still like they should have been. He counted\nfive men, or four and a boy about fourteen years. They were all just sitting,\nno one standing guard, no caution at all. He couldn't work it out.\n'They're just sitting there,' he whispered when he got back to the others.\n'Just sitting. No guard, no nothing.'\n'Just sitting?' asked Forley.\n'Aye. Five of 'em. Sitting and laughing. I don't like it.'\n'I don't like it neither,' said Threetrees, 'but I like what I saw at that farm\nstill less.'\n'Weapons,' hissed Dow. 'Weapons, it has to be.'\nFor once, Tul agreed with him. 'Weapons, chief. Let's give 'em a lesson.'\nNot even Forley spoke up for staying out of a fight this time, but\nThreetrees thought it out for a bit still, taking his moment, not to be hurried.\nThen he nodded. 'Weapons it is.'\nYou won't see Black Dow in the dark, not if he don't want to be seen. You"

You\nwon't hear him neither, but the Dogman knew he was there as he crept\ndown through the trees. You fight with a man for long enough, you get an\nunderstanding. You learn how he thinks and you come to think the same\nway. Dow was there.\nThe Dogman had his task. He could see the outline of the one on the far\nright, his back a black shape against the fire. Dogman didn't spare too much\nthought for the others yet. He spared no thought for anything but his task.\nOnce you choose to go, or your chief chooses for you, you go all the way,\nand never look back 'til the task's done. The time you spend thinking is the\ntime you'll get killed in. Logen taught him that and he'd taken it right to\nheart. That's the way it has to be.\nDogman crept closer, and closer still, feeling the warmth of the fire on\nhis face, feeling the hard metal of the knife in his hand. By the dead he\nneeded to piss, as always. The task wasn't but a stride away now. The boy\nwas facing him—if he'd have looked up fast from his meat he'd have seen\nthe Dogman coming, but he was too busy eating.\n'Gurgh!' shouted one of the others. That meant Dow'd got to him, and\nthat meant he was finished. Dogman leaped forward and stabbed his task in\nthe side of the neck. He reared up for a moment, clutching at his cut throat,\ntook a stumble forward and fell over. One of the others jumped up,\ndropping his half-chewed leg of mutton on the ground, then an arrow stuck\nhim through the chest. Grim, out by the river. He looked surprised a minute,\nthen he sank down on his knees, face twisted up with pain.\nThat left but two, and the boy was still sitting there, staring at the\nDogman, mouth half open with a bit of meat hanging out of it. The last of\nthem was stood up, breathing quick, with a long knife in his hand. He must\nhave had it out for eating with.\n'Drop the blade!' bellowed Threetrees. The Dogman saw the old boy\nnow, striding towards them, the firelight catching the metal rim of his big\nround shield. The man chewed on his lip, eyes flicking from Dogman to\nDow as they moved slowly to either side of him. Now he saw the\nThunderhead, looming out of the darkness in the trees, seeming too big to\nbe a man, his great huge sword glinting over his shoulder. That was enough\nfor him. He threw his knife down in the dirt.\nDow jumped forward, grabbed his wrists and tied them tight behind\nhim, then shoved him down on his knees beside the fire. The Dogman did\nthe same with the boy, his teeth clenched tight, not saying a word. The\nwhole thing was done in an instant, quiet and cold like Threetrees said.\nThere was blood on Dogman's hands, but that was the work and couldn't be\nhelped.

Forley was at the back, peering at the two prisoners.\nDow was staring at the one he'd tied, staring at him hard.\n'I know this one 'ere,' he said, sounding quite pleased about it too. 'Groa\nthe Mire, ain't it? What a chance! You've been gnawing at the back of my\nmind for some time.'\nThe Mire scowled down at the ground. A cruel-looking sort, the\nDogman thought, the type that might hang farmers, if there was one. 'Aye,\nI'm the Mire. No need to ask your names! When they find you've killed\nsome o' the King's collectors you'll be dead men all!'\n'Black Dow, they call me.'\nThe Mire's head came up, his mouth wide open. 'Oh fuck,' he\nwhispered.\nThe boy kneeling next to him stared round with big eyes. 'Black Dow?\nYou what? Not the same Black Dow as… oh fuck.'\nDow nodded slowly, with that nasty smile spreading across his face, that\nkilling smile. 'Groa the Mire. You've all kind of work to pay for. I've had\nyou in my mind, and now you're in my eye.' He patted him on the cheek.\n'And in my hand too. What a happy chance.'\nThe Mire snatched his face away, as far as he could, trussed up like he\nwas. 'I thought you were in hell, Black Dow, you bastard!'\n'So did I, but I was only north o' the mountains. We've questions for\nyou, Mire, before you get what's due. Who's this king? What is it you're\ncollecting for him?'\n'Fuck your questions!'\nThreetrees hit him on the side of his head, hard, where he couldn't see it\ncoming. When he turned round to look, Dow cracked him on the other side.\nBack and forth his head went, till he was soft enough to talk.\n'What's the fight?' asked Threetrees.\n'We ain't fighting!' spat the Mire through his broken teeth. 'You might as\nwell be dead, you bastards! You don't know what's happened, do yer?'\nDogman frowned. He didn't like the sound of this. Sounded like things had\nchanged while they were gone, and he'd never yet seen a change for the\nbetter.\n'I'll do the questions here,' said Threetrees. 'You just keep your tiny\nmind on the answers to 'em. Who's still fighting? Who won't kneel to\nBethod?'\nThe Mire laughed, even tied up like he was. 'There's no one left! The\nfighting's over! Bethod's King now. King of all the North! Everyone kneels\nto him—'\n'Not us,' rumbled Tul Duru, leaning down.

Tul grabbed him round the neck, squeezing with his\ngreat big hand 'til the Mire's eyes were half popping out. 'As you please?\nDoes it please you to hang 'em?'\n'Alright, Thunderhead,' said Dow, peeling Tul's big fingers away, and\npushing him gently back. 'Alright, big lad, this ain't for you, to kill a man\ntied up.' And he patted him on the chest, pulling out his axe. 'It's for work\nlike this you bring along a man like me.'\nThe Mire had more or less got over his throttling now. 'Thunderhead?'\nhe coughed, looking round at them.

'We can't take the baggage and\nwe can't take the risk.'\n'He's just a lad,' said Forley. 'We could let him go.' It was a nice thought,\nbut it wasn't holding much water, and they all knew it. The boy looked\nhopeful, but Tul put an end to that.\n'We can't trust him. Not here. He'd tell someone we were back, and then\nwe'd be hunted. Can't do it. Besides, he had his part in that work at the\nfarm.'\n'But what choice did I 'ave?' asked the boy. 'What choice? I wanted to\ngo south! Go south and fight the Union, and earn myself a name, but they\nsent me here, to get taxes. My chief says do a thing, I got to do it, don't I?'\n'You do,' said Threetrees. 'No one says you could've done different.'\n'I didn't want no part of it! I told him to let the young ones be! You got\nto believe me!'\nForley looked down at his boots. 'We do believe you.'\n'But you're going to fuckin' kill me anyway?'\nDogman chewed at his lip. 'Can't take you with us, can't leave you be.'\n'I didn't want no part of it.' The boy hung his head. 'Don't hardly seem\nfair.'\n'It ain't,' said Threetrees. 'It ain't fair at all. But there it is.'\nDow's axe hacked into the back of the lad's skull and he sprawled out on\nhis face. The Dogman winced and looked away. He knew Dow did it that\nway so they wouldn't have to look at the boy's face. A good idea most\nlikely, and he hoped it helped the others, but face up or face down was all\nthe same to him. He felt almost as sick as he had back at the farm."

He felt almost as sick as he had back at the farm.\nIt wasn't the worst day he'd ever had, not by a long way. But it was a\nbad one.\nThe Dogman watched 'em filing down the road from a good spot up in the\ntrees where no one could see him. He made sure it was downwind from 'em\ntoo, cause being honest, he was smelling a bit ripe. It was a strange old\nprocession. On the one hand they looked like fighting men, off to a weapon-\ntake and then to battle. On the other hand they were all wrong. Old weapons\nmostly, and odds and sods of mixed up armour. Marching, but loose and\nragged. Most of 'em too old to be prime fighters, grey hair and bald heads,\nand a lot of the rest too young for beards, hardly more than boys.\nSeemed to the Dogman like nothing made sense in the North no more.\nHe thought on what the Mire had said before Dow killed him. War with the\nUnion. Were these lot off to war? If they were then Bethod must have been\nscraping the pot.\n'What's to do, Dogman?' asked Forley, as he stepped back into the camp.\n'What's happening down there?'\n'Men. Armed, but none too well. Five score or more. Young and old\nmostly, heading south and west,' and the Dogman pointed off down the\nroad.\nThreetrees nodded. 'Towards Angland. He means it then, Bethod. He's\nmaking war on the Union, all the way. No amount of blood's enough for\nthat one. He's taking every man can hold a spear.' That was no surprise, in\nits way. Bethod had never been one for half measures. He was all or\nnothing, and didn't care who got killed along the road. 'Every man,'\nmuttered Threetrees to himself. 'If the Shanka come over the mountains\nnow…'\nDogman looked round. Frowning, worried, dirty faces. He knew what\nThreetrees was saying, they could all see it. If the Shanka came now, with\nno one left in the North to fight 'em, that business at the farm would be the\nbest of it.\n'We got to warn someone!' shouted Forley, 'we got to warn them!'\nThreetrees shook his head. 'You heard the Mire. Yawl's gone, and\nRattleneck, and Sything. All dead and cold, and gone back to the mud.\nBethod's King now, King of the Northmen.' Black Dow scowled and\ngobbed in the dirt. 'Spit all you like Dow, but facts is facts. There's no one\nleft to warn.'\n'No one but Bethod himself,' muttered the Dogman, miserable at having\nto say it.\n'Then we got to tell him!' Forley looked round them all, desperate. 'He\nmay be a heartless bastard but at least he's a man! He's better than the\nFlatheads ain't he? We got to tell someone!'\n'Hah!' barked Dow. 'Hah! You think he'll listen to us, Weakest? You"

Because\nwe're strong. Named men. Known men. The type of men that others will\nfollow.'\nTul nodded his big head. 'Aye, there'll be no welcome for us at Carleon\nI'm thinking. No welcome without a spike on the end of it.'\n'I'm not strong!' shouted Forley. 'I'm the Weakest, everyone knows that!\nBethod's got no reason to fear me, nor to hate me neither. I'll go!'\nDogman looked at him, surprised. They all did. 'You?' asked Dow.\n'Aye, me! I may be no fighter, but I'm no coward neither! I'll go and talk\nto him. Maybe he'll listen.' Dogman stood and stared. It was so long since\nany one of them had tried to talk their way out of a fix he'd forgotten it\ncould be done.\n'Might be he'll listen,' muttered Threetrees.\n'He might listen,' said Tul. 'Then he might bloody kill you, Weakest!'\nDogman shook his head. 'It's quite a chance.'\n'Maybe, but it's worth the doing, ain't it?'\nThey all looked at each other, worried. It was some bones that Forley\nwas showing, no doubt, but the Dogman didn't much like the sound of this\nfor a plan. He was a thin thread to hang your hopes on, was Bethod. A\nmighty thin thread.\nBut like Threetrees said, there was no one else.\nWords and Dust\n« ^ »\nKurster pranced around the outside of the circle, his long golden hair\nbouncing on his shoulders, waving to the crowd, blowing kisses to the girls.\nThe audience cheered and howled and whooped as the lithe young man\nmade his flashy rounds. He was an Aduan, an officer of the King's Own. A\nlocal boy, and so very popular.\nBremer dan Gorst was leaning against the barrier, watching his\nopponent dance through barely open eyes. His steels were unusually heavy-\nlooking, weighty and worn and well-used, too heavy to be quick perhaps.\nGorst himself looked too heavy to be quick, come to that, a great thick-\nnecked bull of a man, more like a wrestler than a swordsman. He looked the\nunderdog in this bout. The majority of the crowd seemed to think so. But I\nknow better.\nNearby a bet-maker was shouting odds, taking money from the babbling\npeople around him. Nearly all of the bets were for Kurster. Glokta leaned\nacross from his bench. 'What odds are you giving on Gorst now?'\n'On Gorst?' asked the bet-maker, 'evens.'\n'I'll take two hundred marks.'\n'Sorry, friend, I can't cover that.'\n'A hundred then, at five to four.'\nThe bet-maker thought about it for a moment, looking skywards as he"

'Done.'\nGlokta sat back as the referee introduced the contestants, watching\nGorst roll up his shirt-sleeves. The man's forearms were thick as tree trunks,\nheavy cords of muscle squirming as he worked his meaty fingers. He\nstretched his thick neck to one side and the other, then he took his steels\nfrom his second and loosed a couple of practice jabs. Few in the crowd\nnoticed. They were busy cheering Kurster as he took his mark. But Glokta\nsaw. Quicker than he looks. A lot, lot quicker. Those heavy steels no longer\nseem so clumsy.\n'Bremer dan Gorst!' shouted the referee, as the big man trudged to his\nmark. The applause was meagre indeed. This lumbering bull was no one's\nidea of a swordsman.\n'Begin!'\nIt wasn't pretty. From the very start Gorst swung his heavy long steel in\ngreat heedless sweeps, like a champion woodsman chopping logs, giving\nthroaty growls with every blow. It was a strange sight. One man was in a\nfencing contest, the other seemed to think he was fighting to the death. You\nonly have to touch him, man, not split him in half. But as Glokta watched,\nhe realised the mighty cuts were not nearly so clumsy as they seemed. They\nwere well-timed, and highly accurate. Kurster laughed as he danced away\nfrom the first great swing, smiled as he dodged the third, but by the fifth his\nsmile was long gone. And it doesn't look like coming back.\nIt wasn't pretty at all. But the power is undeniable. Kurster ducked\ndesperately under another great arcing cut. That one was hard enough to\ntake his head off, blunted steels or no.\nThe crowd's favourite did his best to seize the initiative, jabbing away\nfor all he was worth, but Gorst was more than equal to it. He grunted as he\nturned the jabs efficiently away with his short steel, then growled again as\nhe brought his long whistling around and over. Glokta winced as it smashed\ninto Kurster's sword with a resounding crash, snapping the man's wrist back\nand nearly tearing the steel from his fingers. He stumbled back from the\nforce of it, grimacing with pain and shock.\nNow I realise why Gorst's steels seem so worn. Kurster dodged around\nthe circle, trying to escape the onslaught, but the big man was too quick.\nFar too quick. Gorst had the measure of him now, anticipating every\nmovement, harrying his opponent with relentless blows. There was no\nescape.\nTwo heavy thrusts drove the hapless officer back towards the edge of\nthe circle, then a scything cut ripped his long steel from his hand and\nembedded it, wobbling wildly back and forth, in the turf. He staggered for a\nmoment, eyes wide, his empty hand trembling, then Gorst was on him,\nletting go a roar and ramming full-tilt into his defenceless ribs with a heavy\nshoulder."

I never saw a swordsman fly before.\nKurster actually turned half a somersault, shrieking like a girl as he tumbled\nthrough the air, crashing to the ground with his limbs flopping and sliding\naway on his face. He finally came to rest in the sand outside the circle, a\ngood three strides from where Gorst had hit him, groaning weakly.\nThe crowd was in shock, so quiet that Glokta's cackling had to be\naudible on the back row. Kurster's trainer rushed from his enclosure and\ngently turned his stricken student over. The young man kicked weakly,\nwhimpered and clutched at his ribs. Gorst watched for a moment,\nemotionless, then shrugged and strolled back to his mark.\nKurster's trainer turned to the referee. 'I am sorry,' he said, 'but my pupil\ncannot continue.'\nGlokta could not help himself. He had to clamp his mouth shut with his\nhands. His whole body was shaking with laughter. Each gurgle caused a\npainful spasm in his neck, but he didn't care. It seemed the majority of the\ncrowd had not found the spectacle quite so amusing. Angry mutterings\nsprang up all around him. The grumbling turned to boos as Kurster was\nhelped from the circle, draped between his trainer and his second, then the\nboos to a chorus of angry shouts.\nGorst swept the audience with his lazy, half-open eyes, then shrugged\nagain and trudged slowly back to his enclosure. Glokta was still sniggering\nas he limped from the arena, his purse a good deal heavier than when he\narrived. He hadn't had that much fun in years.\nThe University stood in a neglected corner of the Agriont, directly in the\nshadow of the House of the Maker, where even the birds seemed old and\ntired. A huge, ramshackle building, coated in half-dead ivy, its design\nplainly from an earlier age. It was said to be one of the oldest buildings in\nthe city. And it looks it.\nThe roofs were sagging in the middle, a couple of them close to outright\ncollapse. The delicate spires were crumbling, threatening to topple off into\nthe unkempt gardens below. The render on the walls was tired and grimy,\nand in places whole sections had fallen away to reveal the bare stones and\ncrumbling mortar beneath. In one spot a great brown stain flared out down\nthe wall from a section of broken guttering. There had been a time when the\nstudy of sciences had attracted some of the foremost men in the Union,\nwhen this building had been among the grandest in the city. And Sult thinks\nthe Inquisition is out of fashion.\nTwo statues flanked the crumbling gate. Two old men, one with a lamp,\none pointing at something in a book. Wisdom and progress or some such\nrubbish. The one with the book had lost his nose some time during the past\ncentury, the other was leaning at an angle, his lamp stuck out despairingly\nas though clutching for support."

They rattled,\nmoved noticeably, as if they might at any moment drop from their hinges.\nGlokta waited. Waited some time.\nThere was a sudden clatter of bolts being drawn back, and one half of\nthe door wobbled open a few inches. An ancient face wedged itself into the\ngap and squinted out at him, lit underneath by a meagre taper clutched in a\nwithered hand. Dewy old eyes peered up and down. 'Yes?'\n'Inquisitor Glokta.'\n'Ah, from the Arch Lector?'\nGlokta frowned, surprised. 'Yes, that's right.' They cannot be half so cut\noff from the world as they appear. He seems to know who I am.\nIt was perilously dark within. Two enormous brass candelabras stood on\neither side of the door, but they were stripped of candles and had long gone\nunpolished, shining dully in the weak light from the porter's little taper.\n'This way, sir,' wheezed the old man, shambling off, bent nearly double.\nEven Glokta had little trouble keeping up with him as he crept away\nthrough the gloom.\nThey shuffled together down a shadowy hallway. The windows on one\nside were ancient, made with tiny panes of glass so dirty that they would\nhave let in little enough light on the sunniest of days. They let in none\nwhatever as the sullen evening came on. The flickering candleflame danced\nover dusty paintings on the opposite wall, pale old men in dark gowns of\nblack and grey, gazing wild-eyed from their flaking frames, flasks and cog-\nwheels and pairs of compasses clutched in their aged hands.\n'Where are we going?' asked Glokta, after they had shambled through\nthe murk for several minutes.\n'The Adepti are at dinner,' wheezed the porter, glancing up at him with\neyes infinitely tired.\nThe University's dining hall was an echoing cavern of a room, lifted one\ndegree above total darkness by a few guttering candles. A small fire\nflickered in an enormous fireplace, casting dancing shadows among the\nrafters. A long table stretched the length of the floor, polished by long years\nof use, flanked by rickety chairs. It could easily have accommodated eighty\nbut there were only five there, crowded up at one end, huddled in around\nthe fireplace. They looked over as the taps of Glokta's cane echoed through\nthe hall, pausing in their meals and peering over with great interest. The\nman at the head of the table got to his feet and hurried over, holding the\nhem of his long black gown up with one hand.\n'A visitor,' wheezed the porter, waving his candle in Glokta's direction.\n'Ah, from the Arch Lector! I am Silber, the University Administrator!'\nAnd he shook Glokta's hand. His companions had meanwhile lurched and\ntottered to their feet as though the guest of honour had just arrived."

He stared round at the eager old men. A good deal\nmore deference than I was expecting, I must say. But then, the Arch Lectors\nname opens all kinds of doors.\n'Glokta, Glokta,' mumbled one of the old men, 'seems that I remember a\nGlokta from somewhere.'\n'You remember everything from somewhere, but you never remember\nwhere,' quipped the administrator, to half-hearted laughter. 'Please let me\nmake the introductions.'\nHe went round the four black-gowned scientists, one by one. 'Saurizin,\nour Adeptus Chemical.' A beefy, unkempt old fellow with burns and stains\ndown the front of his robe and more than one bit of food in his beard.\n'Denka, the Adeptus Metallic' The youngest of the four by a considerable\nmargin, though by no means a young man, had an arrogant twist to his\nmouth. 'Chayle, our Adeptus Mechanical.' Glokta had never seen a man\nwith so big a head but so small a face. His ears, in particular, were\nimmense, and sprouting grey hairs. 'And Kandelau, the Adeptus Physical.' A\nscrawny old bird with a long neck and spectacles perched on his curving\nbeak of a nose. 'Please join us, Inquisitor,' and the administrator indicated\nan empty chair, wedged in between two of the Adepti.\n'A glass of wine then?' wheedled Chayle, a prim smile on his tiny\nmouth, already leaning forward with a decanter and sloshing some into a\nglass.\n'Very well.'\n'We were just discussing the relative merits of our various fields of\nstudy,' murmured Kandelau, peering at Glokta through his flashing\nspectacles.\n'As always,' lamented the Administrator.\n'The human body is, of course, the only area worthy of true scrutiny,'\ncontinued the Adeptus Physical. 'One must appreciate the mysteries within,\nbefore turning one's attention to the world without. We all have a body,\nInquisitor. Means of healing it, and of harming it, are of paramount interest\nto us all. It is the human body that is my area of expertise.'\n'Bodies! Bodies!' whined Chayle, pursing his little lips and pushing food\naround his plate. 'We are trying to eat!'\n'Quite so! You are unsettling the Inquisitor with your ghoulish babble!'\n'Oh, I am not easily unsettled.' Glokta leered across the table, giving the\nAdeptus Metallic a good view of his missing teeth. 'My work for the\nInquisition demands a more than passing knowledge of anatomy.'\nThere was an uncomfortable silence, then Saurizin took hold of the\nmeat plate and offered it out. Glokta looked at the red slices, glistening on\nthe plate. He licked at his empty gums. 'Thank you, no.'\n'Is it true?' asked the Adeptus Chemical, peering over the meat, voice\nhushed. 'Will there be more funds? Now that this business with the Mercers\nis settled, that is?'"

So that's it.\nMoney. But why would they be expecting money from the Arch Lector? The\nheavy meat plate was beginning to wobble. Well… if it gets them listening.\n'Money might be made available, depending, of course, on results.'\nA hushed murmur crept around the table. The Adeptus Chemical\ncarefully set down the plate with a trembling hand. 'I have been having a\ngreat deal of success with acids recently.\n'Hah!' mocked the Adeptus Metallic. 'Results, the Inquisitor asked for,\nresults! My new alloys will be stronger than steel when they are perfected!'\n'Always the alloys!' sighed Chayle, turning his tiny eyes towards the\nceiling. 'No one appreciates the importance of sound mechanical thinking!'\nThe other three Adepti rounded fiercely on him, but the Administrator\njumped in first. 'Gentlemen, please! The Inquisitor is not interested in our\nlittle differences! Everyone will have time to discuss their latest work and\nshow its merits. This is not a competition, is it Inquisitor?' Every eye turned\ntoward Glokta. He looked slowly round at those old, expectant faces, and\nsaid nothing.\n'I have developed a machine for—'\n'My acids—'\n'My alloys—'\n'The mysteries of the human body—'\nGlokta cut them off. 'Actually, it is in the area of… I suppose you would\ncall them explosive substances, that I am currently taking a particular\ninterest—'\nThe Adeptus Chemical jumped from his seat. 'That would be my\nprovince!' he cried, staring in triumph at his colleagues. 'I have samples! I\nhave examples! Please follow me, Inquisitor!' And he tossed his cutlery\nonto his plate and set off towards one of the doors.\nSaurizin's laboratory was precisely as one would have expected, almost\ndown to the last detail. A long room with a barrel-vaulted ceiling, blackened\nin places with circles and streaks of soot. Shelves covered most of the wall-\nspace, brimming with a confusion of boxes, jars, bottles, each filled with its\nown powders, fluids, rods of strange metal. There was no apparent order to\nthe positions of the various containers, and most had no labels.\nOrganisation does not appear to be a priority.\nThe benches in the middle of the room were even more confused,\ncovered in towering constructions of glass and old brown copper: tubes,\nflasks and dishes, lamps—one with a naked flame burning. All gave the\nappearance of being ready at any moment to collapse, dousing anyone\nunfortunate enough to stand nearby with lethal, boiling poisons.\nThe Adeptus Chemical rummaged in amongst this mess like a mole in\nits warren.

He wrinkled his nose. There\nwas a revolting, acrid smell to the place.\n'Here it is!' crowed the Adeptus, brandishing a dusty jar half-full of\nblack granules. He cleared a space on one of the benches, shoving the\nclinking and clanking glass and metal out of the way with a sweep of his\nmeaty forearm. 'This stuff is terribly rare, you know, Inquisitor, terribly\nrare!' He pulled out the stopper and tipped a line of black powder onto the\nwooden bench. 'Few men have been fortunate enough to see this stuff in\naction! Very few! And you are about to become one of them!'\nGlokta took a cautious step back, the size of the ragged hole in the wall\nof the Tower of Chains still fresh in his mind. 'We are safe, I hope, at this\ndistance?'\n'Absolutely,' murmured Saurizin, gingerly holding a burning taper out at\narm's length and touching it to one end of the line of powder. 'There is no\ndanger whatso—'\nThere was a sharp pop and a shower of white sparks. The Adeptus\nChemical leaped back, nearly blundering into Glokta and dropping his\nlighted taper on the floor. There was another pop, louder, more sparks. A\nfoul-smelling smoke began to fill the laboratory. There was a bright flash\nand a loud bang, a weak fizzling, and that was all.\nSaurizin flapped the long sleeve of his gown in front of his face, trying\nto clear the thick smoke that had now thrown the whole chamber into\ngloom. 'Impressive, eh, Inquisitor?' he asked, before dissolving into a fit of\ncoughing.\nNot really. Glokta ground the still-flaming taper out under his boot and\nstepped through the murk towards the bench. He brushed aside a quantity of\ngrey ash with the side of his hand. There was a long, black burn on the\nsurface of the wood, but nothing more. The foul-smelling fumes were\nindeed the most impressive effect, already clawing at the back of Glokta's\nthroat. 'It certainly produces a great deal of smoke,' he croaked.\n'It does,' coughed the Adeptus proudly, 'and reeks to high heaven.'\nGlokta stared at that blackened smear on the bench. 'If one had a large\nenough quantity of this powder, could it be used to, say, knock a hole\nthrough a wall?'\n'Possibly… if one could accumulate a large enough quantity, who\nknows what could be done? As far as I know no one has ever tried.'\n'A wall, say, four feet thick?'\nThe Adeptus frowned. 'Perhaps, but you'd need barrels of the stuff!\nBarrels! There isn't that much in the whole Union, and the cost, even if it\ncould be found, would be colossal! Please understand, Inquisitor, that the\ncomponents must be imported from the distant south of Kanta, and are\nrarities even there.

'You really should see those as well!' He took a\nshuddering breath. 'Tell the Arch Lector… significant progress!' He\ndissolved into another fit of coughing, and Glokta shut the door tightly\nbehind him.\nA waste of my time. Our Bayaz could not have smuggled barrels of\npowder into that room.

'Our library contains a wide range of ancient texts, some of them\ndating back to the period when magic was considered… less remarkable.'\n'Who can assist me?'\nThe Administrator raised his brows. 'I am afraid that the Adeptus\nHistorical is, ah, something of a relic'\n'I need to speak with him, not fence with him.'\n'Of course, Inquisitor, this way.'\nGlokta grabbed the handle of an ancient-looking door, studded with\nblack rivets, began to turn it. He felt Silber seize his arm.\n'No!' he snapped, guiding Glokta away down a corridor beside. 'The\nstacks are down here.'\nThe Adeptus Historical seemed indeed to be a part of ancient history\nhimself. His face was a mask of lined and sagging half-transparent skin.\nSparse hairs, snowy white, stuck unkempt from his head. There were only a\nquarter as many as there should have been, but each was four times longer\nthan you would expect, hence his eyebrows were thin, yet sprouted out to\nimpressive length in all directions, like the whiskers of a cat. His mouth\nhung slack, weak, and toothless, hands were withered gloves, several sizes\ntoo big. Only his eyes showed any trace of life, peering up at Glokta and the\nadministrator as they approached.\n'Visitors, is it?' croaked the old man, apparently talking to a large black\ncrow perched on his desk.\n'This is Inquisitor Glokta!' bellowed the Administrator, leaning down\ntowards the old man's ear.\n'Glokta?'\n'From the Arch Lector!'"

The Adeptus Historical squinted up with his ancient eyes.\n'He's somewhat deaf,' Silber murmured, 'but no one knows these books\nlike he does.' He thought about it for a moment, peering round at the\nendless stacks, disappearing into the gloom. 'No one else knows these\nbooks at all.'\n'Thank you,' said Glokta. The Administrator nodded and strode off\ntowards the stairs. Glokta took a step towards the old man and the crow\nleaped from the table and scrambled into the air, shedding feathers, flapping\nmadly around the ceiling. Glokta hobbled painfully back. I was sure the\ndamn thing was stuffed. He watched it suspiciously until it clattered to a\nhalt on top of one of the shelves and perched there motionless, staring at\nhim with its beady yellow eyes.\nGlokta pulled out a chair and dropped into it. 'I need to know about\nBayaz.'\n'Bayaz,' muttered the ancient Adeptus. 'The first letter in the alphabet of\nthe old tongue, of course.'\n'I didn't know that.'\n'The world's brimming full of what you don't know, young man.' The\nbird gave a sudden harsh caw, horribly loud in the dusty silence of the\nstacks. 'Brimming full.'\n'Then let's begin my education. It's the man Bayaz, I need to know\nabout. The First of the Magi.'\n'Bayaz. The name great Juvens gave to his first apprentice. One letter,\none name. First apprentice, first letter of the alphabet, you understand?'\n'I'm just about keeping up. Did he really exist?'\nThe ancient Adeptus scowled. 'Unquestionably. Did you not have a tutor\nas a young man?'\n'I did, unfortunately.'\n'Did he not teach you history?'\n'He tried, but my mind was on fencing and girls.'\n'Ah. I lost interest in such things a long time ago.'\n'So did I. Let us return to Bayaz.'\nThe old man sighed. 'Long ago, before there was a Union, Midderland\nwas made of many petty kingdoms, often at war with one another, rising\nand falling with the passing years. One of these was ruled by a man called\nHarod, later to become Harod the Great. You've heard of him, I assume?'\n'Of course.'\n'Bayaz came to Harod's throne room, and promised to make him King\nof all Midderland if he did as he was told. Harod, being young and\nheadstrong, did not believe him, but Bayaz broke the long table with his\nArt.'\n'Magic, eh?'\n'So the story goes. Harod was impressed—'\n'Understandable.'\n'—and he agreed to accept the advice of the Magus—'\n'Which was?'\n'To make his capital here, in Adua. To make peace with certain\nneighbours, war with others, and when and how to do it.' The old man"

'Are you telling this story or am I?'\n'You are.' And you're taking your time about it.\n'Bayaz was good as his word. In time Midderland was unified, Harod\nbecame its first High King, the Union was born.'\n'Then what?'\n'Bayaz served as Harod's chief counsellor. Our laws and statutes, the\nvery structure of our government, all are said to be his inventions, little\nchanged since those ancient days. He established the Councils, Closed and\nOpen, he formed the Inquisition. On Harod's death he left the Union,\npromising one day to return.'\n'I see. How much of this is true, do you think?'\n'Hard to say. Magus? Wizard? Magician?' The old man looked at the\nflickering candle flame. 'To a savage, that candle might be magic. It's a fine\nline indeed, between magic and trickery, eh? But this Bayaz was a cunning\nmind in his day, that's a fact.'\nThis is all useless. 'What about before?'\n'Before what?'\n'Before the Union. Before Harod.'\nThe old man shrugged. 'Record-keeping was hardly a priority during the\ndark ages. The whole world was in chaos after the war between Juvens and\nhis brother Kanedias—'\n'Kanedias? The Master Maker?'\n'Aye.'\nKanedias. He stares down from the walls of my little room in the cellars\nbeneath Severard's charming town house. Juvens dead, his eleven\napprentices, the Magi, marching to avenge him. I know this tale.\n'Kanedias,' murmured Glokta, the image of that dark figure with the\nflames behind clear in his mind. 'The Master Maker. Was he real?'\n'Hard to say. He's in the ground between myth and history, I suppose.\nProbably there's some grain of truth in it. Someone must have built that big\nbloody tower, eh?'\n'Tower?'\n'The House of the Maker!' The old man gestured at the room around\nthem. 'And they say he built all this as well.'\n'What, this library?'\nThe old man laughed. 'The whole Agriont, or at least the rock on which\nit stands. The University too. He built it, appointed the first Adepti to help\nhim with his works, whatever they were, to look into the nature of things.\nWe here are the Maker's disciples, yes, though I doubt they know it upstairs.\nHe is gone but the work continues, eh?'\n'After a fashion. Where did he go?'\n'Hah. Dead. Your friend Bayaz killed him.'\nGlokta raised an eyebrow. 'Did he really?'\n'So the story goes. Have you not read The Fall of the Master Maker,'\n'That rubbish? I thought it was all invention.'\n'So it is. Sensational claptrap, but based on writings from the time.'\n'Writings? Such things survive?'\nThe old man narrowed his eyes. 'Some.'\n'Some?

You have them here?'\n'One in particular.'\nGlokta fixed the old man with his eye. 'Bring it to me.'\nThe ancient paper crackled as the Adeptus Historical carefully unrolled the\nscroll and spread it out on the table. The parchment was yellow and\ncrumpled, edges rough with age, scrawled with a dense script: strange\ncharacters, utterly unintelligible to Glokta's eye.\n'What is it written in?'\n'The old tongue. Few can read this now.' The old man pointed to the first\nline. 'An account of the fall of Kanedias, this says, the third of three.'\n'Third of three?'\n'Of three scrolls, I presume.'\n'Where are the other two?'\n'Lost.'\n'Huh.' Glokta peered into the endless darkness of the stacks. It's a\nwonder anything can be found down here. 'What does this one say?'\nThe ancient librarian peered down at the strange writing, poorly\nilluminated by the single flickering candle, his trembling forefinger tracing\nacross the parchment, his lips moving silently. 'Great was their fury.'\n'What?'\n'That's how it begins. Great was their fury.' He began slowly to read.\n'The Magi pursued Kanedias, driving his faithful before them. They broke\nhis fortress, laying ruin to his buildings and killing his servants. The Maker\nhimself, sore wounded in the battle with his brother Juvens, took refuge in\nhis House.' The old man unrolled a little more. 'Twelve days and twelve\nnights, the Magi threw their wrath against the gates, but could not mark\nthem. Then Bayaz found a way inside…' The Adeptus swept his hand over\nthe parchment in frustration. Damp, or something, had blurred the\ncharacters in the next section. 'I can't make this out… something about the\nMakers daughter?'\n'You sure?'\n'No!' snapped the old man. 'There's a whole section missing!'\n'Ignore it then! What's the next thing you can be sure of?'\n'Well, let's see… Bayaz followed him to the roof, and cast him down.'\nThe old man noisily cleared his throat. 'The Maker fell burning, and broke\nupon the bridge below. The Magi searched high and low for the Seed, but\ncould not find it.'\n'Seed?' asked Glokta, baffled.\n'That's all that's written.'\n'What the hell does it mean?'\nThe old man sagged back in his chair, evidently enjoying this rare\nopportunity to hold forth on his area of expertise. 'The end of the age of\nmyth, the beginning of the age of reason. Bayaz, the Magi, they represent\norder. The Maker is a god-like figure: superstition, ignorance, I don't know.\nThere must be some truth to him. After all, someone built that big bloody\ntower,' and he wheezed with breathy laughter.\nGlokta could not be bothered to point out that the Adeptus had made the\nvery same joke a few minutes before.

He looked back at the symbols. 'He broke on\nthe bridge, they searched for the Seed…'\n'Yes, yes.'\n'Patience, Inquisitor.' His withered finger traced across the characters.\n'They sealed up the House of the Maker. They buried the fallen, Kanedias\nand his daughter among them. That's all.' He peered at the page, his finger\nhovering over the last few letters. 'And Bayaz took the key. That's all.'\nGlokta's eyebrows went up. 'What? What was that last bit?'\n'They sealed the gates, they buried the fallen, and Bayaz took the key.'\n'The key? The key to the House of the Maker?'\nThe Adeptus Historical squinted back at the page. 'That's what it says.'\nThere is no key. That tower has stood sealed for centuries, everyone\nknows it. Our impostor will have no key, that's sure. Slowly, Glokta began\nto smile. It is thin, it is very thin, but with the right setting, the right\nemphasis, it might be enough. The Arch Lector will be pleased.\n'I'll be taking this.' Glokta pulled the ancient scroll over and started to\nroll it up.\n'What?' The eyes of the Adeptus were wide with horror. 'You can't!' He\nstaggered up from his chair, even more painfully than Glokta might have\ndone. His crow scrambled up with him, flapping around near the ceiling and\ncroaking in a fury, but Glokta ignored them both. 'You can't take it! It's\nirreplaceable,' wheezed the old man, making a hopeless grab for the scroll.\nGlokta spread his arms out wide. 'Stop me! Why don't you? I'd like to\nsee it! Can you imagine?

'No one cares about the past any more,' he\nwhispered. 'They don't see that you can't have a future without a past.'\nHow very deep. Glokta slipped the rolled-up parchment into his coat\nand turned to leave.\n'Who's going to look after the past, when I'm gone?'\n'Who cares?' asked Glokta as he stalked towards the steps, 'as long as it\nisn't me.'\nThe Remarkable Talents of Brother\nLongfoot\n« ^ »\nThe cheering had woken Logen every morning for a week.

He'd thought it\nwas a battle when he first heard it, but now he knew it was just their damn\nstupid sport. Closing the window brought some relief from the noise, but\nthe heat soon became unbearable. It was sleep a little, or sleep not at all. So\nhe left the window open.\nLogen rubbed his eyes, cursing, and hauled himself from his bed.\nAnother hot, tedious day in the City of White Towers. On the road, in the\nwild, he'd be alert as soon as his eyes opened, but here things were\ndifferent. The boredom and the heat were making him slow and lazy. He\nstumbled across the threshold into the living room, yawning wide and\nrubbing at his jaw with one hand. He stopped.\nThere was someone in there, a stranger. Standing at the window, bathed\nin sunlight with his hands clasped behind him. A small, slight man, with\nhair shaved close to his knobbly skull and strange, travel-worn clothes—\nfaded, baggy cloth wrapped round and round his body.\nBefore Logen had a chance to speak, the man turned and sprang nimbly\nover to him. 'And you are?' he demanded. His smiling face was deeply\ntanned and weather-beaten, like the creased leather on a favourite pair of\nboots. It made it impossible to guess his age. He could have been anywhere\nfrom twenty-five to fifty.\n'Ninefingers,' muttered Logen, taking a cautious step back towards the\nwall.\n'Ninefingers, yes.' The little man pressed forwards and seized Logen's\nhand in both of his, gripping it tightly. 'It is an honour and privilege most\nprofound,' he said, closing his eyes and bowing his head, 'to make your\nacquaintance!'\n'You've heard of me?'\n'Alas, no, but all God's creatures are worthy of the deepest respect.' He\nbowed his head again. 'I am Brother Longfoot, a traveller of the illustrious\norder of Navigators. There are few lands beneath the sun upon which my\nfeet have not trodden.' He pointed down towards his well-worn boots then\nspread his arms wide. 'From the mountains of Thond to the deserts of\nShamir, from the plains of the Old Empire to the silver waters of the\nThousand Isles, all the world is my home! Truly!'\nHe spoke the northern tongue well, better than Logen himself perhaps.\n'And the North too?'\n'One brief visit, in my youth. I found the climate somewhat harsh.'\n'You speak the language well enough.'\n'There are few tongues that I, Brother Longfoot, cannot speak. An\neffortless skill with languages is but one among my many remarkable\ntalents.' The man beamed. 'God has truly blessed me,' he added.\nLogen wondered if this might be some elaborate joke. 'What brings you\nhere?'\n'I have been sent for!' His dark eyes sparkled.\n'Sent for?'\n'Indeed I have! By Bayaz, the First of the Magi! I have been sent for,\nand I have come! That is my way!

The small man stepped away and started to stride around the\nroom at a terrific pace, rubbing his hands together. 'The challenge of this\nassignment spoke as much to the pride of the order, as to its well-\ndocumented greed! And it was I! I who was selected, from all the\nNavigators within the Circle of the World, for this task! I, Brother\nLongfoot! I, and no other! Who in my position, of my reputation, could\nresist such a challenge?'\nHe stopped before Logen and looked up at him expectantly, as if\nwaiting for an answer to his question. 'Er—'\n'Not I!' shouted Longfoot, setting off on another circuit of the room. 'I\ndid not resist it! Why would I? That would not be my way! To journey to\nthe very edge of the World? What a tale that will make! What an inspiration\nto others! What an—'\n'The edge of the World?' asked Logen suspiciously.\n'I know!' The strange man clapped him on the arm. 'We are equally\nexcited!'\n'This must be our Navigator.' Bayaz emerged from his room.\n'I am indeed. Brother Longfoot, at your service. And you are, I presume,\nnone other than my illustrious employer, Bayaz, the First of the Magi.'\n'I am he.'\n'It is an honour and a privilege most profound!' cried Longfoot,\nspringing forward and seizing the Magus by the hand, 'to make your\nacquaintance!'\n'Likewise. I trust your journey was a pleasant one.'\n'Journeys are always pleasant to me! Always! It is the time between\nthem that I find trying. Indeed it is!' Bayaz frowned over at Logen but he\ncould only shrug his shoulders. 'May I ask how long it will be until we\nbegin our journey? I am most keen to embark!'\n'Soon, I hope, the last member of our expedition will arrive. We will\nneed to charter a ship.'\n'Of course! It shall be my particular pleasure to do so! What shall I tell\nthe captain of our course?'\n'West across the Circle Sea, to Stariksa, then on to Calcis in the Old\nEmpire.' The little man smiled and bowed low. 'You approve?'\n'I do, but ships rarely pass to Calcis now. The Old Empire's endless wars\nhave made the waters dangerous thereabouts. Piracy, alas, is rife. It may be\ndifficult to find a captain willing.'\n'This should help.' Bayaz tossed his ever-bulging purse onto the table.\n'It should indeed.'\n'Make sure the ship is fast. Once we are ready I do not wish to waste a\nday.'\n'On that you may depend,' said the Navigator, scooping up the heavy\nbag of coins. 'To sail in slow vessels is not my way! No!

He grabbed Logen\nby the elbow and began to pull him towards the door.\n'I will expect some change, Brother Longfoot!' called Bayaz, from\nbehind.\nThe Navigator turned in the doorway. 'There will be change, on that you\nmay depend. An eye for value, a flair for barter, a dauntless purpose in\nnegotiation! These are but three,' and he smiled broadly, 'of my remarkable\ntalents!'\n'It is a fabulous place, this Adua. Truly. Few cities are its equal. Shaffa,\nperhaps, is larger, but so very dusty. None could deny that Westport and\nDagoska have their sights. Some think of Ospria, on its mountain slopes, as\nthe most beautiful city of the world, but Brother Longfoot's heart, it must be\nsaid, belongs to great Talins. Have you been there, Master Ninefingers,\nhave you seen that noble settlement?'\n'Er…' Logen was busy trying to keep up with the little man, dodging\nbetween the endless flow of people.\nLongfoot stopped so suddenly that Logen almost piled into him. The\nNavigator turned, his hands raised, a faraway look in his eye. 'Talins at\nsunset, seen from the ocean! I have witnessed many remarkable things,\nbelieve me, but I declare that to be the most beautiful sight in all the world.\nThe way the sun gleams on the myriad canals, on the glinting domes of the\nGrand Duke's citadel, on the graceful palaces of the merchant princes!\nWhere now does the shining sea end, and the shining city begin? Ah!\nTalins!' He turned and charged off once more and Logen hurried after him.\n'But this Adua is a fine place, certainly, and growing every year. Things\nhave changed a great deal here since my last visit, indeed they have. Once\nthere were only noblemen and commoners. The noblemen owned the land\nso they had the money and therefore the power. Ha. Simple, you see?'\n'Well—' Logen was having trouble seeing much further than Longfoot's\nback.\n'But now they have trade, and so much of it. Merchants, and bankers,\nand so forth. Everywhere. Armies of them. Now commoners can be rich,\nyou see? And a rich commoner has power. Is he a commoner now, or a\nnobleman? Or is he something else? Ha. Very complicated all of a sudden,\nno?'\n'Er—'\n'So much wealth. So much money. But so much poverty too, eh? So\nmany beggars, so many poor.

Crowded? Do you call this crowded? You should see the great\ntemple in Shaffa at morning prayer! Or the grand square before the\nEmperor's palace when new slaves are up for auction! And hot?

He ducked through the passing crowds towards a narrow sidestreet.\n'This way is the quickest!'\nLogen caught him by the arm. 'Down there?' He peered into the gloom.\n'You sure?'\n'Can you doubt it?' demanded Longfoot, suddenly horrified. 'Can it be\nthat you could doubt it? Among all my remarkable talents, it is my skill at\nnavigation that is paramount! It is for that talent, above all, that the First of\nthe Magi has made so generous a contribution to the coffers of the order!\nCould it be that you… but wait.' He held up his hand and began to smile\nagain, then tapped Logen on the chest with his forefinger. 'You do not know\nBrother Longfoot. Not yet. You are watchful and cautious, I see it, fine\nqualities in their place. I cannot expect you to have my unshakeable faith in\nmy abilities. No! That would not be fair. Unfairness is not an admirable\nquality. No! Unfairness is not my way.'\n'I meant—'\n'I shall convince you!' shouted Longfoot. 'Indeed I shall! You will come\nto trust my word before your own! Yes! This way is the quickest!' And he\nstrode off down the dingy alleyway with remarkable speed, Logen\nstruggling to keep up though his legs were a good half-foot longer.\n'Ah, the back streets!' called the Navigator over his shoulder as they\npassed down dark and grimy lanes, the buildings crowding in ever closer.\n'The back streets, eh?' The alleys grew narrower, darker, and dirtier still.\nThe little man turned to the left and the right, never pausing for an instant to\nconsider his course. 'Do you smell that? Do you smell that, Master\nNinefingers? It smells like…' he rubbed his thumbs and fingertips together\nas he strode along, searching for the words '… mystery! Adventure!'\nIt smelled like shit to Logen. A man lay on his face in the gutter, dead\ndrunk perhaps, or maybe simply dead. Other men passed by, limping and\nhaggard, or standing in threatening groups in doorways, handing round\nbottles. There were women here too.\n'Four marks and I'll give you a blessing, Northman!' one of them called\nto Logen as they passed. 'A blessing you won't soon forget!

Skilled and beautiful all sounded\ntoo complicated to him. One girl caught his eye as they passed, leaning\nagainst a door-frame with one arm up. Watching them pass with a half-\nhearted smile. Logen found her pretty, in a desperate sort of a way. Prettier\nthan he was anyway, and it had been a long time. You have to be realistic\nabout these things.\nLogen stopped in the street. 'Bayaz wanted change?' he muttered.\n'He did. He was most specific on the subject.'\n'There's money to spare, then?'\nLongfoot raised one eyebrow. 'Well, perhaps, let me see…'\nHe pulled out the purse with a flourish and opened it, rooting around\ninside. There was a loud jingling of coins.\n'You think that's a good idea?' Logen glanced nervously up and down\nthe street. Several faces had turned towards them.\n'What's that?' asked the Navigator, still poking around in the purse. He\npulled some coins out, holding them up to the light and peering at them,\nthen pressed them into Logen's palm.\n'Subtlety isn't one of your talents, is it?' Some of the shabby men in the\nalley began to move slowly, curiously towards them, two from in front, one\nfrom behind.\n'No indeed!' laughed Longfoot. 'No indeed!

Logen\nsmashed him in the mouth with his elbow again, tearing the blade from his\nlimp fingers as he dropped into the street, head smacking against the dirty\ncobbles. He whipped round, half expecting to get stabbed in the back, but\nthe other two hadn't moved too quick. They had knives of their own out,\nand one had taken a half-step towards him, but he paused when he saw that\nLogen had the blade up, ready to fight.\nIt was a meagre kind of a weapon, six inches of rusty iron without even\na cross-piece, but it was better than nothing. A lot better. Logen waved it\naround in the air in front of him, just to make sure that everyone could see\nit. Felt good. His odds were much improved.\n'Right then,' said Logen, 'who's next?'\nThe other two moved apart, trying to get to either side of him, weighing\ntheir knives in their hands, but they didn't seem in any great rush to come\non.\n'We can take him!' whispered the squinter, but his friend didn't look too\nsure.\n'Or, you can have this.' Logen opened up his clenched fist, showing the\ncoins that Longfoot had given him. 'And leave us be. This much I can\nspare.' He swished the knife around a bit more, just to add some weight to\nhis words. 'This is what you're worth to me—this much, no more. What's it\nto be?'\nThe one with the squint spat on the ground. 'We can take him!' he hissed\nagain. 'You go first!'\n'You fucking go!' shouted the other.\n'Just take what I'm offering,' said Logen, 'then we none of us have to go.'\nThe one that he'd elbowed groaned and rolled over in the road, and the\nreminder of his fate seemed to decide them. 'Alright, you fucking northern\nbastard, alright, we'll take it!'\nLogen grinned. He thought about throwing the coins at the one with the\nsquint then stabbing him while he was distracted. That's what he'd have\ndone in his youth, but he decided against. Why bother? Instead he opened\nhis fingers and tossed the money into the road behind him, moving towards\nthe nearest wall. He and the two thieves circled each other cautiously, each\nstep taking them closer to the coins and him closer to escape. Soon they'd\nswapped places, and Logen backed away down the street, still holding the\nknife in front of him. When they were ten paces apart the two men squatted"

When they were ten paces apart the two men squatted\ndown and began to pick the scattered coins up from the ground.\n'I'm still alive,' Logen whispered to himself as he quickened his pace.\nThat had been lucky, he knew. It's a fool who thinks that any fight is too\nsmall to be the death of him, however tough he is. Lucky that he caught the\none behind just right. Lucky that the other two had been slow. But then he'd\nalways been lucky with fights. Lucky at getting out of them alive. Not so\nlucky with the getting into them. Still, he felt good about this day's work.\nGlad he hadn't killed anybody.\nLogen felt a hand clap him on the back, and he span round, knife at the\nready.\n'Only me!' Brother Longfoot held up his hands. Logen had nearly\nforgotten the Navigator was there. He must have stayed behind him the\nwhole time, perfectly silent. 'Well handled Master Ninefingers, well\nhandled! Truly! I see that you are not without some talents of your own! I\nam looking forward to travelling with you, I am indeed! The docks are this\nway!' he shouted, already moving off.\nLogen took one last look back at the two men, but they were still\ngrubbing around on the ground, so he threw the knife away and hurried to\ncatch up to Longfoot. 'Do you Navigators never fight?'\n'Some among us do, oh yes, with empty hands and weapons of all kinds.\nMost deadly, some of them, but not I. No. That is not my way.'\n'Never?'\n'Never. My skills lie elsewhere.'\n'I would have thought your travels would bring you across many\ndangers.'\n'They do,' said Longfoot brightly, 'they do indeed. That is when my\nremarkable talent for hiding is at its most useful.'\nHer Kind Fight Everything\n« ^ »\nNight. Cold. The salt wind was keen on the hilltop, and Ferro's clothes were\nthin and ragged. She hugged her arms and hunched up her shoulders,\nstaring sourly down towards the sea. Dagoska was a cloud of pin-prick\nlights in the distance, huddled around the steep rock between the great,\ncurving bay and the glistening ocean. Her eyes could make out the vague,\ntiny shapes of walls and towers, black against the dark sky, and the thin\nneck of dry earth that joined the city to the land. An island, almost. Between\nthem and Dagoska there were fires. Camps around the roads. Many camps.\n'Dagoska,' whispered Yulwei, perched on a rock beside her. 'A little\nsplinter of the Union, stuck into Gurkhul like a thorn. A thorn in the\nEmperor's pride.'\n'Huh,' grunted Ferro, hunching her shoulders still further.\n'The city is watched. Many soldiers. More than ever. It might be\ndifficult to deceive so many'\n'Perhaps we should go back,' she muttered hopefully.\nThe old man ignored her. 'They are here as well. More than one.'\n'Eaters?'\n'I must go closer. Find a way in. Wait here for me.' He paused, waiting"

'You will wait?'\n'Alright!' she hissed, 'alright, I'll wait!'\nYulwei slipped off his rock and away down the slope, padding across\nthe soft earth, almost invisible in the inky blackness. When the sound of his\njingling bangles had faded into the night, she turned away from the city,\ntook a deep breath, and scurried down the slope southwards, back into\nGurkhul.\nNow Ferro could run. Fast as the wind, hours at a stretch. She'd spent a\nlot of time running. When she made it to the base of the hill she ran, feet\nflying across the open ground, breath coming quick and fierce. She heard\nwater beyond, slid down a bank and splashed into the shallows of a slow\nmoving river. She floundered on, knee-deep in the cold water.\nLet the old bastard track me through this, she thought.\nAfter a while she made a bundle of her weapons and held them above\nher head as she swam across, forcing against the current with one arm. She\nflapped out on the other side and ran on along the bank, wiping the water\nfrom her dripping face.\nTime passed slowly and light began to creep into the sky. Morning was\ncoming. The river babbled beside her, her sandals beating out a rapid\nrhythm in the stubbly grass. She left the river behind, running on across the\nflat landscape, turning now from black to grey. A clump of scrubby trees\nloomed up.\nShe crashed between the trunks and slithered down into the bushes, her\nbreath rasping. She shivered in the half-light, heart pounding in her chest. It\nwas silent beyond the trees. Good. She reached inside her clothes and\npulled out some bread and a strip of meat, soggy from the swim but still\nedible. She smiled. She had been keeping half of everything that Yulwei\ngave her for the last few days.\n'Stupid old bastard,' she chuckled to herself between choking mouthfuls,\n'thought he could get the better of Ferro Maljinn, did he?'\nDamn she was thirsty. No help for that now, she could find water later.\nShe was tired though, very tired. Even Ferro got tired. She would rest here\nfor a moment, just a moment. Get the strength back in the legs, then on, on\nto… she twitched, annoyed. She could think about the where later.\nWherever was best for vengeance. Yes.\nShe crawled through the bushes, sat back against one of the trees. Her\neyes closed slowly, by themselves. Just rest for a moment now. Vengeance\nlater.\n'Stupid old bastard,' she muttered. Her head dropped sideways.\n'Brother!'\nFerro woke with a start, head knocking against the tree. It was light, too\nlight. Another bright, hot day. How long had she been sleeping? 'Brother!' A\nwoman's voice, not far off. 'Where are you?'\n'Over here!' Ferro froze, every muscle tensing. A man's voice, deep and"

She heard horse's hooves, moving slowly, several horses,\nand near.\n'What are you doing, brother?'\n'She's close!' shouted the man again. Ferro's throat tightened. 'I can\nsmell her!' Ferro felt in the bushes for her weapons, shoved the sword and\nthe knife through her belt, tucked the other knife up her one, torn sleeve. 'I\ncan taste her, sister! She's very close!'\n'But where?' The woman's voice drew nearer. 'Do you think she can hear\nus?'\n'Perhaps she can!' laughed the man. 'Are you there, Maljinn?' She threw\nher quiver over her shoulder and snatched up her bow. 'We are waiting…'\nhe sang, getting closer still, just beyond the trees now. 'Come out, Maljinn,\ncome out and greet us…'\nShe bolted away, crashing through the bushes, sprinting across the open\nground with desperate speed.\n'There she is!' cried the woman from behind. 'Look at her go!'\n'Get her, then!' shouted the man.\nThe scrubby grassland stretched away unbroken before her. Nowhere to\nrun to. She span around with a snarl, nocking an arrow to her bow. Four\nhorsemen were spurring towards her, Gurkish soldiers, sun glinting on their\ntall helmets and the cruel heads of their spears. Behind them, further back,\nwere two other riders: a man and a woman. 'Stop! In the name of the\nEmperor!' one of the horsemen shouted.\n'Fuck your Emperor!' Her arrow caught the first of the soldiers through\nhis neck and he tumbled backwards from the saddle with a shocked gurgle,\nhis spear flying out of his hand.\n'Good shot!' cried the woman. The second rider took an arrow in his\nchest. His breastplate slowed it, but it still went deep enough to kill. He\nscreamed, dropping his sword in the grass, clutching at the shaft, rolling in\nthe saddle.\nThe third never even made a sound. He got one in the mouth, at no more\nthan ten strides away. The point went right through his skull and knocked\nhis helmet off, but by then the fourth was on her. She threw the bow to the\nground and rolled away as the soldier thrust at her with his spear, then she\npulled the sword from her belt, spitting on the grass.\n'Alive!' shouted the woman, nudging her horse lazily forwards. 'We\nneed her alive!'\nThe soldier turned his snorting mount and urged it cautiously towards\nFerro. He was a big man, with a thick growth of dark stubble on his jaw. 'I\nhope you've made your peace with God, girl,' he said.\n'Fuck your God!' She scuttled out of the way, dodging, moving, staying\nclose to the ground. The soldier jabbed at her with his spear, keeping her at\na distance, his horse's hooves pawing at the ground, kicking dust in Ferro's\nface.\n'Poke her!' she heard the woman shouting behind her."

'But not too hard!\nWe want her alive!' The soldier snarled as he spurred his horse forward.\nFerro ducked and scrambled in front of its kicking legs. The spear point\njabbed, cutting a gash in her arm. She swung the sword with all her\nstrength.\nThe curved blade found the gap between the plates of the soldier's\narmour, took his leg off just below the knee and opened a huge wound in\nthe horse's side. Man and beast screamed together, fell together to the\nground. Dark blood bubbled out across the dirt.\n'She got him!' The woman sounded mildly disappointed.\n'Up, man!' laughed her brother, 'up and at her! There's still a chance!'\nThe soldier thrashed on the ground. Ferro's sword hacked into his face,\nputting a sharp end to his screams. Nearby the second rider was still in his\nsaddle, face twisted, gasping his last breaths, hand clutched around the\nbloody shaft of her arrow. His horse put its head down and started nibbling\nat the dry grass by its hooves.\n'That's all of them,' said the woman.\n'I know.' Her brother sighed deep. 'Must one do everything oneself?'\nFerro glanced up at them as she pushed the bloody sword back through\nher belt. They were sitting carelessly on their horses not far off, the sun\nbright behind them, smiles on their cruel, handsome faces. They were\ndressed like lords, silk flapping round them in the breeze, heavy with\njewellery, but neither one was armed. Ferro scrambled for her bow.\n'Be careful, brother,' said the woman, examining her fingernails. 'She\nfights well.'\n'Like a devil! But she is no match for me, sister, have no fear.' He sprang\ndown from his saddle. 'So then, Maljinn, shall we…'\nThe arrow stuck him through the chest, deep through, with a hollow\nthud.\n'… begin?' The shaft quivered, its point glittering behind him, dry and\nbloodless. He began to walk towards her. Her next arrow caught him\nthrough the shoulder, but he only came on faster, breaking into a run,\nbounding forward with enormous strides. She dropped the bow, fingers\nfumbling for the grip of her sword. Too slow. His outstretched arm caught\nher across the chest with terrible force, slamming her into the earth.\n'Oh, well done, brother!' The woman clapped her hands with delight.\n'Well done!'\nFerro rolled coughing in the dust. She saw the man watching her as she\nstruggled to her feet, the sword clutched in both hands. She swung it at him,\na great overhead arc. It bit deep into the earth. Somehow he had already\ndanced aside. A foot came out of nowhere and sank into her stomach.

She rolled groggily to her knees, the\nworld turning over around her. There was blood on her face. She blinked\nand shook her head, trying to stop the world from spinning. The man was\nmoving towards her, tipping, blurry. He jerked her arrow out of his chest\nand tossed it away. There was no blood, just a little dust. Just dust, curling\nin the air.\nAn Eater. He had to be.\nFerro stumbled up, pulling the knife from her belt. She thrust at him,\nmissed, thrust again, missed again. Her head was swimming. She screamed,\nslashing at him with all her might.\nHe caught her wrist in his hand. Their faces were less than a foot apart.\nHis skin was perfect, smooth, like dark glass. He looked young, almost like\na child, but his eyes were old. Hard eyes. He watched her—curious,\namused, like a boy who found an interesting beetle. 'She doesn't give up,\ndoes she, sister?'\n'Very fierce! The Prophet will be delighted with her!'\nThe man sniffed at Ferro and wrinkled his nose. 'Ugh. She'd better be\nwashed first.'\nShe butted him in the face. His head snapped back but he only giggled.\nHe caught her round the throat with his free hand, shoved her out to arm's\nlength. She clawed at his face but his arm was too long, she couldn't reach.\nHe was prising her fingers from the handle of the knife. His grip was iron\naround her neck. She couldn't breathe. She bared her teeth, struggling,\nsnarling, thrashing. All in vain.\n'Alive, brother! We want her alive!'\n'Alive,' murmured the man, 'but not unharmed.'\nThe woman giggled. Ferro's feet left the ground, kicking at the air. She\nfelt one of her fingers snap and the knife dropped to the grass. The hand\ngripped tighter round her neck, and she tore at it with broken nails. All in\nvain. The bright world began to turn dark.\nFerro heard the woman laughing, far away. A face swam out of the\ndarkness, a hand stroked Ferro's cheek. The fingers were soft, warm, gentle.\n'Be still, child,' whispered the woman. Her eyes were dark and deep.\nFerro could feel her breath, hot and fragrant on her face. 'You are hurt, you\nmust rest. Be still now… sleep.' Ferro's legs were heavy as lead. She kicked\nweakly, one last time, then her body sagged. Her heart beat slow…\n'Rest now.' Ferro's eyelids began to droop, the woman's beautiful face\ngrew blurred.\n'Sleep.' Ferro bit down hard on her tongue, and her mouth turned salty.\n'Be still.' Ferro spat blood in the woman's face.\n'Gah!' she shouted in disgust, wiping blood from her eyes. 'She fights\nme!'\n'Her kind fight everything,' came the man's voice, just behind Ferro's\near."

'You are coming with\nus! With us! One way or another! You hear me?'\n'She goes nowhere.' Another voice, deep and mellow. It seemed familiar.\nFerro blinked, shook her head groggily. The woman had turned, looking at\nan old man, not far away. Yulwei. His bangles jingled as he padded softly\nacross the grass. 'Are you alive, Ferro?'\n'Gugh,' she croaked.\nThe woman sneered at Yulwei. 'Who are you, old bastard?'\nYulwei sighed. 'I am an old bastard.'\n'Get you gone, dog!' shouted the man. 'We come from the Prophet. From\nKhalul himself!'\n'And she comes with us!'\nYulwei looked sad. 'I cannot change your minds?'\nThey laughed together. 'Fool!' cried the man. 'Our minds never change!'\nHe let go of one of Ferro's arms, took a wary step forwards, dragging her\nwith him.\n'A shame,' said Yulwei, shaking his head. 'I would have had you carry\nmy respects to Khalul.'\n'The Prophet does not walk with the likes of you, beggar!'\n'I might surprise you. We knew each other well, long ago.'\n'I will give our master your respects then,' jeered the woman, 'with the\nnews of your recent death!' Ferro twisted her wrist, felt the knife drop into\nher palm.\n'Oh, Khalul would enjoy that news, but he will not receive it yet. The\ntwo of you have cursed yourselves. You have broken the Second Law. You\nhave eaten the flesh of men, and there must be a reckoning.'\n'Old fool!' sneered the woman. 'Your laws do not apply to us!'\nYulwei slowly shook his head. 'The word of Euz governs all. There can\nbe no exceptions. Neither one of you will leave this place alive.' The air\naround the old man shimmered, twisted, blurred. The woman gave a gurgle\nand dropped suddenly to the earth, more than falling—melting, flopping,\ndark silk flapping around her collapsing body.\n'Sister!' The man let go of Ferro, sprang at Yulwei, arms outstretched.\nHe got no further than a stride. He gave a sudden, shrill scream and dropped\nto his knees, clutching at his head. Ferro forced her stumbling feet forward,\ngrabbed hold of his hair with her broken hand and drove the knife into his\nneck. Dust blew out into the wind. A fountain of dust. Flames flickered\naround his mouth, charring his lips black, licking burning hot at her fingers.\nShe dropped on top of him, bearing him back onto the ground, choking,\nsnorting. The blade opened up his stomach, scraped against his ribs,\nsnapped off in his chest. Fire licked out. Fire and dust. She hacked at the\nbody mindlessly with the broken knife, long after it had stopped moving."

There\nwas some scattered clapping as Filio strutted back to the contestant's\nenclosure with an irritating smile across his face. 'Slippery bastard,' Jezal\nhissed to himself as he followed. He should have seen that lunge coming.\nHe had been careless, and he knew it.\n'Two apiece?' hissed Varuz, as Jezal flopped down into his chair,\nbreathing hard. 'Two apiece? Against this nobody? He's not even from the\nUnion!'\nJezal knew better than to point out that Westport was supposed to be a\npart of the Union these days. He knew what Varuz meant, and so did\neveryone else in the arena. The man was an outsider as far as they were\nconcerned. He grabbed the cloth from Wests outstretched hands and wiped\nhis sweaty face. Five touches was a long match, but Filio looked far from\nexhausted. He was springing up and down on his toes as Jezal glanced\nacross, nodding his head to the noisy Styrian advice spilling from his\ntrainer."

Jezal\nwasn't entirely sure he wanted any of that.\nBut Varuz was in no doubt. 'Just damn well beat him!' hissed the\nMarshal, as Jezal took a swig from the bottle, swilled it round in his mouth.\n'Just beat him!' Jezal spat half out into the bucket and swallowed the rest.\nJust beat him. Easy to say, but he was a devious bastard, this Styrian.\n'You can do it!' said West again, rubbing Jezal's shoulder.

He could\nhear Filio's trainer shouting encouragements over the swelling noise of the\ncrowd. 'Just kill him!' shouted Varuz one last time, then Jezal was off on his\nway to the circle.\nThe deciding touch. The decider. In so many ways. Whether Jezal\nwould be in the final or not. Whether he would be somebody or not. He was\ntired though, very tired. He had been fencing solidly for nearly half an hour,\nin the heat, and that takes it out of you. He was sweating again already. He\ncould feel it leaking out of his face in big drops.\nHe moved towards his mark. A bit of chalk on some dry grass. Filio was\nstanding there waiting, still smiling, anticipating his triumph.

There was a lengthy pause.\n'It's your bet, Jezal,' grumbled Jalenhorm.\n'It is? Oh, er…' He scanned across the meaningless symbols, unable to\ntake any of it too seriously. 'Erm, oh… I'll fold.'

He was still no\ncloser to an answer, unfortunately.\nKaspa swept up the coins, smiling broadly at his most unlikely victory.\n'So that was well fought today, Jezal. A close one, but you came through,\neh?'\n'Uh,' said Jezal. He took his pipe from the table.\n'I swear, I thought he had you for a minute there, but then,' and he\nsnapped his fingers under Brint's nose, 'just like that! Knocked him right\nover. The crowd loved it! I laughed so hard I nearly wet myself, I swear!'\n'Do you reckon you can beat Gorst?' asked Jalenhorm.\n'Uh.'

Kaspa picked another. 'Have you fellows seen the\nPrincess Terez yet?'\nBrint and Jalenhorm sighed and gasped, then the three of them prattled\ntheir gormless appreciation of the woman.

And so on.\nJezal stayed where he was, sat back in his chair, blowing smoke at the\nsky. He wasn't so sure about Terez, from the little he'd seen. Beautiful from\na distance, no doubt, but he imagined that her face would feel like glass to\nthe touch: cold, hard and brittle. Nothing like Ardee's…\n'Still,' Jalenhorm was spouting, 'I have to say, Kaspa, my heart still\nbelongs to your cousin Ariss. Give me a Union girl any day over one of\nthese foreigners.'\n'Give you her money, you mean,' murmured Jezal, head still tipped\nback.\n'No!' complained the big man. 'She's a perfect lady! Sweet, demure,\nwell-bred. Ah!' Jezal smiled to himself. If Terez was cold glass, then Ariss\nwas a dead fish. Kissing her would be like kissing an old rag, he imagined:\nlimp and tedious. She couldn't kiss the way Ardee did. No one could…\n'Well, they're both of them beauties, no doubt,' Brint was blathering,\n'fine women to dream about, if dreams are all you're after…' He leaned\nforward to a conspiratorial distance, smirking shiftily round as though he\nhad something secret and exciting to say.

Brint licked\nhis lips and nudged Jalenhorm in the ribs. The big man grinned guiltily like\na schoolboy at a dirty joke. 'Oh yes, she strikes me as the willing type.'\nKaspa giggled. Jezal put his pipe down on the table, noticing that his hand\nwas trembling slightly. The other was gripping the arm of his chair so hard\nthat his knuckles were white.\n'I do declare,' said Brint, 'if I didn't think the Major would stick me with\nhis sword, I'd be tempted to stick his sister with mine, eh?' Jalenhorm\nspluttered with laughter. Jezal felt one of his eyes twitching as Brint turned\nhis smirk towards him. 'Well, Jezal, what do you think? You've met her\nhaven't you?'\n'What do I think?' His voice seemed to come from a terribly long way\naway as he stared at those three grinning faces. 'I think you should watch\nyour mouth, you son of a fucking whore.'\nHe was on his feet now, teeth gritted so tight together they felt like they\nmight crack apart. The three smiles blinked and faded. Jezal felt Kaspa's\nhand on his arm. 'Come on, he only meant—'\nJezal ripped his arm away, seized the edge of the table and flung it over.\nCoins, cards, bottles, glasses, flew through the air and spilled out across the\ngrass. He had his sword in his other hand, still sheathed luckily, leaning\nright down over Brint, spraying spit in his face. 'Now you fucking listen to\nme, you little bastard!' he snarled, 'I hear anything more like that, anything,\nand you won't have to worry about West!' He pressed the grip of his steel\ninto Brint's chest. 'I'll carve you like a fucking chicken!'\nThe three men stared up at him, aghast, their mouths wide open, their\nastonishment at this sudden display of violence equalled only by Jezal's\nown.\n'But—' said Jalenhorm.\n'What?' screamed Jezal, seizing a fistful of the big man's jacket and\ndragging him half out of his chair. 'What d'you fucking say?'\n'Nothing,' he squeaked, his hands raised, 'nothing.' Jezal let him drop.\nThe fury was draining fast. He had half a mind to apologise, but when he\nsaw Brint's ashen face all he could think of was 'she strikes me as the\nwilling type'.\n'Like! A! Fucking! Chicken!' he snarled again, then turned on his heel\nand stalked off. Halfway to the archway he realised he had left his coat\nbehind, but he could hardly go back for it now.

Brint's shocked voice echoed quietly\ndown the tunnel, only just audible over the thumping of Jezal's heart. He\nhad to hold his breath to hear.\n'Damned if I know.' Jalenhorm, sounding even more surprised. There\nwas the rattle and scrape of the table being put straight. 'Never knew he had\nsuch a temper.'\n'I suppose he must have a lot to think about,' said Kaspa, uncertainly,\n'what with the Contest and all…'\nBrint cut him off. 'That's no excuse!'\n'Well they're close, aren't they? Him and West? What with all the\nfencing together and what have you, maybe he knows the sister or\nsomething… I don't know!'\n'There is another explanation,' Jezal could hear Brint saying, voice tense\nas though he was about to deliver a punchline. 'Perhaps he's in love with\nher!' The three of them burst out laughing. It was a good joke alright.\nCaptain Jezal dan Luthar, in love, and with a girl whose station in life was\nso far beneath his own. What a ridiculous idea! What an absurd notion!\nWhat a joke!\n'Oh shit.' Jezal put his head in his hands. He didn't feel like laughing.\nHow the hell had she done this to him? How? What was it about her? She\nwas fine to look at, of course, and clever, and funny, and all those things,\nbut that was no explanation. 'I cannot see her again,' he whispered to\nhimself, 'I will not!' And he thumped his hand against the wall. His resolve\nwas iron. It always was.\nUntil the next note came under his door.\nHe groaned and slapped the side of his head. Why did he feel like this?\nWhy did he… he couldn't even bring himself to think the word… like her\nso much? Then it came to him. He knew why.\nShe didn't like him.\nThose mocking half-smiles. Those sidelong glances he caught\nsometimes. Those jokes that went just a little too close to the bone. Not to\nmention the occasional examples of outright scorn. She liked his money,\nmaybe. She liked his position in the world, of course. She liked his looks,\nundoubtedly. But, in essence, the woman despised him.\nAnd he'd never had that feeling before. He had always just assumed that\neverybody loved him, had never really had cause to doubt he was a fine\nman, worthy of the highest respect. But Ardee didn't like him, he saw it\nnow, and that made him think. Apart from the jaw, of course, and the money\nand the clothes, what was there to like?\nShe treated him with the contempt he knew he deserved. And he\ncouldn't get enough of it. 'Strangest thing,' Jezal mumbled to himself,\nslouching miserably against the wall of the tunnel. 'Strangest thing.'\nIt made him want to change her mind."

He snatched up his uniform trousers, shoving his legs in,\nfumbling with his belt.\n'Don't worry about that, Sand!' His mother's voice was half soothing,\nhalf impatient. 'Where is the Seed?'\nGlokta frowned over as he pushed his shirt in. 'I've no time for this\nnonsense, mother! Why do you always think you know what's best for me?'\nHe cast around him for his sword, but couldn't see it. 'We're at war you\nknow!'\n'We are indeed.' The Colonel looked up, surprised. It was the voice of\nArch Lector Sult. 'Two wars. One fought with fire and steel, and another\none beneath—an old war, long years in the making.' Glokta frowned. How\never could he have mistaken that old windbag for his mother? And what\nwas he doing in Glokta's chambers in any case? Sitting in the chair at the\nfoot of his bed, prattling about old wars?\n'What the hell are you doing in my chambers?' growled Colonel Glokta,\n'and what have you done with my sword?'\n'Where is the Seed?' A woman's voice now, but not his mother's.\nSomeone else. He did not recognise it. He squinted against the darkness,\nstraining to see who was in the chair. He could make out a vague outline,\nbut the shadows were too deep to tell more.\n'Who are you?' asked Glokta sternly.\n'Who was I? Or what am I?' The figure in the chair shifted as it rose\nslowly, smoothly, from its seat. 'I was a patient woman, but I am woman no\nmore, and the grinding years have worn my patience thin.'\n'What do you want?' Glokta's voice quivered, reedy and weak as he\nbacked away.\nThe figure moved, stepping through the shaft of moonlight from the\nwindow. A woman's form, slender and graceful, but shadows stuck to the\nface. A sudden fear clawed at him and he stumbled back against the wall,\nraising his arm to fend the woman off.\n'I want the Seed.' A pale hand snaked out and closed around his\noutstretched arm. A gentle touch, but cold. Cold as stone. Glokta trembled,\ngasped, squeezed shut his eyes. 'I need it. You cannot know the need I have.\nWhere is it?' Fingers plucked at his clothes, quick and deft, seeking,\nsearching, darting in his pockets, in his shirt, brushing his skin. Cold. Cold\nas glass.\n'The Seed?' squeaked Glokta, half paralysed with terror.\n'You know what I speak of, broken man. Where is it?'\n'The Maker fell…' he whispered. The words welled up, he knew not\nfrom where.\n'I know it.'\n'… burning, burning…'"

Something\nbrushed against his face, his cheek, his eyelid, soft and slimy. A tongue.\nCold. Cold as ice. His flesh crawled.\n'I don't know! They could not find it!'\n'Could not?' Fingers closed tight around his throat, squeezing, crushing,\nchoking the air from him. Cold. Cold as iron, and just as hard. 'You think\nyou know pain, broken man? You know nothing!' The icy breath rasped in\nhis ear, the icy fingers squeezed, squeezed. 'But I can show you! I can show\nyou!'\nGlokta screamed, thrashed, struggled. He fought his way up, stood for a\ndizzy instant, then his leg buckled and he plunged into space. The dark\nroom tumbled around him and he crashed to the boards with a sickening\ncrunch, his arm folded beneath him, his forehead cracking against the floor.\nHe struggled up, clawing at the leg of his bed, pushing himself against\nthe wall, snorting for breath, staring wild-eyed towards the chair, yet barely\nable to look for fear. A bar of moonlight spilled through the window, cut\nacross the rumpled bed-clothes and onto the polished wood of the seat.\nEmpty.\nGlokta cast around the rest of the room, eyes adjusting to the darkness,\npeering into every shadowy corner. Nothing. Empty. A dream.\nAnd now, as the crazy hammering of his heart relaxed, as his ragged\nbreathing slowed, the pain came on. His head thumped, his leg screamed,\nhis arm was throbbing dully. He could taste blood, his eyes stung and wept,\nhis guts heaved, sick and spinning. He whimpered, made an agonising hop\ntowards the bed, then collapsed on the moonlit mattress, exhausted, wet\nwith cold sweat.\nThere was an urgent knocking at the door. 'Sir? Are you alright?'\nBarnam's voice. The knocking came again. No good. It is locked. Always\nlocked, but I don't think I'll be moving. Frost will have to break it down. But\nthe door swung open, and Glokta shielded his eyes from the sudden ruddy\nglow of the old servant's lamp.\n'Are you alright?'\n'I fell,' mumbled Glokta. 'My arm…'\nThe old servant perched on the bed, taking Glokta's hand gently and\npushing up the sleeve of his night-shirt. Glokta winced, Barnam clicked his\ntongue. His forearm had a big pink mark across it, already beginning to\nswell and redden.\n'I don't think it's broken,' said the servant, 'but I should fetch the\nsurgeon, just in case.'\n'Yes, yes.' He waved Barnam away with his good hand. 'Fetch him.'"

'Fetch him.'\nGlokta watched the old servant hurry, stooped, out of the door, heard\nhim creaking along the narrow corridor outside, down the narrow stairs. He\nheard the front door banging shut. Silence descended.\nHe looked over at the scroll he had taken from the Adeptus Historical,\nstill rolled up tight on the dresser, waiting to be delivered to Arch Lector\nSult. The Maker fell burning. He broke upon the bridge below. Strange, how\nparts of the waking world stray into one's dreams. That damned Northman\nand his intruder. A woman, and cold. That'll be what set me off.\nGlokta rubbed his arm gently, pressing the sore flesh with his fingertips.\nNothing. Just a dream. And yet something was niggling at him. He looked\nover at the back of the door. The key was still in the lock, shining orange in\nthe light from the lamp. Not locked, and yet I must have locked it. Must\nhave. I always do. Glokta looked back to the empty chair. What did that\nidiot apprentice say? Magic comes from the Other Side. The world below.\nHell.\nSomehow, at that moment, after that dream, it did not seem so difficult\nto believe. The fear was building in him again, now he was alone. He\nstretched out his good hand towards the chair. It took an age to get there,\ntrembling, shaking. His fingers touched the wood. Cool, but not cold. Not\ncold. There is nothing there. He slowly withdrew his hand, cradled his\npulsing arm. Nothing. Empty.\nA dream.\n'What the hell happened to you?'\nGlokta sucked sourly at his gums. 'Fell out of bed.' He scratched\nabsently at his wrist through the dressing. Until a moment ago it had been\nthrobbing like hell, but the sight in front of him had pushed the pain into the\nback of his mind. I could be worse off. A lot worse. 'Not a pretty sight. Not\nat all.'\n'You're damn right it's not.' Severard looked as disgusted as was possible\nwith half his face covered. 'I nearly puked when I first saw it. Me!'\nGlokta peered down, frowning, at the tangled mess of butchery,\nsupporting himself against a tree-trunk with one hand and pushing some of\nthe ferns aside with the tip of his cane to get a better look. 'Are we even\nsure it's a man?'\n'Might be a woman. Human anyway. That's a foot.'\n'Ah, so it is. How was it found?'\n'He found it.' Severard nodded over towards a gardener: sat on the\nground, pale-faced and staring, and with a small pool of drying vomit on the\ngrass beside him. 'In amongst the trees here, hidden in the bushes. Looks as\nif whatever killed it tried to hide it, but not long ago. It's fresh.' It is indeed\n—barely any smell, and only a couple of flies have arrived. Very fresh,\nperhaps last night even.

That was quite a mess, though not\nnear as bad as this one.'\n'I can't see anyone freezing to death last night. It was hot as hell.'\n'Mmm,' said Glokta. If hell is hot. I've always thought it might be cold.\nCold as ice. 'There are few bears within the Agriont in any case. Do we\nhave any idea as to the identity of this…' he waved his cane towards the\ncarcass '… person?'\n'None.'\n'Is anyone unaccounted for?

'Mysterious intruders in the dead of night,\ngruesome murders on their very doorstep? Our visitors draw trouble like\nshit draws flies.'\n'Huh,' said Severard, swatting a fly away with his gloved hand. 'I looked\ninto that other thing as well. Your bankers. Valint and Balk.'\nGlokta looked up. 'Really? And?'\n'And not a lot. An old house. Very old and very well respected. Their\nnotes are good as gold among the merchants. They've got offices all across\nMidderland, Angland, Starikland, in Westport, in Dagoska. Even outside the\nUnion. Powerful people, by all accounts. All kind of folk owe them money,\nI reckon. Strange thing though, no one seems ever to have met a Valint or a\nBalk. Who can tell with banks though, eh? They love secrets. You want me\nto dig any more?'\nIt could be dangerous. Very dangerous. Dig too far and we might be\ndigging our own graves. 'No. We'd better leave off. For now. Keep your ears\nopen though.'\n'My ears are always open, chief. So who do you like for the Contest?'\nGlokta glanced across at the Practical. 'How can you think about that\nwith this in front of you?'\nThe Practical shrugged. 'It won't do 'em any harm, will it?' Glokta\nlooked back at the mangled body. I suppose it wont, at that. 'So come on,\nyou should know, Luthar or Gorst?'\n'Gorst.' I hope he carves the little bastard in two.\n'Really?

The Adeptus\nPhysical paused in his work and peered over at Glokta, one eye enormously\nmagnified through his glittering eyeglass. 'Quite a fascinating discovery,' he\nmuttered, as he returned to the corpse with his instruments: lifting,\nprodding, twisting, squinting down at the glistening flesh.\nGlokta peered round the laboratory, his lip curling with distaste. Jars of\nmany different sizes lined two of the four walls, filled with floating, pickled\nlumps of meat. Some of those floating things Glokta recognised as parts of\nthe human body, some he did not. Even he felt slightly uncomfortable in\namongst the macabre display. I wonder how Kandelau came by them all?\nDo his visitors end up dismembered, floating in a dozen different jars?\nPerhaps I would make an interesting specimen?\n'Fascinating.' The Adeptus loosened the strap of his eye-glass and\nperched it on top of his head, rubbing at the pink ring it had left behind\naround his eye. 'What can you tell me about it?'\nGlokta frowned.

There was a new arrival there, one that\nhe had not heard enter. A woman, standing in the shadows at the edge of the\nbright lamp-light with her arms folded. A tall woman with short, spiky red\nhair and a black mask on her face, staring at Glokta and the Adeptus\nthrough narrowed eyes. A Practical.

He laughed\nsoftly to himself and shook his head.\nAnd this is the Inquisition? I had no idea the circus was in town. I\nwonder if they stand on each other's shoulders? Or jump through flaming\nhoops?\n'A remarkably diverse selection,' said Glokta.\n'Oh yes,' laughed Goyle, 'I have picked them up wherever my travels\nhave taken me, eh my friends?'\nThe woman shrugged as she prowled around the jars. The dark-skinned\nPractical inclined his head. The towering Northman simply stood there.\n'Wherever my travels have taken me!' chuckled Goyle, just as though\neveryone else had laughed with him. 'And I have more besides! It's been\nquite a time, I do declare!' He wiped a tear of mirth from his eye as he\nmoved towards the table in the centre of the room. It seemed that\neverything was a source of amusement to him, even the thing on the bench.\n'But what's all this? A body, unless I'm quite mistaken!' Goyle looked up\nsharply, his eyes sparkling. 'A body? A death within the city? As Superior of\nAdua, surely that falls within my province?'\nGlokta bowed. 'Naturally. I was not aware that you had arrived,\nSuperior Goyle. Also, I felt that the unusual circumstances of this—'\n'Unusual? I see nothing unusual.' Glokta paused. What game is this\nchuckling fool playing?\n'Surely you would agree that the violence here is… exceptional.'\nGoyle gave a flamboyant shrug. 'Dogs.'\n'Dogs?' asked Glokta, unable to let that one pass. 'Domestic pets run\nmad, do you think, or wild ones which climbed over the walls?'\nThe Superior only smiled.

I never believed that I\nwould miss Superior Kalyne, but suddenly I am overcome with nostalgia.\nGoyle turned slowly round, bowing low. 'My first day here, and already I\nwarm to the work! You can bury this,' he said, gesturing to the corpse and\nsmiling broadly at the cringing Adeptus. 'Best buried, eh?' He looked over\nat the Northman. 'Back to the mud, as you say in your country!'\nThe massive Practical showed not the slightest sign that anyone had\nspoken. The Kantic was standing there, turning the ring through his ear\nround and round. The woman was peering down at the carcass on the table,\nsniffing at it through her mask. The Adeptus Physical was backed up\nagainst his jars, sweating profusely.\nEnough of this pantomime. I have work to do. 'Well,' said Glokta stiffly,\nlimping for the door, 'the mystery is solved. You don't need me any more.'\nSuperior Goyle turned to look at him, his good humour suddenly\nvanished. 'No!' he hissed, furious little eyes nearly popping out of his head.\n'We don't… need you… any more!'\nNever Bet Against a Magus\n« ^ »\nLogen sat in the hot sun, hunched over on his bench, and sweated. The\nridiculous clothes did not help with the sweating, or indeed with anything\nelse. The tunic had not been designed to sit down in, and the stiff leather\ndug painfully into his fruits whenever he tried to move.\n'Fucking thing,' he growled, tugging at it for the twentieth time. Quai\nlooked hardly more comfortable in his magical garb—the glittering of the\ngold and silver symbols only served to make his face look the more ill and\npallid, his eyes the more twitchy and bulging. He'd hardly spoken a word all\nmorning.

Even though the benches were packed shoulder to\nshoulder a small, nervous space had built up around the three of them where\nno one would sit.\nThe noise was even more crushing than the heat and the crowds.\nLogen's ears hummed with the din. It was the most he could do to keep\nfrom clamping his hands over them and throwing himself under the bench\nfor cover. Bayaz leaned towards him. 'Was this what your duels were like?'\nHe had to shout even though his mouth was barely six inches from Logen's\near.\n'Huh.' Even when Logen had fought Rudd Threetrees, when a good part\nof Bethod's army had drawn up in a great half-circle to watch, shouting and\nscreaming and hammering their weapons against their shields, when the\nwalls of Uffrith above them had been crammed with onlookers, his\naudience had not been half this size, not half this noisy. No more than thirty\nmen had watched him kill Shama Heartless, kill him then butcher him like a\npig. Logen winced and flinched and hunched his shoulders higher at the\nmemory of it. Cutting, and cutting, and licking the blood from his fingers,\nwhile the Dogman stared in horror and Bethod laughed and cheered him on.\nHe could taste the blood now, and he shuddered and wiped his mouth.\nThere had been so many fewer people, and yet the stakes had been so\nmuch higher. The lives of the fighters, for one thing, and the ownership of\nland, of villages, of towns, the futures of whole clans. When he'd fought Tul\nDuru, no more than a hundred had watched, but perhaps the whole fate of\nthe North had turned on that bloody half hour. If he'd lost then, if the\nThunderhead had killed him, would things be the same? If Black Dow, or\nHarding Grim, or any of those others had put him in the mud, would Bethod\nhave a golden chain now, and call himself a King? Would this Union be at\nwar with the North? The thought made his head hurt. Even more.\n'You alright?' asked Bayaz.\n'Mmm,' Logen mumbled, but he was shivering, even in the heat. What\nwere all these people here for? Only to be amused. Few could've found\nLogen's battles very amusing, except Bethod, perhaps. Few others. 'This\nisn't like my fights,' he muttered to himself.\n'What's that?' asked Bayaz.\n'Nothing.'\n'Uh.' The old man beamed around at the crowd, scratching at his short\ngrey beard. 'Who do you think will win?'\nLogen really didn't much care, but he reckoned that any distraction from\nhis memories was welcome. He peered into the enclosures where the two\nfighters were getting ready, not far from where he was sitting. The\nhandsome, proud young man they'd met at the gate was one of them. The\nother was heavy and powerful-looking, with a thick neck and a look almost\nbored.\nHe shrugged his shoulders. 'I don't know anything about this business.'\n'What, you? The Bloody-Nine?

The most feared man in the North? No opinion? Surely single\ncombat is the same the world over!'\nLogen winced and licked his lips. The Bloody-Nine. That was far in the\npast, but not far enough for his liking. His mouth still tasted like metal, like\nsalt, like blood. Touching a man with a sword and cutting him open with\none are hardly the same things, but he looked the two opponents over again.\nThe proud young man rolled up his sleeves, touched his toes, swivelled his\nbody this way and that, swung his arms round in quick windmills, watched\nby a stern old soldier in a spotless red uniform. A tall, worried-looking man\nhanded the fighter two thin swords, one longer than the other, and he\nwhisked them around before him in the air with impressive speed, blades\nflashing.\nHis opponent stood there, leaning against the wooden side of his\nenclosure, stretching his bull neck from side to side without much hurry,\nglancing round with lazy eyes.\n'Who's who?' asked Logen.\n'The pompous ass from the gate is Luthar. The one who's half asleep is\nGorst.'\nIt was plain who the crowd preferred. Luthar's name could be heard\noften in the din, and whoops and claps greeted every movement of his thin\nswords. He looked quick, and deft, and clever, but there was something\ndeadly in that big man's waiting slouch, something dark about his heavy-\nlidded eyes. Logen would rather have fought Luthar, for all his speed. 'I\nreckon Gorst.'\n'Gorst, really?' Bayaz' eyes sparkled. 'How about a little bet?'\nLogen heard a sharp suck of breath from Quai. 'Never bet against a\nMagus,' whispered the apprentice.\nIt didn't seem to make much difference to Logen. 'What the hell have I\ngot to bet with?'\nBayaz shrugged. 'Well, let's just say for honour then?'\n'If you like.' Logen had never had too much of that, and the little he did\nhave he didn't care about losing.\n'Bremer dan Gorst!' The scattered clapping was smothered by an avalanche\nof hisses and boos as the great ox shambled towards his mark, half-closed\neyes on the ground, big, heavy steels dangling from his big, heavy hands.\nBetween his short-cropped hair and the collar of his shirt, where his neck\nshould have been, there was nothing but a thick fold of muscle.\n'Ugly bastard,' Jezal murmured to himself, as he watched him go. 'Damn\nidiot ugly bastard.' But his curses lacked conviction, even to his own ear. He\nhad watched that man fight three bouts and demolish three good opponents.\nOne of them had still to leave his sick bed a week later. Jezal had been\ntraining for the last few days specifically to counter Gorst's bludgeoning\nstyle: Varuz and West swinging big broom handles at him while he dodged\nthis way and that.

The boos only\nbecame louder, joined by jeers and heckling as Gorst took his mark.\n'You clumsy ox!'\n'Get back to your farm and pull a plough!'\n'Bremer the brute!' and other such.\nThe people stretched back, and back, and back into obscurity. Everyone\nwas there. Everyone in the world, it looked like. Every commoner in the\ncity round the distant edges. Every gentleman, artisan and trader thronging\nthe middle benches. Every noble man or woman in the Agriont towards the\nfront, from fifth sons of high-born nobodies to the great magnates of the\nOpen and Closed Councils. The Royal box was full: the Queen, the two\nPrinces, Lord Hoff, the Princess Terez. The King even appeared to be\nawake for once, truly an honour, his goggling eyes staring around in\namazement. Out there somewhere were Jezal's father and his brothers, his\nfriends and fellow officers, his entire acquaintance, more or less. Ardee too,\nhe hoped, watching…\nAll in all, it was quite an audience.\n'Jezal dan Luthar!' bellowed the referee. The meaningless bibble-babble\nof the crowd surged into a storm of cheering, a thunderous wave of support.\nThe cries and shouts rang and echoed around the arena, making Jezal's head\nthrob.\n'Come on, Luthar!'\n'Luthar!'\n'Kill the bastard!' and other such.\n'Off you go, Jezal,' whispered Marshal Varuz in his ear, clapping him on\nthe back and pushing him gently out towards the circle, 'and good luck!'\nJezal walked in a daze, the noise of the crowd punching at his ears until\nit seemed his head would split. The training of the last few months flashed\nthrough his mind. The running, the swimming, the work with the heavy bar.\nThe sparring, the beam, the endless forms. The punishment, the study, the\nsweating and the pain. Just so he could stand here. Seven touches. The first\nto four. It all came down to this.\nHe took his mark opposite Gorst, and stared into those heavy-lidded\neyes. They looked back, cool and calm, seeming almost to stare past him as\nthough he wasn't there. That needled him and he pushed the thoughts out of\nhis head and raised high his noble chin. He would not, could not, let this oaf\nget the better of him. He would show all these people his blood, and his\nskill, and his mettle. He was Jezal dan Luthar. He would win. It was an\nincontestable fact. He knew it.\n'Begin!'\nThe first cut sent him reeling, shattering his confidence, his poise, and\nnearly his wrist.

He had been watching Gorst fence, of course, if you could\ncall it that, so he knew the man would come out swinging, but nothing\ncould have prepared him for that first shattering contact. The crowd gasped\nwith him as he staggered back. All his carefully laid plans, all of Varuz'\ncarefully worded advice, vanished into air. He winced with pain and shock,\nhis arm still vibrating from the force of that mighty blow, his ears still\nringing from the crashing noise of it, his mouth hanging open, his knees\nwobbling.\nIt was hardly the most promising start, but the next chop followed hard\nafter the first, flashing down with even greater power. Jezal leaped aside\nand slid away, trying to make room and give himself time. Time to work out\nsome tactic, some trick to stem the pitiless tide of swinging metal. But\nGorst was not about to give him time. He was already loosing another\nthroaty growl, his long steel already begun on its next irresistible arc.\nJezal dodged where he could, blocked where he couldn't, his wrists\nalready aching from the ceaseless punishment. To begin with he hoped that\nGorst would tire. No one could throw those great lumps of metal around for\nlong the way that he was doing. Soon the fierce pace would take its toll on\nthe big man and he would slow, and droop, and the heavy steels would lose\ntheir venom. Then Jezal would fight back doggedly, run his opponent\nragged, and win. The crowd would crack the Agriont with their cheers. A\nclassic tale of victory against the odds.\nOnly Gorst did not tire. The man was a machine. After a few minutes\nthere was still not the slightest sign of weariness in those heavy-lidded eyes.\nThere was barely any emotion of any kind that Jezal could see, during the\nrare moments when he dared to take his eyes away from the flashing\nswords. The big long steel swung, swung, swung in its brutal circles, and\nthe short steel was always there to turn away such feeble efforts as Jezal\ncould make in between, never faltering or dropping even an inch. The\npower of the blows did not decrease, the growls tore from Gorst's throat\nwith as much vigour as ever. The crowd were given nothing to cheer at, and\nmerely muttered angrily. It was Jezal who began to feel his legs slowing, to\nfeel the sweat springing out of his forehead, to feel his grip on his steels\nslipping.\nHe saw it coming from a mile away, but there was nothing he could do\nabout it. He had backed off until he ran out of circle. He had blocked and\nparried until he lost the feeling in his fingers. This time, when he raised his\naching arm and there was the crash of metal on metal, one tired foot slipped\nand he tumbled squawking from the ring, floundering on his side, his short\nsteel spinning from his twitching fingers. His face slapped against the\nground and he took a gritty mouthful of sand. It was a painful and\nembarrassing fall, but he felt too tired and too battered to be all that\ndisappointed. He was almost relieved that the punishment was over, if only\nfor a moment."

A light dusting of applause was\ncrushed beneath hoots of derision, but the big man seemed scarcely to\nnotice, shuffling back to his mark with his head down and already preparing\nfor the next touch.\nJezal rolled slowly onto his hands and knees, flexing his aching hands\nand taking his time getting up. He needed a moment to breathe and make\nready, to think up some strategy. Gorst waited for him: big, silent, still. Jezal\nbrushed the sand from his shirt, mind racing. How to beat him? How? He\nstepped cautiously back to his mark, raised his steels.\n'Begin!'\nThis time Gorst came out even harder, slashing away as if he was\nscything wheat, making Jezal dance around the circle. One blow passed so\nclose to his left side that he could feel the wind from it on his cheek. The\nnext missed him by a margin no greater on his right. Then Gorst flung a\nsideways sweep aimed at his head and Jezal saw an opening. He ducked\nbeneath it, sure the blade tore at the hairs on top of his scalp. He closed the\ndistance as the heavy long steel swung away, almost catching the referee in\nthe face on the back-swing, leaving Gorst's right side all but undefended.\nJezal lunged at the big bastard, sure he had finally got through, knowing\nhe had made it one touch apiece. But Gorst caught the thrust on his short\nsteel and forced it just wide, the guards of the two blades scraping then\nlocking together. Jezal cut at him viciously with his short steel but somehow\nGorst blocked that too, bringing up his other sword just in time, catching\nJezal's blade and holding it just short of his chest.\nFor a moment their four steels were locked together, hilts grating, their\nfaces just a few inches apart. Jezal was snarling like a dog, teeth bared, the\nmuscles of his face a rigid mask. Gorst's heavy features showed little sign\nof effort. He looked like a man having a piss: involved in a mundane and\nfaintly distasteful task that must simply be done with as quickly as possible.\nFor a moment their blades were locked together, Jezal pushing with\nevery grain of strength, each hard-trained muscle flexing: legs straining\nagainst the ground, stomach straining to twist his arms, arms straining to\npush his hands, hands gripped around the hilts of his steels like grim death.\nEvery muscle, every sinew, every tendon. He knew he had the better\nposition, the big man was off balance, if only he could push him back a\nstep… an inch…\nFor that moment their steels were locked together, then Gorst dipped his\nshoulder, and grunted, and flung Jezal away as a child might fling away a\nboring toy.\nHe tumbled back, mouth and eyes wide open with surprise, feet kicking\nat the dirt, all his attention focused on staying upright.

He raised his left arm on an instinct, but the thick, blunted\nblade tore his short steel away like a straw on the wind and crashed into his\nribs, hammering the breath from his body in a wail of pain that echoed\nround and round the silent arena. His legs crumpled under him and he\nsprawled out on the turf, limbs flopping, sighing like a split bellows.\nThis time there was not even the shadow of applause. The crowd roared\ntheir hatred, booing and hissing at Gorst for all they were worth as he\ntrudged back to his enclosure.\n'Damn you, Gorst, you thug!'\n'Get up Luthar! Up and at him!'\n'Go home, you brute!'\n'You damn savage!'\nTheir hisses turned to half-hearted cheers as Jezal picked himself up off\nthe grass, his whole left side pulsing. He would have screamed with the\npain if he had any breath left in him. For all his effort, for all his training, he\nwas utterly outclassed and he knew it. The thought of doing it all again next\nyear made him want to vomit. He did his best to appear undaunted as he\nstruggled back to his enclosure, but he could not help sagging down heavily\nin his chair when he got there, dropping his notched steels on the flags and\ngasping for breath.\n'West bent over him and pulled up his shirt to check the damage.

'I don't think\nso, but damn it!' West threw his towel down in disgust. 'You call this the\nbeautiful sport? Is there no rule against these heavy steels?'\nVaruz shook his head grimly. 'They all have to be the same length, but\nthere's no rule for the weight. I mean, why would anyone want heavy ones?'\n'Now we know, don't we!' snapped West. 'Are you sure we shouldn't\nstop this before that bastard takes his head off?'\nVaruz ignored him. 'Now look here,' said the old Marshal, leaning down\nto talk in Jezal's face. 'It's the best of seven touches! First to four! There's\nstill time!'\nTime for what? For Jezal to get cut in half, blunted steels or no? 'He's\ntoo strong!' Jezal gasped.\n'Too strong? No one's too strong for you!' But even Varuz looked\ndoubtful. 'There's still time! You can beat him!' The old Marshal tugged at\nhis moustaches.

He had not been handling his\nleft side at all well since he took that blow in the ribs, and Glokta could\nalmost feel his pain. And my, my, how nice it is to feel someone else's for a\nchange. The crowd sulked, silent and brooding as Gorst harried their\nfavourite around with his brutal slashes, while Glokta spluttered giggles\nthrough his clenched gums.\nLuthar was quick and flashy, and he moved well once he saw the steels\ncoming. A competent fighter. Good enough to win a Contest, no doubt, in a\nmediocre year. Quick feet, and quick hands, but his mind is not as sharp as\nit should be. As it needs to be. He is too predictable.\nGorst was an entirely different proposition. He seemed to be swinging,\nand swinging, without a thought in his head. But Glokta knew better. He\nhas a whole new way of doing things. It was all jab, jab in my day. By next\nyear's Contest they'll all be chopping away with these big, heavy steels.\nGlokta wondered idly if he could have beaten Gorst, at his best. It would\nhave been a bout worth seeing anyway—a damn sight better than this\nmismatch.\nGorst easily dealt with a couple of limp jabs, then Glokta winced and\nthe crowd hissed as Luthar just barely parried another great butcher's chop,\nthe force of it nearly lifting him off his feet. He had no way to avoid the\nnext swing, pressed against the edge of the circle as he was, and he was\nforced to jump back into the sand.\n'Three to nothing!' shouted the referee.\nGlokta shook with merriment as he watched Luthar chop at the ground\nin frustration, sending up a petulant spray of sand, his face a picture of pale\nself-pity. Dear me, Captain Luthar, it will be four to nothing. A whitewash.\nAn embarrassment. Perhaps this will teach that whining little shit some\nhumility. Some men are better off for a good beating. Only look at me, eh?\n'Begin!'\nThe fourth touch began precisely as the third had ended. With Luthar\ntaking a hammering. Glokta could see it, the man was out of ideas. His left\narm was moving slowly, painfully, his feet looked heavy. Another numbing\nblow crashed against his long steel, making him stumble back towards the\nedge of the circle, off-balance and gasping. Gorst needed only to press his\nattack a little further. And something tells me he is not the man to let up\nwhen he's ahead. Glokta grabbed his cane, pushed himself to his feet.\nAnyone could see it was all over, and he had no wish to be caught in the\ncrush as the disappointed crowds all tried to leave at once.\nGorst's heavy long steel flashed down through the air.

No. He had fought hundreds of touches in his youth, and\nwatched thousands more, but he had never seen anything quite like that,\nnever seen anyone move so quickly. Luthar was a good swordsman, he\nknew it. But no one is that good. He frowned as he watched the two finalists\ncome out from their second break and take their marks.\n'Begin!'\nLuthar was transformed.

Glokta did not share their enthusiasm.\nSomething is wrong here. Something is wrong. He glanced across the faces\nnearby, but no one else had sensed anything amiss. They only saw what\nthey wanted to see: Luthar giving the ugly brute a spectacular and well-\ndeserved thrashing. Glokta's eyes scanned across the benches, not knowing\nwhat he was looking for.\nBayaz, so-called. Sitting near the front, leaning forward and staring at\nthe two fighters with fixed concentration, his 'apprentice' and the scarred\nNorthman beside him. No one else noticed it, everyone was intent on the\nfighters before them, but Glokta did. He rubbed his eyes and looked again.\nSomething wrong.\n'Say one thing for the First of the Magi, say he's a cheating bastard,'\ngrowled Logen.\nBayaz had a little smile at the corner of his mouth as he mopped the\nsweat from his forehead. 'Who ever said he wasn't?'\nLuthar was in trouble again. Bad trouble. Each time he blocked one of\nthose heavy sweeps, his swords snapped back further, his grip seemed\nslacker. Each time he dodged, he ended up a little further back towards the\nedge of the yellow circle.\nThen, when the end seemed certain, out of the corner of his eye, Logen\nsaw the air above Bayaz' shoulders shimmer, as it had on the road south"

He caught the next great\nblow on the grip of his short sword. A moment before, it might easily have\nsent the thing flying from his hand. Now he held it there for an instant, then\nflung it away with a cry, pushing his opponent off balance and jumping\nforward, suddenly on the attack.\n'If you were caught cheating in a Northern duel,' growled Logen,\nshaking his head, 'they'd cut the bloody cross into your stomach and pull\nyour guts out.'\n'Lucky for me,' murmured Bayaz through gritted teeth, without taking\nhis eyes away from the fighters, 'that we are in the North no longer.' Sweat\nwas already beading his bald scalp again, running down his face in fat\ndrops. His fists were clenched tight and trembling with effort.\nLuthar struck furiously, again and again, his swords a flashing blur.\nGorst grunted and growled as he turned the blows away, but Luthar was too\nquick for him now, and too strong. He drove him mercilessly across the\ncircle like a crazy dog might drive a cow.\n'Fucking cheating,' growled Logen again, as Luthar's blade flashed and\nleft a bright red line across Gorst's cheek. A few drops of blood spattered\nacross into the crowd on Logen's left, and they exploded into riotous\ncheering. That, just for a moment, was a shadow of his own duels. The\nreferee's cry of three apiece could hardly be heard at all. Gorst frowned\nslightly and touched one hand to his face.\nAbove the din, Logen could just hear Quai's whisper. 'Never bet against\na Magus…'\nJezal knew that he was good, but he had never dreamed he could be this\ngood. He was sharp as a cat, nimble as a fly, strong as a bear. His ribs no\nlonger hurt, his wrists no longer hurt, all trace of tiredness had left him, all\ntrace of doubt. He was fearless, peerless, unstoppable. The applause\nthundered around him and yet he could hear every word of it, see every\ndetail of every face in the crowd. His heart was pumping tingling fire\ninstead of blood, his lungs were sucking in the very clouds.\nHe did not bother even to sit in the break, so great was his eagerness to\nget back into the circle. The chair was an insult to him. He was not listening\nto what Varuz and West were saying. They were of no importance. Little\npeople, far below. They stared at him: flushed, amazed, as well they might\nbe.\nHe was the greatest swordsman ever.\nThat cripple Glokta could not have known how right he was: Jezal had\nonly to try, it seemed, and he could have anything he wanted.

Those eyes were still heavy-lidded, lazy above the little red cut\nthat Jezal had given him, but there was something else there now as well: a\ntrace of shock, of wariness, of respect. As well there might be.\nThere was nothing that Jezal could not do. He was invincible. He was\nunstoppable. He was…\n'Begin!'\n… completely lost. The pain lanced through his side and made him\ngasp. Suddenly he was afraid, and tired, and weak again. Gorst growled and\nunleashed his savage cuts, jarring the steels in Jezal's hands, making him\njump like a frightened rabbit. The mastery was gone, the anticipation, the\nnerve, and Gorst's onslaught was more brutal than ever. He felt a terrible\nlurch of despair as his long steel was torn from his buzzing fingers, flew\nthrough the air and clattered into the barrier. Jezal was bludgeoned to his\nknees. The crowd gasped. It was all over…\n… It was not over. The blow was arcing down towards him. The final\nblow. It seemed to drift. Slow, slow, as though through honey. Jezal smiled.\nIt was a simple matter for him to push it away with his short steel. The\nstrength flowed again. He sprang upwards, shoved Gorst away with his\nempty hand, flicked another swing aside, and then another, his one sword\ndoing the work of two with time to spare. The arena was breathless silent\nbut for the rapid clashing of the steels. Right and left, right and left went the\nshort blade, flashing faster than his eye could follow, faster than his mind\ncould think, seeming almost to be dragging him along behind it.\nThere was a squeal of metal on metal as it tore Gorst's notched long\nsteel from his hand, then another as it flickered across and did the same\nwith his short. For a moment, all was still. The big man, disarmed and with\nhis heels on the very edge of the circle, looked up at Jezal. The crowd was\nsilent.\nThen Jezal slowly lifted his short steel, all of a sudden seeming to weigh\na ton, and poked Gorst gently in the ribs with it.\n'Huh,' said the big man quietly, raising his eyebrows.\nThen the crowd exploded into deafening applause. The noise went on\nand on, rising and rising, washing over Jezal in waves. Now that it was\nfinished he felt drained beyond description. He closed his eyes, swaying,\nhis sword dropped from his nerveless fingers and he sank to his knees. He\nwas beyond exhaustion. It was as though he had used a whole week's\nenergy in a few moments. Even kneeling was an effort he was not sure he\ncould sustain for long, and if he fell he was not sure he could ever get up\nagain.\nBut then he felt strong hands taking him under the arms, and felt\nhimself being lifted. The noise of the crowd grew even louder as he was\nhoisted into the air. He opened his eyes—bleary, blurry colour flashed in"

He opened his eyes—bleary, blurry colour flashed in\nfront of him as he was turned around. His head rang with the sound. He was\nup on someone's shoulders. A shaved head. Gorst. The big man had lifted\nhim up, as a father might lift his child, displaying him to the crowd, smiling\nup at him with a big, ugly grin. Jezal smiled back despite himself. It was a\nstrange moment, all in all.\n'Luthar wins!' cried the referee pointlessly, barely audible. 'Luthar wins!'\nThe cheering had resolved itself into a steady chant of 'Luthar! Luthar!\nLuthar!' The arena shook with it. Jezal's head swam with it. It was like\nbeing drunk. Drunk on victory. Drunk on yourself.\nGorst lowered him back to the circle as the cheering of the crowd began\nto fade. 'You beat me,' he said, smiling wide. His voice was strangely high\nand soft, almost like a woman's. 'Fair and square. I'd like to be the first to\ncongratulate you.' And he nodded his big head and smiled again, rubbing at\nthe cut under his eye without the slightest bitterness. 'You deserve it,' he\nsaid, holding out his hand.\n'Thank you.' Jezal flashed a sour smile and gave the man's big paw as\ncursory a squeeze as possible, then he turned away towards his enclosure.\nOf course he fucking deserved it, and he was damned if he would let that\nbastard bask in his reflected glory a moment longer.\n'Bravely done, my boy, bravely done!' frothed Marshal Varuz, slapping\nhim on the shoulder as he stumbled back to his chair on wobbly legs. 'I\nknew you could do it!'\nWest grinned as he handed him the towel. 'They'll be talking about this\nfor years.'\nOther well-wishers crowded in, offering their congratulations, leaning\nover the barrier. A whirl of smiling faces, and in amongst them the face of\nJezal's father, shining with pride. 'I knew that you could do it, Jezal! I never\ndoubted! Not for a minute! You've brought honour to our family!' Jezal\nnoticed that his elder brother didn't look all that pleased about it, though. He\nhad the usual stodgy, envious expression on his face, even at Jezal's\nmoment of victory. The stodgy, envious bastard. Could he not be happy for\nhis brother, if only for one day?\n'May I too congratulate the winner?' came a voice from over his\nshoulder. It was that old idiot, the one from the gate, the one whom Sulfur\nhad called his master. The one who had used the name Bayaz. He had sweat\non his bald skull, a lot of it. His face was pale, his eyes sunken. Almost as if\nhe had just done seven touches with Gorst. 'Well done indeed, my young\nfriend, an almost… magical performance.'\n'Thank you,' muttered Jezal. He was not at all sure who this old man\nwas, or what he was after, but he did not trust him in the least. 'I am sorry\nthough, I must—'"

He said it with a disturbing finality, as if it\nwere a thing already arranged. Then he turned away and vanished smoothly\ninto the crowds. Jezal's father stared after him, ashen-faced now, as though\nhe had seen a ghost.\n'Do you know him, father?'\n'Jezal!' Varuz grabbed his arm excitedly. 'Come! The King wishes to\ncongratulate you!' He dragged Jezal from his family and towards the circle.\nA scattering of applause rose up again as they walked together across the\ndry grass, the scene of Jezal's victory. The Lord Marshal slung a fatherly\narm around his shoulder, and smiled up at the crowds as though the\napplause was all for him. Everyone wanted a piece of his glory, it seemed,\nbut Jezal was able to shake the old man off as he mounted the steps of the\nroyal box.\nPrince Raynault, youngest son of the King, was first in line, humbly\ndressed, honest and thoughtful-seeming, scarcely looking like royalty at all.\n'Well done!' he shouted over the roar of the crowd, sounding truly delighted\nfor Jezal's victory. 'Well done indeed!' His older brother was more\nexuberant.\n'Incredible!' shouted Crown Prince Ladisla, the sunlight glinting off the\ngolden buttons on his white jacket. 'Capital! Amazing! Spectacular! I never\nsaw such a thing!' Jezal grinned and bowed humbly as he went past,\nhunching his shoulders as the Crown Prince slapped him somewhat too hard\non the back. 'I always knew you'd do it! You were always my man!'\nThe Princess Terez, only daughter of the Grand Duke Orso of Talins,\nwatched Jezal pass with a tiny, disdainful smile, tapping two languid fingers\nagainst her palm in a quarter-hearted imitation of clapping. Her chin was\nraised painfully high, as though just to be looked at by her was an honour\nhe could never fully appreciate, and certainly did not deserve.\nAnd so he came at last to the high seat of Guslav the fifth, High King of\nthe Union. His head was slumped sideways, squashed down under the\nsparkling crown. His pasty pale fingers twitched on his crimson silk mantle\nlike white slugs. His eyes were closed, chest rising and falling gently,\naccompanied by gentle splutterings as spittle issued from his slack lips and\nran down his chin, joining the sweat on his bulging jowls and helping it to\nturn his high collar dark with wet.\nTruly, Jezal was in the presence of greatness.\n'Your Majesty,' murmured Lord Hoff. The head of state did not respond.\nHis wife the Queen looked on, painfully erect, a fixed, emotionless smile\nplastered across her well-powdered face.\nJezal hardly knew where to look, and settled on his dusty shoes. The\nLord Chamberlain coughed loudly. A muscle twitched beneath the sweaty\nfat on the side of the King's face, but he did not wake. Hoff winced, and,\nglancing around to make sure no one was watching too closely, jabbed the\nroyal ribs with his finger."

The senile old fool had mistaken him for his younger son. Worse\nyet, the Prince himself was standing not four paces away. The Queen's\nwooden grin twitched slightly. Princess Terez' perfect lips twisted with\nscorn. The Lord Chamberlain gave an awkward cough. 'Er, no, your\nMajesty, this is…'\nBut it was too late. Without any warning, the monarch struggled to his\nfeet and folded Jezal in an enthusiastic embrace, his heavy crown slipping\nover to one side of his head and one of its jewel-encrusted prongs nearly\npoking Jezal in the eye. Lord Hoff's jaw opened silently. The two Princes\ngoggled. Jezal could only manage a helpless gurgle.\n'My son!' blubbered the King, his voice choked with emotion. 'Raynault,\nI'm so glad you're back! When I am gone, Ladisla will need your help. He is\nso weak, and the crown is such a heavy weight! You were always the better\nsuited for it! Such a heavy weight!' he sobbed into Jezal's shoulder.\nIt was like a hideous nightmare. Ladisla and the real Raynault gawped\nat each other, then back at their father, both looking sick. Terez was\nsneering down her nose at her prospective father-in-law with undisguised\ncontempt. From bad to much, much worse. What the hell did one do in such\na situation? Could there possibly be any etiquette devised for this? Jezal\npatted his King awkwardly on his fat back. What else could he do? Shove\nthe senile old idiot over on his arse, with half of his subjects looking on? He\nwas almost tempted to do it.\nIt was a small mercy that the crowds took the King's embrace for a\nringing endorsement of Jezal's fencing abilities, and drowned out his words\nwith a fresh wave of cheering. No one beyond the royal box heard what he\nsaid. They all missed the full significance of what was, without doubt, the\nmost embarrassing moment of Jezal's life.\nThe Ideal Audience\n« ^ »\nArch Lector Sult was standing by his huge window when Glokta arrived,\ntall and imposing as always in his spotless white coat, gazing out across the\nspires of the University towards the House of the Maker. A pleasant breeze\nwas washing through the great circular room, ruffling the old man's shock\nof white hair and making the many papers on his enormous desk crackle\nand flutter.\nHe turned as Glokta shuffled into the room.

Glokta took the hand in his, and\ngrimaced as he bent down to kiss the ring, his cane trembling with the effort\nof keeping upright. Damn it if the old bastard doesn't hold his hand a little\nlower every time, just to watch me sweat.\nSult poured himself into his tall chair in one smooth motion, elbows on\nthe table top, fingers pressed together before him. Glokta could only stand\nand wait, his leg burning from the familiar climb through the House of\nQuestions, sweat tickling his scalp, and wait for the invitation to sit.\n'Please be seated,' murmured the Arch Lector, then waited while Glokta\nwinced his way into one of the lesser chairs at the round table. 'Now tell me,\nhas your investigation met with any success?'\n'Some. There was a disturbance at our visitors' chambers the other night.\nThey claim that—'\n'Plainly an attempt to add credence to this outrageous story. Magic!' Sult\nsnorted his disdain. 'Have you discovered how the breach in the wall was\nreally made?'\nMagic, perhaps? 'I am afraid not, Arch Lector.'\n'That is unfortunate. Some proof of how this particular trick was\nmanaged might be of use to us. Still,' and Sult sighed as though he had\nexpected no better, 'one cannot have everything. Did you speak to these…\npeople?'\n'I did. Bayaz, if I may use the name, is a most slippery talker. Without\nthe aid of anything more persuasive than the questions themselves, I could\nget nothing from him. His friend the Northman also bears some study.'\nOne crease formed across Sult's smooth forehead. 'You suspect some\nconnection with this savage Bethod?'\n'Possibly.'\n'Possibly?' echoed the Arch Lector sourly, as though the very word was\npoison. 'What else?'\n'There has been a new addition to the merry band.'\n'I know. The Navigator.'\nWhy do I even bother? 'Yes, your Eminence, a Navigator.'\n'Good luck to them. Those penny-pinching fortune-tellers are always\nmore trouble than they're worth. Blubbering on about God and what have\nyou. Greedy savages.'\n'Absolutely. More trouble than they're worth, Arch Lector, though it\nwould be interesting to know why they have employed one.'\n'And why have they?'\nGlokta paused for a moment. 'I don't know.'\n'Huh,' snorted Sult. 'What else?'\n'Following their night-time visitation, our friends were relocated to a\nsuite of rooms beside the park. There was a most grisly death a few nights\nago, not twenty paces from their windows.'\n'Superior Goyle mentioned this. He said it was nothing to concern\nmyself about, that there was no connection with our visitors. I left the\nmatter in his hands.' He frowned at Glokta. 'Did I make the wrong\ndecision?'\nOh dear me, I need not think too long over this one. 'Absolutely not,\nArch Lector.' Glokta bowed his head in deep respect.

So what you are telling me is that, all in all, we have nothing.'\nNot quite nothing. 'There is this.' Glokta fished the ancient scroll from\nhis coat pocket and held it out.\nSult had a look of mild curiosity on his face as he took it and unrolled it\non the table, stared down at the meaningless symbols. 'What is it?'\nHah. So you don't know everything. 'I suppose you could say that it's a\npiece of history. An account of how Bayaz defeated the Master Maker.'\n'A piece of history.' Sult tapped his finger thoughtfully on the table top.\n'And how does it help us?' How does it help you, you mean?\n'According to this, it was our friend Bayaz who sealed up the House of\nthe Maker.' Glokta nodded towards the looming shape beyond the window.\n'Sealed it up… and took the key.'\n'Key? That tower has always been sealed. Always. As far as I am aware\nthere is not even a keyhole.'\n'Those were precisely my thoughts, your Eminence.'\n'Hmm.' Slowly, Sult began to smile. 'Stories are all in how you tell\nthem, eh?

'Is it authentic?'\n'Does it matter?'\n'Of course not.' Sult rose gracefully from his chair and paced slowly\nover to the window, tapping the rolled-up scroll against his fingers. He\nstood there for some time, staring out. When he turned, he had developed a\nlook of the deepest self-satisfaction.\n'It occurs to me that there will be a feast tomorrow evening, a\ncelebration for our new champion swordsman, Captain Luthar.' That\ncheating little worm. 'The great and the good will be in attendance: the\nQueen, both Princes, most of the Closed Council, several leading\nnoblemen.' Not forgetting the King himself. It has come to something when\nhis presence at dinner is not even worth mentioning. 'That would be the\nideal audience for our little unmasking, don't you think?'\nGlokta cautiously bowed his head. 'Of course, Arch Lector. The ideal\naudience.' Providing it works. It might be an embarrassing audience to fail\nin front of.\nBut Sult was already anticipating his triumph.

Glokta bowed again. 'I would not miss it for anything, your\nEminence.'\n'Good. Bring your Practicals with you. Our friends might become\nviolent when they realise the game is up.

All those\nstairs, just for this?\nSult was looking down his nose at the scroll as Glokta finally reached\nthe threshold. 'The ideal audience,' he was muttering, as the heavy doors\nclicked shut.\nIn the North, a chieftain's own Carls ate with him every night in his hall.\nThe women brought the food in wooden bowls. You'd stab the lumps of\nmeat out with a knife and with a knife you'd cut them up, then you'd stuff\nthe bits in your mouth with your fingers. If you found some bone or gristle\nyou'd toss it down on the straw for the dogs. The table, if there was one,\nwas a few slabs of ill-fitting wood, stained and gouged and scarred from\nhaving knives stuck in it. The Carls sat on long benches, with maybe a chair\nor two for the Named Men. It'd be dark, especially in the long winters, and\nsmoky from the fire-pit and the chagga pipes. There'd often be singing of\nsongs, usually shouting of good-natured insults, sometimes screaming of\nbad-natured ones, and always a lot of drink. The only rule was that you\nwaited for the chief to begin.\nLogen had no idea what the rules might be here, but he guessed there\nwere a lot.\nThe guests were sat round three long tables set out in a horseshoe, sixty\npeople or more. Everyone had their own chair, and the dark wood of the\ntable tops was polished to a high sheen, made bright enough for Logen to\nsee the blurry outline of his face in by hundreds of candles scattered round\nthe walls and down the tables. Every guest had at least three blunt knives,\nand several other things scattered about in front of them that Logen had no\nidea of the use for, including a big flat circle of shiny metal.\nThere was no shouting and certainly no singing, just a low murmur like\na bee-hive as people muttered between themselves, leaning towards each\nother as if they were swapping secrets. The clothes were stranger than ever.\nOld men wore heavy robes of black, red and gold, trimmed with shining fur,\neven in the heat.\nYoung men wore tight fitting jackets in bright crimson, green, or blue,\nfestooned with ropes and knots of gold and silver thread. Women were hung\nwith chains and rings of glittering gold and flashing jewels, wearing strange\ndresses of vivid cloth that were ridiculously loose and billowing in places,\npainfully tight in others, and left others still entirely, distractingly bare.\nEven the servants were dressed like lords, prowling around behind the\ntables, leaning forward silently to fill goblets with sweet, thin wine. Logen\nhad already drunk a deal of it, and the bright room had taken on a pleasant\nglow.\nThe problem was the lack of food. He hadn't eaten since that morning\nand his stomach was growling. He'd been eyeing the jars of plants sat on the\ntables before the guests. They had bright flowers on them, and didn't look\nmuch like food to him, but then they ate some strange things in this country.\nThere was nothing for it but to try.

He snatched one of the things from\nthe jar, a long piece of green plant with a yellow flower on the end. He took\na nibble from the bottom of the stem. Tasteless and watery, but at least it\nwas crunchy. He took a larger bite and munched on it without relish.\n'I don't think they're meant for eating.' Logen glanced round, surprised\nto hear the Northern tongue spoken here, surprised that anyone was\nspeaking to him at all. His neighbour, a tall, gaunt man with a sharp, lined\nface, was leaning towards him with an embarrassed smile. Logen\nrecognised him vaguely. He'd been at the sword game—holding the blades\nfor the lad from the gate.\n'Ah,' mumbled Logen round his mouthful of plant. The taste of the stuff\ngot worse with time. 'Sorry,' he said once he had forced it down his throat, 'I\ndon't know much about these things.'\n'Honestly, neither do I. How did it taste?'\n'Like shit.' Logen held the half-eaten flower uncertainly in his fingers.\nThe tiled floor was spotlessly clean. It hardly seemed right to toss the thing\nunder the table. There were no dogs anyway, and even if there had been he\ndoubted they'd have eaten the thing. A dog would have had more sense than\nhim. He dropped it on the metal platter and wiped his fingers on his chest,\nhoping that no one had noticed.\n'My name is West,' said the man, offering his hand, 'I come from\nAngland.'\nLogen gave the hand a squeeze. 'Ninefingers. A Brynn, from way up\nnorth of the High Places.'\n'Ninefingers?' Logen waggled his stump at him and the man nodded.\n'Ah, I see.' He smiled as though remembering something funny. 'I heard a\nsong once, in Angland, about a nine-fingered man. What was he called\nnow? The Bloody-Nine! That was it!' Logen felt his grin slipping. 'One of\nthose Northern songs, you know the kind, all violence. He cut off heads by\nthe cartload, this Bloody-Nine, and burned towns, and mixed blood with his\nbeer and whatnot. That wasn't you, was it?'\nThe man was making a joke. Logen laughed nervously. 'No, no, I never\nheard of him,' but luckily West had already moved on.\n'Tell me, you look like you've seen some battles in your time.'\n'I've been in some scrapes.' It was pointless to deny it.\n'Do you know of this one they call the King of the Northmen? This man\nBethod?'\nLogen glanced sideways. 'I know of him.'\n'You fought against him in the wars?'\nLogen grimaced. The sour taste of the plant seemed to be lingering in\nhis mouth. He picked up his goblet and took a swallow. 'Worse,' he said\nslowly as he set it down. 'I fought for him.'\nThis only seemed to make the man more curious than ever. 'Then you\nknow about his tactics, and his troops. His way of making war?' Logen\nnodded. 'What can you tell me about him?'"

Make no mistake, I hate the man, but there's been no war leader in\nhis league since the days of Skarling Hoodless. He has that in him which\nmen respect, or fear, or at least obey. He pushes his men hard, so he can\nmake the field first and choose his own ground, but they march hard for him\nbecause he brings them victories. He's cautious when he must be, and\nfearless when he must be, but neglects no detail. He delights in every trick\nof war—in setting traps and ambushes, in mounting feints and deceptions,\nin sending sudden raids against the unwary. Look for him where you expect\nhim least, and expect him to be strongest where he seems the weakest.\nBeware him most of all when he seems to run. Most men fear him, and\nthose that don't are fools.'\nLogen picked up the flower from the plate and started snapping it into\npieces. 'His armies are grouped about the chieftains of the clans, some of\nthem strong war leaders in their own right. Most of his fighters are Thralls,\npeasants pressed into service, lightly armed with spear or bow, fast moving\nin loose groups. In the past they were ill-trained, and taken from their farms\nfor only a short time, but the wars have been raging for so long that many of\nthem have become hard fighters, and show scant mercy.'\nHe began to arrange the bits of plant, imagining they were groups of\nmen and the plate a hill. 'Each chieftain keeps Carls besides, his own\nhousehold warriors, well armed and armoured, skilled with axe and sword\nand spear, well disciplined. Some few have horses, but Bethod will keep\nthose out of sight, waiting for the best moment to charge or pursue.' He\npulled the yellow petals from the flower, and they became horsemen hidden\non the flanks. 'Last there are the Known Men, the Named Men, those\nwarriors who've earned great respect in battle. They might lead groups of\nCarls on the field, or act as scouts or raiders, sometimes far in the enemy's\nrear.'\nHe realised the plate was covered with a mess of broken pieces of plant,\nand brushed them hurriedly off onto the table. 'That's the tradition of war in\nthe North, but Bethod's always had a fancy for new ideas. He's read books,\nand studied other ways of fighting, and often talked of buying flat-bows,\nand heavy armour, and strong war-horses from the southern traders, and of\nmaking an army to be feared throughout the world.'\nLogen became aware he had been talking solidly for ages. He hadn't\nsaid half that many words together in years, but West was staring at him\nwith a look of rapt attention. 'You speak like a man who knows his\nbusiness.'\n'Well, you've happened upon the one subject on which I might be\nreckoned an expert.'\n'What advice would you give to a man who had to fight a war against\nBethod?'\nLogen frowned. 'Be careful. And watch your back.'"

At first, of course, it had seemed a\ndelightful idea, just the thing he had always dreamed of: a celebration in his\nhonour, attended by so many of the Union's greatest. Surely it was only the\nstart of his wonderful new life as a champion of the Contest.

They chattered to each other about government matters,\nabout the business of merchant houses, about issues of land, and title, and\npolitics. Fencing, and his remarkable skill at it, were scarcely mentioned.\nNo immediate promotion had been forthcoming. He simply had to sit there,\nand smile, and accept the odd lukewarm congratulation from strangers in\nsplendid clothes who barely even looked him in the eye. A wax effigy could\nhave done the same job. He had to admit, the adulation of the commoners in\nthe arena had been considerably more gratifying. At least they had sounded\nas if they meant it.\nStill, he had never before been within the palace compound, a fortress\nwithin the fortress of the Agriont where few indeed were permitted to tread.\nNow he was seated at the top table in the King's own dining hall, though\nJezal did not doubt that his Majesty took the majority of his meals propped\nup in bed, and most likely had them fed to him with a spoon.\nThere was a stage set into the wall at the far end of the room. Jezal had\nonce heard that Ostus, the child King, had jesters perform for him at every\nmeal. Morlic the Mad, by contrast, had staged executions there to go with\nhis dinner. King Casamir, it was said, had likenesses of his worst enemies\nshout insults at him from that stage while he took his breakfast every\nmorning, to keep his hatred for them fresh. The curtains were closed now,\nthough. Jezal would have to look for his entertainment elsewhere, and in\nthis regard the pickings were slim indeed.\nMarshal Varuz prattled on in his ear. He, at least, was still interested in\nfencing. Unfortunately, he talked of nothing else. 'I never saw such a thing.\nThe whole city is buzzing with it. Most remarkable bout that anyone's ever\nseen! I swear, you're better even than Sand dan Glokta used to be, and I\nnever thought to see his like again! I never dreamed you had it in you to\nfight like that, Jezal, never had the slightest inkling!'\n'Mmm,' said Jezal.\nThe Crown Prince Ladisla and his bride-to-be, Terez of Talins, made a\ndazzling couple at the top of the table, just beside the dozing King. They\nwere oblivious to all that was going on around them, but hardly in the way"

'I might be killed! Perhaps that would\nmake your Highness happy?'\n'Pray don't die on my account,' returned Terez, her Styrian accent\ndripping venom, 'but if you must, you must. I suppose I will learn to bear\nthe sorrow…'\nSomebody nearer at hand distracted Jezal by thumping on the table.\n'Damn these commoners! Damn peasantry's up in arms in Starikland! Lazy\ndogs, they refuse to work a stroke!'\n'It's these taxes,' grumbled the man's neighbour, 'these war taxes have\nthem all stirred up.

By a mob!\nNot a mile outside the city walls—'\n'We've damn well brought it on ourselves!' The speaker's face was out of\nsight but Jezal recognised him by the gold-embroidered cuffs on his gown.\nMarovia, the High Justice. 'Treat a man like a dog and sooner or later he'll\nbite you, it's a simple fact. Our role as governors, and as noblemen, is surely\nto respect and protect the common man, rather than to oppress and scorn\nhim?'\n'I wasn't talking about scorn, Lord Marovia, or oppression, just about\nthem paying what's due to us as their landlords, and for that matter their\nnatural betters.\nMarshal Varuz, meanwhile, had not let up for an instant. 'It was quite a\nthing, eh? The way you put him down, one steel against two!' The old\nsoldier swished his hand around in the air. 'The whole town's buzzing.\nYou're bound for great things now my boy, mark my words. Bound for great\nthings. I'll be damned if you don't have my seat on the Closed Council one\nday!'\nIt really was too much. Jezal had put up with the man for all those\nmonths. He had somehow imagined that if he won that would be the end of\nit, but it seemed he would be disappointed in this, as in so much else. It was\nstrange, but Jezal had never fully realised before what a boring old imbecile\nthe Lord Marshal was. He was realising now though, and no mistake.\nTo further add to his dismay, there were several people seated about the\ntables who would most definitely not have been among his chosen guests.\nHe supposed he could make a dispensation for Sult, the Arch Lector of the\nInquisition, since he sat on the Closed Council and was without doubt a\npowerful figure, but Jezal could not comprehend why he might have"

For some reason he was\noccasionally shooting grim and suspicious glances at Jezal as though he\nsuspected him of some crime or other. It was a damn cheek, what with it\nbeing his feast and all.\nEven worse, on the other side of the room was that old, bald man, the\none who had called himself Bayaz. Jezal had still not got to the bottom of\nhis strange words of congratulation at the Contest—or his father's reaction\nto the man, for that matter. And he had his hideous friend, the nine-fingered\nbarbarian, beside him.\nMajor West had the misfortune of being seated next to the primitive, but\nhe was making the best of it; indeed, the two were engaged in a lively\nconversation. The Northman broke into sudden peals of laughter and\nthumped the table with his big fist, making the glasses rattle. At least they\nwere enjoying themselves at his party, Jezal thought sourly, but he almost\nwished he was down there with them.\nStill, he knew that he wanted to be a big, important man some day. To\nwear things with a lot of fur, and a heavy golden chain of office. To have\npeople bow and scrape and fawn before him. He had made that decision\nlong ago, and he supposed he still liked the idea. It was just that, up close,\nthe whole thing seemed so awfully false and boring. He would much, much\nrather have been on his own with Ardee, even though he had seen her the\nnight before. There was nothing boring about her…\n'… the savages are closing on Ostenhorm, that's what I heard!' someone\nshouted over on Jezal's left. 'The Lord Governor, Meed, he's raising an army\nand has sworn to turn them out of Angland!'\n'Hah. Meed? That swollen-headed old fool couldn't turn a pie out of a\ndish!'\n'Enough to beat these Northern animals though, what? One good Union\nman's worth ten of their kind.\nJezal heard Terez' voice cutting suddenly shrill above the hubbub,\nalmost loud enough to be heard at the far end of the room, '… of course I\nwill marry where my father commands me, but I don't have to like it!' She\nappeared so vicious at that moment that he would not have been surprised\nto see her stab the Crown Prince in the face with her fork. Jezal felt\nsomewhat gratified to see that he was not the only one who had trouble with\nwomen.\n'… oh yes, a remarkable performance! Everyone's talking about it,'\nVaruz was still droning.\nJezal squirmed in his chair. How long was this bloody business going to\ntake? He felt suffocated. He glanced across the faces again and caught\nGlokta's eye, staring at him with that grim, suspicious look on his wasted\nface. Jezal still couldn't meet that gaze for long, his party or no.

Glokta's eyes tracked\nslowly across the table opposite until they lighted on Bayaz. The old fraud\nwas sitting there, quite at home. And he had some part in it. They cheated,\ntogether. Somehow.\n'My lords and ladies!' The chatter faded as the Lord Chamberlain rose to\naddress the room. 'I would like to welcome you all, on his Majesty's behalf,\nto this humble gathering.' The King himself stirred briefly, gazed vacantly\nabout him, blinked, then closed his eyes. 'We are gathered, of course, in\nhonour of Captain Jezal dan Luthar, who has recently added his name to\nthat most select roll of honour: those swordsman who have been victorious\nat the summer Contest.' A few glasses were raised and there were some\nhalf-hearted mumblings of agreement.\n'I recognise several other winners among the assembly here today, many\nof them now the holders of high office: Lord Marshal Varuz, Commander\nValdis of the Knights Herald, Major West down there, now on Marshal\nBurr's staff, of course. Even I was a winner in my day' He smiled and\nlooked down at his bulging paunch. 'Though my day was some time ago, of\ncourse.' A polite ripple of laughter passed round the room. I notice that I\ndon't get a mention. Not all winners are enviable, eh?\n'Victors at the Contest,' continued the Lord Chamberlain, 'have so often\ngone on to great things. I hope, and indeed we all hope, that it may prove so\nfor our young friend, Captain Luthar.' I hope he meets a slow death in\nAngland, the cheating little bastard. But Glokta raised his glass along with\neveryone else to toast the arrogant ass, while Luthar sat there, loving every\ninstant of it.\nAnd to think. I sat in that very chair, being applauded and envied and\nclapped on the back after I won the Contest. Different men in the big\nclothes, different faces sweating in the heat, but nothing very much has\nchanged. Was my grin really any less smug? Of course not. If anything I\nwas worse. But at least I earned it.\nSuch was Lord Hoffs commitment that he did not stop toasting until his\ngoblet was entirely empty, then he shoved it back on the table and licked his\nlips. 'And now, before the food arrives, a small surprise has been prepared\nby my colleague Arch Lector Sult, in honour of another of our guests. I\nhope you will all find it diverting.' And the Lord Chamberlain sat heavily\nback down, holding his empty goblet out for more wine.\nGlokta glanced across at Sult. A surprise, from the Arch Lector? Bad\nnews for somebody.\nThe heavy red curtains of the stage rolled slowly back. They revealed an\nold man lying on the boards, his white garment daubed with colourful\nblood. A broad canvas behind depicted a forest scene beneath a starry sky. It\nreminded Glokta rather unpleasantly of the mural in the round room. The\nroom beneath Severard's crumbling pile by the docks."

The\nroom beneath Severard's crumbling pile by the docks.\nA second old man swept on from the wings: a tall, slender man with\nremarkably fine, sharp features. His head was shaved bald and he had\ngrown a short white beard, but Glokta recognised him immediately. Iosiv\nLestek, one of the city's most respected actors. He gave a mannered start as\nhe noticed the bloody corpse.\n'Oooooooh!' he wailed, spreading his arms wide in an actor's\napproximation of shock and despair. It was a truly enormous voice, loud\nenough to make the rafters shake. Confident that he had the undivided\nattention of the chamber, Lestek began to intone his lines, hands sweeping\nthrough the air, towering passions sweeping across his face.\nSo here, at last, my master Juvens lies,\nAnd with his death all hope of peace now dies,\nBy Kanedias' treachery undone.\nHis passing is the setting of the sun\nUpon an age.\nThe old actor threw back his head, and Glokta saw tears sparkling in his\neyes. A neat trick, to cry on demand like that. A lonely drop trickled slowly\ndown his cheek, and the audience sat spellbound. He turned once again to\nthe body.\nHere brother murders brother. All slow time\nCan never have recorded such a crime.\nI half expect to see the stars go out.\nWhy does the ground not open up and spout\nSome raging flame?\nHe threw himself down on his knees and beat upon his ageing breast.\nOh bitter fate, I would most happily\nNow join my master, but it cannot be!\nFor when a great man dies, we that remain\nThough in a narrowed world, must brave the pain\nAnd struggle onward.\nLestek looked slowly up towards the audience, slowly clambered to his\nfeet, his expression shifting from deepest sorrow to grimmest\ndetermination.\nFor though the Maker's house is locked and barred,\nAll carved from rock and steel, all wondrous hard,\nIf I must wait until that steel is rust,\nOr with my bare hands crush that rock to dust,\nI'll have my vengeance!\nThe actor's eyes flashed fire as he flicked out his robe and strode from\nthe stage to rapturous applause. It was a condensed version of a familiar\npiece, often performed. Although rarely so well. Glokta was surprised to\nfind himself clapping. Quite the performance so far. Nobility, passion,\ncommand. A great deal more convincing than another fake Bayaz I could\nmention. He sat back in his chair, easing his left leg out under the table, and\nprepared to enjoy the show.\nLogen watched with his face screwed up in confusion. He guessed that this\nwas one of the spectacles that Bayaz had spoken of, but his grip on the\nlanguage wasn't good enough to catch the details.\nThey swept up and down the stage with much sighing and waving of\ntheir hands, dressed in bright costumes and speaking in some kind of chant.\nTwo of them were supposed to be dark-skinned, he thought, but were\nclearly pale men with black paint on their faces.

In another scene, the one\nplaying Bayaz whispered to a woman through a door, seeming to plead with\nher to open it, only the door was a piece of painted wood stood up on its\nown in the middle of the stage, and the woman was a boy in a dress. It\nwould have been easier, Logen thought, to step around the piece of wood\nand speak to him or her directly.\nLogen was sure of one thing, though—the real Bayaz was seriously\ndispleased. He could feel his annoyance mounting with each scene. It\nreached a teeth-grinding peak when the villain of the piece, a big man with\na glove and an eye-patch, pushed the boy in the dress over some wooden\nbattlements. It was plain that he or she was meant to have fallen a great\ndistance, even though Logen could hear him hit something soft just behind\nthe stage.\n'How fucking dare they?' the real Bayaz growled under his breath.\nLogen would have got all the way out of the room if he could've, but he had\nto be content with shuffling his chair towards West, as far from the Magus'\nfury as possible.\nOn the stage, the other Bayaz was battling the old man with the glove\nand the eye-patch, although they fought by walking round in circles and\ntalking a lot. Finally the villain followed the boy off the back of the stage,\nbut not before his adversary took an enormous golden key from him.\n'There's more detail here than in the original,' muttered the real Bayaz,\nas his counterpart held up the key and spouted some more verse. Logen was\nlittle further on when the performance came to a close, but he caught the\nlast two lines, just before the old actor bowed low:\nPray your indulgence, at our story's end,\nOur humble purpose was not to offend.\n'My fucking old arse it wasn't,' hissed Bayaz through gritted teeth, while\nfixing a grin and clapping enthusiastically.\nGlokta watched Lestek take a few last bows as the curtains closed on him,\nthe golden key still shining in his hand. Arch Lector Sult rose from his chair\nas the applause died.\n'I am so glad you enjoyed our little diversion,' he said, smiling smoothly\nround at the appreciative gathering. 'I do not doubt that many of you have\nseen this piece before, but it has a special significance this evening. Captain\nLuthar is not the only celebrated figure in our midst, there is a second guest\nof honour here tonight. None other than the subject of our play—Bayaz\nhimself, the First of the Magi!' Sult smiled and held out his arm towards the\nold fake on the other side of the room. There was a gentle rustling as every\nguest turned from the Arch Lector to look at him.\nBayaz smiled back. 'Good evening,' he said. A few of the worthies\nlaughed, suspecting some further little game perhaps, but Sult did not laugh\nwith them and their merriment was short lived.

He has been with us in the Agriont now for\nseveral weeks. He and a few… companions.' Sult glanced down his nose at\nthe scarred Northman, and then back to the self-styled Magus. 'Bayaz.' He\nrolled the word around his mouth, allowing it to sink into his listeners' ears.\n'The first letter in the alphabet of the old tongue. First apprentice of Juvens,\nfirst letter of the alphabet, is that not so, Master Bayaz?'\n'Why, Arch Lector,' asked the old man, still smirking, 'have you been\nchecking up on me?' Impressive. Even now, when he must sense the game\nwill soon be over, he sticks to his role.\nSult was unmoved however. 'It is my duty thoroughly to investigate\nanyone who might pose a threat to my King or country,' he intoned stiffly.\n'How fearsomely patriotic of you. Your investigations no doubt revealed\nthat I am still a member of the Closed Council, even if my chair stands\nempty for the time being. I believe Lord Bayaz would be the proper term of\naddress.'\nSult's cold smile did not slip even a hair's breath. 'And when exactly was\nyour last visit, Lord Bayaz? It would seem that someone so deeply involved\nin our history would have taken more of an interest over the years. Why, if I\nmay ask, in the centuries since the birth of the Union, since the time of\nHarod the Great, have you not been back to visit us?' A good question. I\nwish it had occurred to me.\n'Oh, but I have been. During the reign of King Morlic the Mad, and in\nthe civil war which followed, I was tutor to a young man called Arnault.\nLater, when Morlic was murdered and Arnault was raised to the throne by\nthe Open Council, I served as his Lord Chamberlain. I called myself\nBialoveld in those days. I visited again in King Casamir's reign. He called\nme Zoller, and I had your job, Arch Lector.'\nGlokta could barely contain a gasp of indignation, and heard others\nfrom the chairs around him. He has no shame, I'll give him that. Bialoveld,\nand Zoller, two of the Unions most respected servants. How dare he? And\nyet… He pictured the painting of Zoller in the Arch Lectors study, and the\nstatue of Bialoveld in the Kingsway. Both bald, both stern, both bearded…\nbut what am I thinking? Major West is thinning out on top. Does that make\nhim a legendary wizard? Most likely this charlatan merely picked the two\nbaldest figures he could find.\nSult, meanwhile, was trying a different tack. 'Tell me this, then, Bayaz:\nit is a story well known that Harod himself doubted you when you first\ncame to his hall, all those long years ago. As proof of your power, you\nbroke his long table in two. It may be that there are some sceptics among us\nhere tonight. Would you consider such a demonstration for us, now?'"

'What you speak of\nis not juggling, Arch Lector, or playing on the stage. There are always\ndangers, and costs. Besides, it would be a great shame to spoil Captain\nLuthar's feast simply so I could show off, don't you think? Not to mention\nthe waste of a fine old piece of furniture. I, unlike so many others these\ndays, have a healthy respect for the past.'\nSome were smiling uncertainly as they watched the two old men\nfencing with each other, perhaps still suspecting an elaborate joke. Others\nknew better and were frowning hard, trying to work out what was going on,\nand who had the upper hand. High Justice Marovia, Glokta noticed, looked\nto be thoroughly enjoying himself. Almost as if he knows something we\ndon't. Glokta shifted uncomfortably in his chair, eyes fixed on the bald\nactor. Things are not going as well as they should be. When will he begin to\nsweat? When?\nSomeone placed a bowl of steaming soup in front of Logen. No doubt it\nwas meant to be eaten, but now his appetite was gone. Logen might be no\ncourtier, but he could spot folk working up to violence when he saw them.\nWith each exchange between the two old men their smiles slipped further,\ntheir voices became harder, the hall seemed to grow closer and more\noppressive. Everyone in the room was looking worried now—West, the\nproud lad who'd won that sword game because of Bayaz' cheating, the\nfeverish cripple who'd asked all the questions…\nLogen felt the hairs on his neck rising. There were two figures lurking\nin the nearest doorway. Black-clothed figures, black-masked. His eyes\nflicked across to the other entrances. Each held two of those masked\nfigures, two at least, and he didn't reckon they were here to collect the\nplates.\nThey were here for him. For him and Bayaz, he could feel it. A man\ndoesn't put on a mask unless he's got some dark work in mind. There was\nno way that he could deal with half that many, but he slid a knife from\nbeside his plate and hid it behind his arm anyway. If they tried to take him,\nhe'd fight. That didn't need thinking about.\nBayaz was starting to sound angry. 'I have supplied you with all the\nproofs you've asked for, Arch Lector!'\n'Proofs!' The tall man they called Sult gave a cold sneer. 'You deal in\nwords and dusty papers! More the business of a snivelling clerk than the\nstuff of legend! Some would say that a Magus without magic is simply a\nmeddling old man! We are at war, and can take no chances! You mentioned\nArch Lector Zoller. His diligence in the cause of truth is well documented.\nYou, I am sure, must understand mine.' He leaned forward, planting his fists\nfirmly on the table before him. 'Show us magic, Bayaz, or show us the key!'"

Bayaz reached into his collar. He took hold of something\nthere, and drew it out—a long, thin chain. One of the black-masked figures\nstepped forward a pace, expecting a weapon, and Logen's hand gripped\ntighter on the handle of the knife, but when the chain came all the way out\nthere was only a rod of dark metal dangling on the end of it.\n'The key,' said Bayaz, holding it up to the candlelight. It barely shone at\nall. 'Less lustre than the one in your play, perhaps, but the real thing, I\nassure you. Kanedias never worked with gold. He did not like pretty things.\nHe liked things that worked.'\nThe Arch Lector's lip curled. 'Do you simply expect us to take your\nword for it?'\n'Of course not. It is your job to be suspicious of everyone, and I must\nsay you do it exceptionally well. It does grow rather late however, so I will\nwait until tomorrow morning to open the House of the Maker.' Someone\ndropped a spoon on the floor, and it clattered against the tiles. 'There will\nneed to be some witnesses present, of course, to make sure that I don't try\nany sleight of hand. How about…' Bayaz' cool green eyes swept down the\ntable. 'Inquisitor Glokta, and… your new fencing champion, Captain\nLuthar?'\nThe cripple frowned as he was named. Luthar looked utterly\nbewildered. The Arch Lector sat, his scorn swapped for a stony blankness.\nHe gazed from Bayaz' smiling face to that gently swinging rod of dark\nmetal, then back again. His eyes moved over to one of the doorways, and he\ngive a tiny shake of his head. The dark figures faded back into the shadows.\nLogen unclenched his aching teeth, then quietly slipped the knife back on to\nthe table.\nBayaz grinned. 'Dear me, Master Sult, you really are a hard man to\nplease.'\n'I believe your Eminence is the proper term of address,' hissed the Arch\nLector.\n'So it is, so it is. I do declare, you really won't be happy until I've broken\nsome furniture. I would hate to spill everyone's soup though, so…' With a\nsudden bang, the Arch Lector's chair collapsed.

Every bit as much at ease as a grandfather with his\nfavourite grandson, and every bit as boring. '… of course, the city is so\nmuch larger than when I last visited. That district you call the Three Farms,\nall teeming bustle and activity. I remember when that whole borough was\nthree farms! Indeed I do! And far beyond the city walls!'\n'Erm…' said Luthar.\n'And as for the Spicers' new guildhall, I never saw such ostentation…'\nGlokta's mind raced as he limped after the two of them, trawling for\nhidden meanings in the sea of blather, grasping for order in the chaos. The\nquestions tumbled over each other. Why pick me as a witness? Why not the\nArch Lector himself? Does this Bayaz suppose that I can be easily fooled?\nAnd why Luthar? Because he won the Contest? And how did he win? Is he\napart of this deception? But if Luthar was party to some sinister plan, he\nwas giving no sign. Glokta had never seen the slightest hint that he was\nanything other than the self-obsessed young fool he appeared to be.\nAnd then we come to this puzzle. Glokta glanced sidelong at the big\nNorthman. There were no signs of deadly intent on his scarred face, little\nsign that anything was going on in there at all. Is he very stupid or very\nclever? Is he to be ignored, or feared? Is he the servant, or the master?\nThere were no answers to any of it. Yet."

Yet.\n'Well, this place is a shadow of its former self,' said Bayaz as they halted\noutside the door to the University, raising an eyebrow at the grimy, tilting\nstatues. He rapped briskly on the weathered wood and the door swayed on\nits hinges. To Glokta's surprise, it opened almost immediately.\n'You're expected,' croaked the ancient porter. They stepped around him\ninto the gloom. 'I will show you to—' began the old man as he wrestled the\ncreaking door shut.\n'No need,' called Bayaz over his shoulder, already striding briskly off\ndown the dusty corridor, 'I know the way!' Glokta struggled to keep up,\nsweating despite the cold weather, leg burning all the way. The effort of\nmaintaining the pace scarcely gave him time to consider how the bald\nbastard might be so familiar with the building. But familiar he certainly is.\nHe swept down the corridors as though he had spent every day of his life\nthere, clicking his tongue in disgust at the state of the place and prattling all\nthe while.\n'… I've never seen such dust, eh, Captain Luthar? I wouldn't be\nsurprised if the damn place hadn't been cleaned since I was last here! I've no\nidea how a man can think under such conditions! No idea at all…' Centuries\nof dead and justly forgotten Adepti stared gloomily down from their\ncanvases, as though upset by all the noise.\nThe corridors of the University rolled past, an ancient, dusty, forsaken-\nseeming place, with nothing in it but grimy old paintings and musty old\nbooks. Jezal had precious little use for books.\nHe had read a few about fencing and riding, a couple about famous\nmilitary campaigns, once opened the covers on a great big history of the\nUnion he found in his father's study, and got bored after three or four pages.\nBayaz droned on. 'Here we fought with the Maker's servants. I\nremember it well. They cried out to Kanedias to save them, but he would\nnot come down. These halls ran with blood, rang with screams, rolled with\nsmoke that day.'\nJezal had no idea why the old fool would single him out to tell his tall\nstories to, and still less how to reply. 'That sounds… violent.'\nBayaz nodded. 'It was. I am not proud of it. But good men must\nsometimes do violent things.'\n'Uh,' said the Northman suddenly. Jezal had not been aware that he was\neven listening.\n'Besides, that was a different age. A violent age. Only in the Old Empire\nwere people advanced beyond the primitive. Midderland, the heart of the\nUnion, believe it or not, was a sty. A wasteland of warring, barbaric tribes.\nThe luckiest among them were taken into the Maker's service. The rest were\npainted-face savages, without writing, without science, with barely anything\nto separate them from the beasts.'\nJezal glanced furtively up at Ninefingers.

It was not at all difficult to\npicture a barbaric state with that big brute beside him, but it was ridiculous\nto suppose that his beautiful home had once been a wasteland, that he was\ndescended from primitives. This bald old man was a blathering liar, or a\nmadman, but some important people seemed to take him seriously.\nAnd Jezal thought it best always to do what the important people said.\nLogen followed the others into a broken-down courtyard, bounded on three\nsides by the crumbling buildings of the University, on the fourth by the\ninner face of the sheer wall of the Agriont. All was covered in old moss,\nthick ivy, dry brambles. A man sat on a rickety chair among the weeds,\nwatching them come closer.\n'I've been expecting you,' he said, pushing himself up with some\ndifficulty. 'Damn knees, I'm not what I used to be.' An unremarkable man\npast middle-age, in a threadbare shirt with stains down the front.\nBayaz frowned at him. 'You are the Chief Warden?'\n'I am.'\n'And where are the rest of your company?'\n'My wife is getting the breakfast ready, but not counting her, well, I am\nthe whole company. It's eggs,' he said happily, patting his stomach.\n'What?'\n'For breakfast. I like eggs.'\n'Good for you,' muttered Bayaz, looking slightly put out. 'In King\nCasamir's reign, the bravest fifty men of the Bang's Own were appointed\nWardens of the House, to guard this gate. There was considered to be no\nhigher honour.'\n'That was a long time ago,' said the one and only Warden, plucking at\nhis dirty shirt. 'There were nine of us when I was a lad, but they went on to\nother things, or died, and were never replaced. Don't know who'll take over\nwhen I'm gone. There haven't been too many applicants.'\n'You surprise me.' Bayaz cleared his throat. 'Oh, Chief Warden! I,\nBayaz, First of the Magi, seek your leave to pass up the stair to the fifth\ngate, beyond the fifth gate and onto the bridge, across the bridge and to the\ndoor of the Maker's House.'\nThe Chief Warden squinted back. 'You sure?'\nBayaz was growing impatient. 'Yes, why?'\n'I remember the last fellow who tried it, way back when I was a lad.\nSome big man, I reckon, some thinker. He went up those steps with ten\nstrong workmen, chisels and hammers and picks and what-have-you, telling\nus how he was going to open up the House, bring out its treasures and all.\nFive minutes and they were back, saying nothing, looking like they saw the\ndead walk.'\n'What happened?' murmured Luthar.\n'Don't know, but they had no treasures with them, I can tell you that.'\n'Without doubt a daunting story,' said Bayaz, 'but we're going.'\n'Your business, I suppose.' And the old man turned and slouched across\nthe miserable courtyard. Up a narrow stair they went, the steps worn down"

Up a narrow stair they went, the steps worn down\nin the middle, up to a tunnel through the high wall of the Agriont, on to a\nnarrow gate in the darkness.\nLogen felt an odd sense of worry as the bolts slid back. He shrugged his\nshoulders, trying to get rid of it, and the Warden grinned at him. 'You can\nfeel it already, eh?'\n'Feel what?'\n'The Maker's breath, they call it.' He gave the doors the gentlest shove.\nThey swung open together, light spilling through into the darkness. 'The\nMaker's breath.'\nGlokta tottered across the bridge, teeth clenched tight on gums, painfully\naware of the volume of empty air beneath his feet. It was a single, delicate\narch, leaping from high up on the wall of the Agriont to the gate of the\nMaker's House. He had often admired it from down in the city, on the other\nside of the lake, wondering how it had stayed up all these years. A\nspectacular, remarkable, beautiful thing. It does not seem so beautiful now.\nNot much wider than a man lying down, too narrow by far for comfort, and\nwith a terrifying drop to the water below. Worse still, it had no parapet. Not\nso much as a wooden handrail. And the breeze is rather fresh today.\nLuthar and Ninefingers seemed worried enough by it. And they have the\nfree and painless use of both their legs. Only Bayaz made the long trip\nacross without apparent worry, as confident as if his feet were on a country\nlane.\nThey walked always in the vast shadow of the House of the Maker, of\ncourse. The closer they came, the more massive it seemed, its lowest\nparapet far higher than the wall of the Agriont. A stark black mountain,\nrising sheer from the lake below, blotting out the sun. A thing from a\ndifferent age, built on a different scale.\nGlokta glanced back towards the gate behind him. Did he catch a\nglimpse of something between the battlements on the wall above? A\nPractical watching? They would see the old man fail to open the door. They\nwould be waiting to take him on their way back through. But until then, I\nam helpless. It was not a comforting thought.\nAnd Glokta was in need of comfort. As he tottered further across the\nbridge, a niggling fear swelled inside him. It was more than the height,\nmore than the strange company, more than the great tower looming above.\nA base fear, without reason. The animal terror of a nightmare. With every\nshuffling step the feeling grew. He could see the door now, a square of dark\nmetal set back into the smooth stones of the tower. A circle of letters was\netched into the centre of it. For some reason they made Glokta want to\nvomit, but he dragged himself closer. Two circles: large letters and small\nletters, a spidery script he did not recognise. His guts churned. Many\ncircles: letters and lines, too detailed to take in. They swam before his\nstinging, weeping eyes. Glokta could go no further. He stood there, leaning"

He stood there, leaning\non his cane, fighting with every ounce of will against the need to fall to his\nknees, turn and crawl away.\nNinefingers was faring little better, breathing hard through his nose, a\nlook of the most profound horror and disgust on his face. Luthar was in\nconsiderably worse shape: teeth gritted, white-faced and palsied. He\ndropped slowly down on one knee, gasping, as Glokta edged past him.\nBayaz did not seem afraid. He stepped right up to the door and ran his\nfingers over the larger symbols. 'Eleven wards, and eleven wards reversed.'\nHe traced the circle of smaller characters. 'And eleven times eleven.' His\nfinger followed the fine line outside them. Can it be that line is made of tiny\nletters too? 'Who can say how many hundreds here? Truly, a most potent\nenchantment!'\nThe sense of awe was only slightly diminished by the sound of Luthar\npuking noisily over the side of the bridge. 'What does it say?' croaked\nGlokta, swallowing some bile of his own.\nThe old man grinned at him. 'Can you not feel it, Inquisitor? It says turn\naway. It says get you gone. It says… none… shall… pass. But the message\nis not for us.' He reached into his collar and pulled out the rod of metal. The\nsame dark metal as the door itself.\n'We shouldn't be here,' growled Ninefingers from behind. 'This place is\ndead. We should go.' But Bayaz did not seem to hear.\n'The magic has leaked out of the world,' Glokta heard him murmuring,\n'and all the achievements of Juvens lie in ruins.' He weighed the key in his\nhand, brought it slowly upwards. 'But the Maker's works stand strong as\never. Time has not diminished them… nor ever will.' There did not even\nseem to be a hole, but the key slid slowly into the door. Slowly, slowly, into\nthe very centre of the circles. Glokta held his breath.\nClick.\nAnd nothing happened. The door did not open. That is all then. The\ngame is over. He felt a surge of relief as he turned back towards the\nAgriont, raising a hand to signal to the Practicals on the wall above. I need\nnot go further. I need not. Then an answering echo came from deep within.\nClick.\nGlokta felt his face twitch in sympathy with the sound. Did I imagine it?\nHe hoped so, with all his being.\nClick.\nAgain. No mistake. And now, before his disbelieving eyes, the circles in\nthe door began to turn. Glokta took a stunned step back, his cane scraping\non the stones of the bridge.\nClick, click.\nThere had been no sign that the metal was not all one piece, no cracks,\nno grooves, no mechanism, and yet the circles span, each at a different\nspeed.\nClick, click, click…\nFaster now, and faster.

The outermost, the thinnest one, was\nflying round too fast for his eyes to follow… click, click, click, click,\nclick…\nShapes formed in the markings as the symbols passed each other: lines,\nsquares, triangles, unimaginably intricate, dancing before his eyes then\nvanishing as the wheels spun on…\nClick.\nAnd the circles were still, arranged in a new pattern. Bayaz reached up\nand pulled the key from the door. There was a soft hissing, barely audible,\nas of water far away, and a long crack appeared in the door. The two halves\nmoved slowly, smoothly away from each other. The space between them\ngrew steadily larger.\nClick.\nThey slid into the walls, flush with the sides of the square archway. The\ndoor stood open.\n'Now that,' said Bayaz softly, 'is craftsmanship.'\nNo fetid wind spilled out, no stench of rot or decay, no sign of long\nyears passed, only a waft of cool, dry air. And yet the feeling is of opening a\ncoffin.\nSilence, but for the wind fumbling across the dark stones, the breath\nsighing in Glokta's dry throat, the distant lapping of the water far below.\nThe unearthly terror was gone. He felt only a deep worry as he stared into\nthe open archway. But no worse than when I wait outside the Arch Lector's\noffice. Bayaz turned round, smiling.\n'Long years have passed since I sealed this place, and in all that slow\ntime no man has crossed the threshold. You three are truly honoured.'\nGlokta did not feel honoured. He felt ill. 'There are dangers within. Touch\nnothing, and go only where I lead you. Follow close behind me, for the\nways are not always the same.'\n'Not the same?' asked Glokta. 'How can that be?'\nThe old man shrugged. 'I am only the doorman,' he said as he slipped\nthe key and its chain back inside his shirt, 'not the architect.' And he stepped\ninto the shadows.\nJezal did not feel well, not well at all. It was not simply the vile nausea that\nthe letters on the doors had somehow created, it was more. A lurch of\nsudden shock and disgust, like picking up a cup and drinking, expecting\nwater, and finding something else inside. Piss perhaps, in this case. That\nsame wave of ugly surprise, but stretching out over minutes, over hours.\nThings that he had dismissed as foolishness, or old stories, were suddenly\nrevealed as facts before his eyes. The world was a different place than it had\nbeen the day before, a weird and unsettling place, and he had infinitely\npreferred it the way it was.\nHe could not understand why he had to be here. Jezal knew precious\nlittle about history. Kanedias, Juvens, Bayaz even, they were names from\ndusty books, heard as a child and holding no interest even then. It was just\nbad luck, bad luck was all. He had won the Contest, and here he was,\nwandering about in some strange old tower. That was all it was. A strange\nold tower."

A strange\nold tower.\n'Welcome,' said Bayaz, 'to the House of the Maker.'\nJezal looked up from the floor and his jaw sagged open. The word\n'house' did little to describe the vastness of the dim space in which he found\nhimself. The Lords' Round itself could have fitted comfortably inside it, the\nentire building, with room to spare. The walls were made from rough\nstones, unfinished, unmortared, piled haphazardly, but rising endlessly\nupward, upward. Above the centre of the room, far above, something was\nsuspended. A huge, fascinating something.\nIt put Jezal in mind of a navigator's instruments, rendered on an\nenormous scale. A system of gigantic metal rings, shining in the dim light,\none about the other, with further, smaller rings running between them,\ninside them, around them. Hundreds of them perhaps, all told, scored with\nmarkings: writing maybe, or meaningless scratches. A large black ball hung\nin the centre.\nBayaz was already walking out into the vast circle of the floor, covered\nin intricate lines, set into the dark stone in bright metal, his footfalls echoing\nhigh above. Jezal crept after him. There was something frightening,\nsomething dizzying, about moving across a space so huge.\n'This is Midderland,' said Bayaz.\n'What?'\nThe old man pointed down. The squiggly lines of metal began to take on\nmeaning. Coastlines, mountains, rivers, the land and the sea. The shape of\nMidderland, clear in Jezal's mind from a hundred maps, was laid out\nbeneath his feet.\n'The whole Circle of the World.' Bayaz gestured across the endless floor.\n'That way is Angland, and beyond, the North. Gurkhul is over there. There\nis Starikland, and the Old Empire, and over here the City States of Styria,\nbeyond them Suljuk and distant Thond. Kanedias observed that the lands of\nthe known World form a circle, with its centre here, at his House, and its\nouter edge passing through the island of Shabulyan, far to the west, beyond\nthe Old Empire.'\n'The edge of the World,' muttered the Northman, nodding slowly to\nhimself.\n'Some arrogance,' snorted Glokta, 'to think of your home as the centre of\neverything.'\n'Huh.' Bayaz looked about him at the vastness of the chamber. 'The\nMaker was never short on arrogance. Nor were his brothers.'\nJezal stared up gormlessly. The room was even higher than it was wide,\nits ceiling, if there was one, lost in shadow. An iron rail ran round the rough\nstone walls, a gallery perhaps twenty strides above. Beyond it, higher still,\nthere was another, and another, and another, vague in the half light. Over all\nhung the strange device.\nHe gave a sudden start. It was moving! It was all moving!

Somehow, the key turning in the\nlock must have set it off… or could it have been turning all these years?\nHe felt dizzy. The whole mechanism now seemed to be spinning,\nrevolving, faster and faster, the galleries too, shirting in opposite directions.\nStaring straight upwards was not helping with his sense of disorientation,\nand he fixed his aching eyes on the floor, on the map of Midderland beneath\nhis feet. He gasped. That was even worse! Now the whole floor seemed to\nbe turning! The entire chamber was revolving around him! The archways\nleading out were all identical, a dozen of them or more. He could not guess\nnow through which one they had entered. He felt a wave of horrible panic.\nOnly that distant black orb in the centre of the device was still. He fixed his\nwatering eyes desperately on that, forced himself to breathe slow.\nThe feeling faded. The vast hall was still again, almost. The rings were\nstill shifting, almost imperceptibly, inching ever onwards. He swallowed a\nmouthful of spit, hunched his shoulders, and hurried after the others with\nhis head down.\n'Not that way!' roared Bayaz suddenly, his voice exploding in the thick\nsilence, ripping out and bouncing back, echoing a thousand times around\nthe cavernous space.\n'Not that way!'\n'Not that way!'\nJezal jumped backwards. The archway, and the dim hall beyond, looked\nidentical to the one down which the others had been walking, but he saw\nnow that they were off to his right. He had got turned around somehow.\n'Go only where I go, I said!' hissed the old man.\n'Not that way.'\n'Not that way.'\n'I'm sorry,' stammered Jezal, his voice sounding pitifully small in the\nvast space, 'I thought… it all looks the same!'\nBayaz placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder and drew him smoothly\naway. 'I did not mean to scare you, my friend, but it would be a great shame\nif one so promising were taken from us quite so young.' Jezal swallowed\nand stared into the shadowy hallway, wondering what might have awaited\nhim down there. His mind provided any number of unpleasant possibilities.\nThe echoes still whispered at him as he turned away. '… not that way,\nnot that way, not that way…'\nLogen hated this place. The stones were cold and dead, the air was still and\ndead, even the sounds they made as they moved fell muffled and lifeless. It\nwasn't cold and it wasn't hot, and yet his back trickled with sweat, his neck\nprickled with aimless fear. He'd jerk around every few steps, stung by the\nsudden feeling he was being watched, but there was never anyone behind\nhim. Only the boy Luthar and the cripple Glokta, looking every bit as\nworried and confused as he was.\n'We chased him through these very halls,' murmured Bayaz quietly.\n'Eleven of us.

On\none side sheer stones rose smooth, on the other they dropped away and\nwere lost in the darkness. A black pit, full of shadows, with no far side, no\ntop, no bottom. Despite the vastness of the space there were no echoes. No\nair moved. There was not the tiniest breeze. The air was stale and close as a\ntomb.\n'There should be water down there, surely,' muttered Glokta, frowning\nover the rail. 'There should be something, shouldn't there?' He squinted up.\n'Where's the ceiling?'\n'This place stinks,' whined Luthar, one hand clasped over his nose.\nLogen agreed with him, for once. It was a smell he knew well, and his\nlips curled back with hatred at it. 'Smells like fucking Flatheads.'\n'Oh yes,' said Bayaz, 'the Shanka are the Maker's work also.'\n'His work?'\n'Indeed. He took clay, and metal, and left-over flesh and he made them.'\nLogen stared. 'He made them?'\n'To fight in his war. Against us. Against the Magi. Against his brother\nJuvens. He bred the first Shanka here and let them loose upon the world—\nto grow, and breed, and destroy. That was their purpose. For many years\nafter Kanedias' death we hunted them, but we could not catch them all. We\ndrove them into the darkest corners of the world, and there they have grown\nand bred again, and now come forth to grow, and breed, and destroy, as they\nwere always meant to do.' Logen gawped at him.\n'Shanka.' Luthar chuckled and shook his head.\nFlatheads were no laughing matter. Logen turned suddenly, blocking the\nnarrow balcony with his body, looming over Luthar in the half light.\n'Something funny?'\n'Well, I mean, everyone knows there's no such thing.'\n'I've fought them with my own hands,' growled Logen, 'all my life. They\nkilled my wife, my children, my friends. The North is swarming with\nfucking Flatheads.' He leaned down. 'So don't tell me there's no such thing.'\nLuthar had turned pale. He looked to Glokta for support, but the\nInquisitor had sagged against the wall, rubbing at his leg, thin lips tight\nshut, hollow face beaded with sweat. 'I don't care a shit either way!' he\nsnapped.\n'There's plenty of Shanka in the world,' hissed Logen, sticking his face\nright up close to Luthar's. 'Maybe one day you'll meet some.' He turned and\nstalked off after Bayaz, already disappearing through an archway at the far\nend of the balcony. He had no wish to be left behind in this place."

An enormous one, lined with a silent forest of columns on\neither side, peopled with a multitude of shadows. Light cut down in shafts\nfrom far above, etching strange patterns into the stone floor, shapes of light\nand dark, lines of black and white. Almost like writing. Is there a message\nhere? For me? Glokta was trembling. If I looked, just for a moment longer,\nperhaps I could understand…\nLuthar wandered past, his shadow fell across the floor, the lines were\nbroken, the feeling was gone. Glokta shook himself. I am losing my reason\nin this cursed place. I must think clearly. Just the facts, Glokta, only the\nfacts.\n'Where does the light come from?' he asked.\nBayaz waved his hand. 'Above.'\n'There are windows?'\n'Perhaps.'\nGlokta's cane tapped into the light, tapped into the dark, his left boot\ndragged along behind. 'Is there nothing but hallway? What's the point of it\nall?'\n'Who can know the Maker's mind?' intoned Bayaz pompously, 'or\nfathom his great design?' He seemed almost to take pride in never giving\nstraight answers.\nThe whole place was a colossal waste of effort as far as Glokta could\nsee. 'How many lived here?'\n'Long years ago, in happier times, many hundreds. All manner of people\nwho served Kanedias, and helped him in his works. But the Maker was ever\ndistrustful, and jealous of his secrets. Bit by bit he turned his followers out,\ninto the Agriont, the University. Towards the end, only three lived here.\nKanedias himself, his assistant Jaremias,' Bayaz paused for a moment, 'and\nhis daughter Tolomei.'\n'The Makers daughter?'\n'What of it?' snapped the old man.\n'Nothing, nothing at all.' And yet the veneer slipped then, if only for an\ninstant. It is strange that he knows the ways of this place so well. 'When did\nyou live here?'\nBayaz frowned deep. 'There is such a thing as too many questions.'\nGlokta watched him walk away. Sult was wrong. The Arch Lector,\nfallible after all. He underestimated this Bayaz, and it cost him. Who is this\nbald, irritable fool, who can make a sprawling idiot of the most powerful\nman in the Union? Standing here, deep within the bowels of this unearthly\nplace, the answer did not seem so strange.\nThe First of the Magi.\n'This is it.'\n'What?' asked Logen. The hallway stretched out in either direction,\ncurving gently, disappearing into the darkness, walls of huge stone blocks,\nunbroken on either side.\nBayaz did not answer.

A glimmer of light shone down a narrow\npassageway, a rushing sound washed through like the trickling of a stream.\nLogen felt a strange curiosity picking at him. He glanced back at the other\ntwo. Perhaps Bayaz had meant only for them to stay? He ducked through\nthe doorway.\nAnd squinted up at a bright, round chamber. Light flooded in from high\nabove, piercing light, almost painful to look at after the gloom of all the\nrest. The curving walls were perfect, clean white stone, running with\ntrickling water, flowing down all around and collecting in a round pool\nbelow. The air was cool, damp on Logen's skin. A narrow bridge sprang out\nfrom the passage, steps leading upwards, ending at a tall white pillar, rising\nfrom the water. Bayaz was standing there, on top of it, staring down at\nsomething.\nLogen crept up behind the Magus, breathing shallow. A block of white\nstone stood there. Water dripped onto its smooth, hard centre from above. A\nregular tap, tap, tap, always in the same spot. Two things lay in the thin\nlayer of wet. The first was a square box, simply made from dark metal, big\nenough to hold a man's head, maybe. The other was altogether stranger.\nA weapon perhaps, like an axe. A long shaft, made from tiny metal\ntubes, all twisted about each other like the stems of old vines. At one end\nthere was a scored grip, at the other there was a flat piece of metal, pierced\nwith small holes, a long, thin hook curving out from it. The light played\nover its many dark surfaces, glittering with beads of moisture. Strange,\nbeautiful, fascinating. On the grip one letter glinted, silver in the dark metal.\nLogen recognised it from his sword. The mark of Kanedias. The work of\nthe Master Maker.\n'What is this?' he asked, reaching out for it.\n'Don't touch it!' screamed Bayaz, slapping Logen's hand away. 'Did I not\ntell you to wait?'\nLogen took an uncertain step back. He had never seen the Magus look\nso worried, but he couldn't keep his eyes off the strange thing on the slab. 'Is\nit a weapon?'\nBayaz breathed a long, slow breath. 'A most terrible one, my friend. A\nweapon against which no steel, no stone, no magic can protect you. Do not\neven tread near it, I warn you. There are dangers. The Divider, Kanedias\ncalled it, and with it he killed his brother Juvens, my master. He once told"

One here, one on the Other Side.'\n'What the hell does that mean?' muttered Logen. He couldn't even see\none edge you could cut with.\nBayaz shrugged. 'If I knew that I suppose that I'd be the Master Maker,\ninstead of merely the First of the Magi.' He reached forward and lifted the\nbox, wincing as though it was a great weight. 'Could you help me with this?'\nLogen hooked his hands under it, and gasped. It could hardly have\nweighed more if it was a block of solid iron. 'Heavy,' he grunted.\n'Kanedias forged it to be strong. As strong as all his great skill could\nmake it. Not to keep its contents safe from the World.' He leaned close and\nspoke softly. 'To keep the World safe from its contents.'\nLogen frowned down. 'What's in it?'\n'Nothing,' muttered Bayaz. 'Yet.'\nJezal was trying to think of three men in the world he hated more. Brint? He\nwas simply a swollen-headed idiot. Gorst? He had merely done his meagre\nbest to beat Jezal in a fencing match. Varuz? He was just a pompous old ass.\nNo. These three were at the top of his list. The arrogant old man with\nhis idiotic prattle and his self-important air of mystery. The hulking savage\nwith his ugly scars and his menacing frown. The patronising cripple with\nhis smug little comments and his pretensions of knowing all about life. The\nthree of them, combined with the stagnant air and perpetual gloom of this\nhorrible place, were almost enough to make Jezal puke again. The only\nthing he could imagine worse than his present company was no company at\nall. He looked into the shadows all around, and shuddered at the thought.\nStill, his spirits rose as they turned a corner. There was a small square of\ndaylight up ahead. He hurried towards it, overtaking Glokta as he shambled\nalong on his cane, mouth watering with anticipation at the thought of being\nback out under the sky.\nJezal closed his eyes with pleasure as he stepped into the open air. The\ncold wind stroked his face and he gasped in great lungfulls of it. The relief\nwas terrific, as though he had been trapped down there in the darkness for\nweeks, as though fingers clamped around his throat had just now been\nreleased. He walked forward across a wide, open space, paved with stark,\nflat stones. Ninefingers and Bayaz stood side by side up ahead, behind a\nparapet, waist high, and beyond them…\nThe Agriont came into view below. A patchwork of white walls, grey\nroofs, glinting windows, green gardens. They were nowhere near the\nsummit of the Maker's House, only on one of the lowest roofs, above the\ngate, but still terrifyingly high. Jezal recognised the crumbling University,\nthe shining dome of the Lords Round, the squat mass of the House of\nQuestions. He could see the Square of Marshals, a bowl of wooden seating"

He could see the Square of Marshals, a bowl of wooden seating\nin amongst the buildings, perhaps even the tiny yellow flash of the fencing\ncircle in its centre. Beyond the citadel, surrounded by its white wall and\ntwinkling moat, the city was a sprawling grey mass under the dirty grey sky,\nstretching all the way to the sea.\nJezal laughed with disbelief and delight. The Tower of Chains was a\nstep ladder compared to this. He was so high above the world that all\nseemed somehow still, frozen in time. He felt like a king. No man had seen\nthis, not for hundreds of years. He was huge, grand, far more important than\nthe tiny people that must live and work in the little buildings down there.\nHe turned to look at Glokta, but the cripple was not smiling. He was even\npaler than ever, frowning at the toy city, his left eye twitching with worry.\n'Scared of heights?' laughed Jezal.\nGlokta turned his ashen face toward him. 'There were no steps. We\nclimbed no steps to get here!' Jezal's grin began to fade. 'No steps, do you\nunderstand? How could it be? How? Tell me that!'\nJezal swallowed as he thought over the way they had come. The cripple\nwas right. No steps, no ramps, they had gone neither up nor down. Yet here\nthey were, far above the tallest tower of the Agriont. He felt sick, again. The\nview now seemed dizzying, disgusting, obscene. He backed unsteadily\naway from the parapet. He wanted to go home.\n'I followed him through the darkness, alone, and here I faced him.\nKanedias. The Master Maker. Here we fought. Fire, and steel, and flesh.\nHere we stood. He threw Tolomei from the roof before my eyes. I saw it\nhappen, but I could not stop him. His own daughter. Can you imagine? No\none could have deserved that less than she. There never was a more\ninnocent spirit.' Logen frowned. He hardly knew what to say to this.\n'Here we struggled,' muttered Bayaz, his meaty fists clenched tight on\nthe bare parapet. 'I tore at him, with fire and steel, and flesh, and he at me. I\ncast him down. He fell burning, and broke upon the bridge below. And so\nthe last of the sons of Euz passed from the world, so many of their secrets\nlost forever. They destroyed each other, all four of them. What a waste.'\nBayaz turned to look at Logen. 'But that was a long time ago, eh, my\nfriend? Long ago.' He puffed out his cheeks and hunched his shoulders. 'Let\nus leave this place. It feels like a tomb. It is a tomb. Let us seal it up once\nmore, and the memories with it. That is all in the past.'\n'Huh,' said Logen. 'My father used to say the seeds of the past bear fruit\nin the present.'\n'So they do.' Bayaz reached out slowly, and his fingers brushed against"

Bayaz reached out slowly, and his fingers brushed against\nthe cold, dark metal of the box in Logen's hands. 'So they do. Your father\nwas a wise man.'\nGlokta's leg was burning, his twisted spine was a river of fire from his arse\nto his skull. His mouth was dry as sawdust, his face sweaty and twitching,\nthe breath hissing in his nose, but he pressed on through the darkness, away\nfrom the vast hall with its black orb and its strange contraption, on towards\nthe open door. And into the light.\nHe stood there with his head tipped back, on the narrow bridge before\nthe narrow gateway, his hand trembling on the handle of his cane, blinking\nand rubbing his eyes, gasping in the free air and feeling the cool breeze on\nhis face. Who would have thought that wind could feel so fine? Maybe it's\njust as well there weren't any steps. I might never have made it out.\nLuthar was already halfway back across the bridge, hurrying as though\nhe had a devil a stride behind. Ninefingers was not far away, breathing hard\nand muttering something in Northern over and over. 'Still alive,' Glokta\nthought it might be. His big hands were clenched tight around that square\nmetal box, tendons standing out as though it weighed as much as an anvil.\nThere was more to this trip than just proving a point. What is it that they\nbrought out from there? What weighs so heavily? He glanced back into the\ndarkness, and shivered. He was not sure he even wanted to know.\nBayaz strolled out of the tunnel and into the open air, looking smug as\never. 'So, Inquisitor,' he said breezily. 'How did you find your trip into the\nHouse of the Maker?'\nA twisted, strange and horrible nightmare. I might even have preferred\nto return to the Emperor's prisons for a few hours. 'Something to do of a\nmorning,' he snapped.\n'I'm so glad you found it diverting,' chuckled Bayaz, as he pulled the rod\nof dark metal out from his shirt. 'And tell me, do you still believe that I'm a\nliar? Or have your suspicions finally been laid to rest?'\nGlokta frowned at the key. He frowned at the old man. He frowned into\nthe crushing darkness of the Maker's House. My suspicions grow with every\npassing moment. They are never laid to rest. They only change shape.\n'Honestly? I don't know what to believe.'\n'Good. Knowing your own ignorance is the first step to enlightenment.\nBetween you and me, though, I'd think of something else to tell the Arch\nLector.' Glokta felt his eyelid flickering. 'You'd better start across, eh,\nInquisitor? While I lock up?'\nThe plunge to the cold water below no longer seemed to hold much fear.\nIf I were to fall, at least I would die in the light.

He turned his\nprickling back, sucked his gums against the familiar waves of nausea, and\ncursed and struggled his limping way across the bridge.\nLuthar was hammering desperately on the old gates at the far end. 'Let\nus in!' he was nearly sobbing as Glokta hobbled up, an edge of cracked\npanic to his voice. 'Let us in!' The door finally wobbled open to reveal a\nshocked-looking Warden. Such a shame. I was sure that Captain Luthar\nwas about to burst into tears. The proud winner of the Contest, the Union's\nbravest young son, the very flower of manhood, blubbing on his knees. That\nsight could almost have made the trip worthwhile. Luthar darted through\nthe open gate and Ninefingers followed grimly after, cradling the metal box\nin his arms. The Warden squinted at Glokta as he limped up to the gate.\n'Back so soon?'\nYou old dolt. 'What the hell are you talking about, so soon?'\n'I'm only halfway through my eggs. You've been gone less than half an\nhour.'\nGlokta barked a joyless laugh. 'Half a day, perhaps.' But he frowned as\nhe peered past into the courtyard. The shadows were almost exactly where\nthey had been when they left. Early morning still, but how?\n'The Maker once told me that time is all in the mind.' Glokta winced as\nhe turned his head. Bayaz had come up behind him, and was tapping the\nside of his bald skull with a thick finger. 'It could be worse, believe me. It's\nwhen you come out before you went in that you really start to worry.' He\nsmiled, eyes glinting in the light through the doorway. Playing the fool? Or\ntrying to make a fool of me? Either way, these games grow tiresome.\n'Enough riddles,' sneered Glokta. 'Why not just tell me what you're\nafter?'\nThe First of the Magi, if such he was, grinned still wider. 'I like you,\nInquisitor, I really do. I wouldn't be surprised if you were the only honest\nman left in this whole damn country. We should have a talk at some point,\nyou and I. A talk about what I want, and about what you want.' His smile\nvanished. 'But not today.'\nAnd he stepped through the open door, leaving Glokta behind in the\nshadows.\nNobody's Dog\n« ^ »\n'Why me?' West murmured to himself through gritted teeth, staring across\nthe bridge towards the South Gate. That nonsense at the docks had taken\nhim longer than expected, much longer, but then didn't everything these\ndays?

To become involved in some pointless hold-up here at the\nvery gate of the Agriont was all he needed.\n'Why the hell must it be me?' His head was starting to hurt again. That\nall too familiar pulsing behind the eyes. Each day it seemed to come on\nearlier, and end up worse.\nBecause of the heat over the last few days, the guards had been\npermitted to come to duty without full armour. West reckoned that at least\ntwo of them were now regretting it. One was folded up on the ground near\nthe gate, hands clasped between his legs, whimpering noisily. His sergeant\nstood stooped over next to him, blood running from his nose and pattering\ndark red drops on the stones of the bridge. The two other soldiers in the\ndetail had their spears lowered, blades pointing towards a scrawny dark-\nskinned youth. Another southerner stood nearby, an old man with long grey\nhair, leaning against the handrail and watching the scene with an expression\nof profound resignation.\nThe youth glanced quickly over his shoulder and West felt a sting of\nsurprise. A woman: black hair hacked off short and sticking off her head in\na mess of greasy spikes. One sleeve was torn off round her shoulder and a\nlong, sinewy brown arm stuck out, ending in a fist bunched tight around the\ngrip of a curved knife. The blade shone, mirror bright and evilly sharp, the\none and only thing about her that looked clean. There was a thin, grey scar\nall the way down the right side of her face, through her black eyebrow and\nacross her scowling lips. It was her eyes, though, which truly caught West\noff guard: slightly slanted, narrowed with the deepest hostility and\nsuspicion, and yellow. He had seen all kinds of Kantics in his time, while he\nwas fighting in Gurkhul, in the war, but he never saw eyes like that before.\nDeep, rich, golden yellow, like…\nPiss. That was the smell, as he came closer. Piss, and dirt, and a lot of\nold, sour sweat. He remembered that from the war alright, the stink of men\nwho had not washed in a very long time. West fought the compulsion to\nwrinkle up his nose and breathe through his mouth as he approached, and\nthe urge to circle out wide and keep his distance from that glittering blade.\nYou have to show no fear if you're to calm a dangerous situation, however\nmuch you might be feeling. In his experience, if you could seem to be in\ncontrol, you were more than halfway to being there.\n'What the hell is going on here?' he growled at the bloody-faced\nsergeant. He had no need at all to feign annoyance, he was getting later and\nangrier by the second.\n'These stinking beggars wanted to come into the Agriont, sir! I tried to\nturn them away, of course, but they have letters!'\n'Letters?'\nThe strange old man tapped West on the shoulder, handed over a folded\nsheet of paper, slightly grubby round the edges. He read it, his frown\ngrowing steadily deeper. 'This is a letter of transit signed by Lord Hoff"

They must be admitted.'\n'But not armed, sir! I said they couldn't go in armed!' The sergeant held\nup an odd looking bow of dark wood in one hand, and a curved sword of\nthe Gurkish design in the other. 'It was enough of a struggle getting her to\ngive these up, but when I tried to search her… this Gurkish bitch…' The\nwoman hissed and took a quick step forward, and the sergeant and his two\nguards shuffled nervously back in a tight group.\n'Peace, Ferro,' sighed the old man in the Kantic tongue. 'For God's sake,\npeace.' The woman spat on the stones of the bridge and hissed some curse\nthat West could not understand, weaving the blade back and forth in a way\nthat suggested she knew how to use it, and was more than willing.\n'Why me?' West mumbled under his breath. It was plain he was going\nnowhere until this difficulty was resolved. As if he didn't have enough to\nworry about. He took a deep breath and did his best to put himself in the\nposition of the stinking woman: a stranger, surrounded by strange-looking\npeople speaking words she didn't understand, brandishing spears and trying\nto search her. Probably she was even now thinking about how horrible West\nsmelled. Disorientated and afraid, most likely, rather than dangerous. She\ndid look very dangerous though, and not in the least afraid.\nThe old man certainly seemed the more reasonable of the two, so West\nturned to him first. 'Are you two from Gurkhul?' he asked him in broken\nKantic.\nThe old man turned his tired eyes on West. 'No. There is more to the\nSouth than the Gurkish.'\n'Kadir then? Taurish?'\n'You know the South?'\n'A little. I fought there, in the war.'\nThe old man jerked his head at the woman, watching them suspiciously\nwith her slanted yellow eyes. 'She is from a place called Muntaz.'\n'I never heard of it.'\n'Why would you have?' The old man shrugged his bony shoulders. 'A\nsmall country, by the sea, far to the east of Shaffa, beyond the mountains.\nThe Gurkish conquered it years ago, and its people were scattered or made\nslaves. Apparently she has been in a foul mood ever since.' The woman\nscowled over at them, keeping one eye on the soldiers.\n'And you?'\n'Oh, I come from much further south, beyond Kanta, beyond the desert,\neven beyond the Circle of the World. The land of my birth will not be on\nyour maps, friend. Yulwei is my name.' He held out a long, black hand.\n'Collem West.' The woman watched them warily as they shook hands.\n'This one is called West, Ferro! He fought against the Gurkish! Will that\nmake you trust him?' Yulwei didn't sound very hopeful, and indeed the\nwoman's shoulders were still as hunched and bristling as ever, her grip on\nthe knife no less tight.

West heard himself roaring at the guard. 'Put your\nfucking spears up!' They blinked at him, shocked, and he fought to bring his\nvoice back under control. 'I don't think this is a full-scale invasion, do you?\nPut them up!'\nReluctantly the spearpoints drifted away from the woman. West stepped\nfirmly towards her, keeping his eyes fixed on hers with all the authority he\ncould muster. Show no fear, he thought to himself, but his heart was\nthumping. He held out his open palm, almost close enough to touch her.\n'The knife,' said West sharply in his bad Kantic. 'Please. You will not be\nharmed, you have my word.'\nThe woman stared at him with those slanted, beady yellow eyes, then at\nthe guards with the spears, then back to him. She took plenty of time over\nit. West stood there, mouth dry, head still thumping, getting later and later,\nsweating under his uniform in the hot sun, trying to ignore the woman's\nsmell. Time passed.\n'God's teeth, Ferro!' snapped the old man suddenly. 'I am old! Take pity\non me! I may only have a few years left! Give the man the knife, before I\ndie!'\n'Ssssss,' she hissed, curling her lip. For a dizzy, stretched-out moment\nthe knife went up, then the hilt slapped down into West's palm. He allowed\nhimself a dry swallow of relief. Right up until the last moment he had been\nalmost sure she would give him the sharp end.\n'Thank you,' he said, a deal more calmly than he felt. He handed the\nknife to the sergeant. 'Stow the weapons away and escort our guests into the\nAgriont, and if any harm comes to anyone, especially her, I'll be holding\nyou responsible, understand?' He glowered at the sergeant for a moment\nthen stepped through the gate into the tunnel before anything else could go\nwrong, leaving the old man and the stinking woman behind him. His head\nwas thumping harder even than before. Damn it he was late.\n'Why the hell me?' he grumbled to himself.\n'I am afraid the armouries are closed for the day,' sneered Major\nVallimir, staring down his nose at West as though at a beggar whining for\nsmall change. 'Our quotas are fulfilled, ahead of schedule, and we will not\nbe lighting the forges again this week. Perhaps if you had arrived on time…'\nThe pounding in West's head was growing worse than ever. He forced\nhimself to breathe slowly, and keep his voice calm and even. There was\nnothing to be gained by losing his temper. There was never anything to be\ngained by that.\n'I understand, Major,' said West patiently, 'but there is a war on. Many of\nthe levies we have received are scarcely armed, and Lord Marshal Burr has\nasked that the forges be lit, in order to provide equipment for them.'"

        "text": "the levies we have received are scarcely armed, and Lord Marshal Burr has\nasked that the forges be lit, in order to provide equipment for them.'\nThis was not entirely true, but since joining the Marshal's staff West had\nmore or less given up on telling the whole truth to anyone. That was no way\nto get anything done. He now employed a mixture of wheedling, bluster,\nand outright lies, humble entreaties and veiled threats, and had become\nquite expert at judging which tactic would be most effective on what man.\nUnfortunately, he had yet to strike the right chord with Major Vallimir,\nthe Master of the King's Armouries. Somehow, their being equal in rank\nmade matters all the more difficult: he could not quite get away with\nbullying the man, but could not quite bring himself to beg.\nFurthermore, in terms of social standing they were anything but equals.\nVallimir was old nobility, from a powerful family, and arrogant beyond\nbelief. He made Jezal dan Luthar seem a humble, selfless type, and his total\nlack of experience in the field only made matters worse: he behaved doubly\nlike an ass in order to compensate. Instructions from West, though they\nmight come from Marshal Burr himself, were as welcome as they would\nhave been from a reeking swineherd.\nToday was no exception. 'This month's quotas are fulfilled, Major West,'\nVallimir managed to put a sneering emphasis into the name, 'and so the\nforges are closed. That is all.'\n'And this is what you would have me tell the Lord Marshal?'\n'The arming of levies is the responsibility of those lords that provide\nthem,' he recited primly. 'I cannot be blamed if they fall short on their\nobligations. It is simply not our problem, Major West, and you may tell that\nto the Lord Marshal.'\nThis was always the way of it. Back and forth: from Burr's offices to the\nvarious commissary departments, to the commanders of companies, of\nbattalions, of regiments, to the stores scattered around the Agriont and the\ncity, to the armouries, the barracks, the stables, to the docks where the\nsoldiers and their equipment would begin to embark in just a few short\ndays, to other departments and back to where he began, with miles walked\nand nothing done. Each night he would drop into bed like a stone, only to\nstart up a few hours later with it all to do again.\nAs commander of a battalion his trade had been to fight the enemy with\nsteel. As a staff officer, it seemed, his role was to fight his own side with\npaper, more secretary than soldier. He felt like a man trying to push a huge\nstone up a hill. Straining and straining, getting nowhere, but unable to stop\npushing in case the rock should fall and crush him. Meanwhile, arrogant\nbastards who were in just the same danger lazed on the slopes beside him\nsaying, 'Well, it's not my rock.'\nHe understood now why, during the war in Gurkhul, there had\nsometimes not been enough food for the men to eat, or clothes for them to\nwear, or wagons to draw the supplies with, or horses to draw the wagons, or\nall manner of other things that were deeply necessary and easily anticipated."

'I\nhave no doubts as to your courage, I assure you, that was not my meaning at\nall.' He tried to put himself in Vallimir's position.

'This is not a question of your honour, Major, or that of\nyour family. This is a question of our being fit for war!'\nVallimir's eyes had turned deadly cold. 'Just who do you think you're\ntalking to, you dirty commoner? All the influence you have you owe to\nBurr, and who is he but an oaf from the provinces, risen to his rank by\nfortune alone?' West blinked. He guessed what they said about him behind\nhis back of course, but it was another thing to hear it to his face. 'And when\nBurr is gone, what will become of you? Eh? Where will you be without him\nto hide behind? You've no blood, no family!' Vallimir's lips twisted in a cold\nsneer. 'Apart from that sister of yours of course, and from what I hear—'\nWest found himself moving forward, fast. 'What?' he snarled. 'What was\nthat?' His expression must have been dire indeed: he saw the colour\ndraining from Vallimir's face.\n'I… I—'\n'You think I need Burr to fight my battles, you fucking gutless worm?'\nBefore he knew it he had moved again, and Vallimir stumbled back towards\nthe wall, flinching sideways and raising one arm as if to ward off an\nexpected blow. It was the most West could do to stop his hands from\ngrabbing hold of the little bastard and shaking him until his head came off.\nHis own skull was throbbing, pounding. He felt as though the pressure\nwould pop his eyes right out of his head. He dragged in long, slow breaths\nthrough his nose, clenched his fists until they hurt. The anger slowly\nsubsided, back below the point where it threatened to take sudden control of\nhis body. It only pulsed now, squeezing at his chest.\n'If you have something to say on the subject of my sister,' he whispered"

It only pulsed now, squeezing at his chest.\n'If you have something to say on the subject of my sister,' he whispered\nsoftly, 'then you can say it. Say it now.' He let his left hand drop slowly to\nsit on the hilt of his sword. 'And we can settle this outside the city walls.'\nMajor Vallimir shrank back still further. 'I heard nothing,' he whispered,\n'nothing at all.'\n'Nothing at all.' West looked down into his white face for a moment\nlonger, then stepped away. 'Now if you would be so good as to reopen the\nforges for me? We have a great deal of work to get through.'\nVallimir blinked for a moment. 'Of course. I will have them lit at once.'\nWest turned on his heel and stalked off, knowing the man was\nglowering daggers at his back, knowing that he had made yet another bad\nsituation worse. One more high-born enemy among the many. The really\ngalling thing was that the man was right. Without Burr, he was as good as\nfinished. He had no family apart from that sister of his. Damn it, his head\nhurt. 'Why me?' he hissed to himself. 'Why?'\nThere was still a lot to do today, enough for a whole day's work on its own,\nbut West could take no more. His head hurt so badly that he could hardly\nsee. He had to lie down in the dark, with a wet cloth over his face, if only\nfor an hour, if only for a minute. He fumbled in his pocket for his key, his\nother hand clamped over his aching eyes, his teeth locked together. Then he\nheard a sound on the other side of the door. A faint clink of glass. Ardee.\n'No,' he hissed to himself. Not now! Why the hell had he ever given her\na key? Cursing softly, he raised his fist to knock. Knocking on his own\ndoor, that was where he was now. His fist never made it to the wood. A\nmost unpleasant image began to form in the back of his mind. Ardee and\nLuthar, naked and sweaty, writhing around on his carpet. He turned his key\nswiftly in the lock and shoved the door open.\nShe was standing by the window, alone and, he was relieved to see,\nfully dressed. He was less pleased to see her filling a glass right to the brim\nfrom the decanter though. She raised an eyebrow at him as he burst through\nthe door.\n'Oh, it's you.'\n'Who the hell else would it be?' snapped West. 'These are my rooms,\naren't they?'\n'Somebody's not in the best of moods this morning.' A bit of wine\nslopped over the rim of her glass and onto the table. She wiped it up with\nher hand and sucked her fingers, then took a long swig from the glass for\ngood measure. Her every movement niggled at him.\nWest grimaced and shoved the door shut. 'Do you have to drink so\nmuch?'\n'I understand that a young lady should have a beneficial pastime.' Her\nwords were careless, as usual, but even through his headache West could"

Her\nwords were careless, as usual, but even through his headache West could\ntell there was something strange going on. She kept glancing towards the\ndesk, then she was moving towards it. He got there first, snatched up a\npiece of paper from the top, one line written on it.\n'What's this?'\n'Nothing! Give it me!'\nHe held her away with one arm and read it:\nThe usual place, tomorrow night—\nA.\nWest's skin prickled with horror. 'Nothing? Nothing?' He shook the\nletter under his sister's nose. Ardee turned away from him, flicking her head\nas you might at a fly, saying nothing, but slurping noisily from her glass.\nWest ground his teeth.\n'It's Luthar, isn't it?'\n'I didn't say so.'\n'You didn't have to.' The paper crumpled up into a tiny ball in his white-\nknuckled hand. He half turned towards the door, every muscle tensed and\ntrembling. It was the most he could do to stop himself dashing out and\nthrottling the little bastard right now, but he was just able to make himself\nthink for a moment.\nJezal had let him down, and badly, that ungrateful shit. But it was hardly\nthat shocking—the man was an ass. You keep your wine in a paper bag you\nshouldn't be too upset when it leaks. Besides, Jezal wasn't the one writing\nthe letters. What good would stepping on his neck do? There would always\nbe more empty-headed young men in the world.\n'Just where are you going with this, Ardee?'\nShe sat down on the settle and glared at him frostily over the rim of her\nglass. 'With what, brother?'\n'You know with what!'\n'Aren't we family? Can't we be candid with each other? If you have\nsomething to say you can out and say it! Where do you think I'm going?'\n'I think you're going straight to shit, since you ask!' He squeezed his\nvoice back down with the greatest of difficulty. 'This business with Luthar\nhas gone way too far. Letters? Letters? I warned him, but it seems he wasn't\nthe problem! What are you thinking? Are you thinking at all? It has to stop,\nbefore people start to talk!' He felt a suffocating tightness in his chest, took\na deep breath, but his voice burst out anyway. 'They're damn well talking\nalready! It stops now! Do you hear me?'\n'I hear you,' she said carelessly, 'but who cares what they think?'\n'I care!' He nearly screamed it. 'Do you know how hard I have to work?\nDo you think I'm a fool? You know what you're about, Ardee!' Her face was\nturning sullen, but he forged on. 'It's not as though this is the first time!\nMust I remind you, your luck with men has not exactly been the best!'\n'Not with the men in my family, at least!' She was sitting bolt upright\nnow, face tight and pale with anger. 'And what would you know about my\nluck? We've hardly talked in ten years!'"

Have you considered that? Would his family be charmed\nby the blushing bride, do you think? At best they'd never speak to you. At\nworst they'd cut you both off!' He pointed a shaking finger at the door.\n'Haven't you noticed he's a vain, arrogant swine! They all are! How would\nhe manage, do you think, without his allowance? Without his friends in\nhigh places? He wouldn't know where to begin! How could you be happy\nwith each other?' His head was ready to split in half, but he ranted on. And\nwhat happens if, as is far more likely, you can't get him? What then? You'd\nbe finished, have you thought on that? You've come close enough before!\nAnd you're supposed to be the clever one! You're making a laughing-stock\nof yourself!' He almost choked on his rage. 'Of both of us!'\nArdee gave a gasp. 'Now we see it!' she nearly screamed at him. 'No one\ncares a shit for me, but if your reputation is in danger—'\n'You fucking stupid bitch!' The decanter flew spinning across the room.\nIt crashed against the wall not far from Ardee's head, sending fragments of\nglass flying and wine running down the plaster. It made him more furious.\n'Why don't you fucking listen?'\nHe was across the room in an instant. Ardee looked surprised, just for a\nmoment, then there was a sharp click—his fist catching her in the face as\nshe got up. She didn't fall far. His hands caught her before she hit the\nground, yanked her up then flung her back against the wall.\n'You'll be the end of us!' Her head smacked against the plaster—once,\ntwice, three times. One hand grabbed hold of her neck.\nTeeth bared. Body crushed her against the wall. A little snort in her\nthroat as the fingers began to squeeze.\n'You selfish, useless… fucking… whore!'\nHair was tangled across her face. He could only see a narrow slice of\nskin, the corner of a mouth, one dark eye.\nThe eye stared back at him. Painless. Fearless. Empty, flat, like a\ncorpse.\nSqueeze. Snort. Squeeze.\nSqueeze…\nWest came to his senses with a sickening jolt. The fingers snapped open,\nhe jerked the hand away. His sister stayed upright against the wall. He could\nhear her breathing. Short gasps. Or was that him? His head was splitting.\nThe eye was still staring at him.\nHe must have imagined it. Must have. Any second now he would wake\nup, the nightmare would be over. A dream. Then she pushed the hair out of\nher face.\nHer skin was candle wax, pasty white. The trickle of blood from her\nnose looked almost black against it. The pink marks stood out vivid on her"

'Ardee…' He was\nso disgusted he half vomited as he said the word. He could taste the bile at\nthe back of his mouth, but his voice wouldn't stop gurgling away. 'I'm\nsorry… I'm so sorry… Are you alright?'\n'I've had worse.' She reached up slowly and touched her lip with a\nfinger-tip. The blood smeared out across her mouth.\n'Ardee…' One hand reached out to her, then he jerked it back, afraid of\nwhat it might do. 'I'm sorry…'\n'He was always sorry. Don't you remember? He'd hold us and cry\nafterwards. Always sorry. But it never stopped him the next time. Have you\nforgotten?'\nWest gagged, choked back vomit again. If she'd wept, and ranted, and\nbeat him with her fists, it would have been easier to bear. Anything but this.\nHe tried never to think about it, but he hadn't forgotten. 'No,' he whispered,\n'I remember.'\n'Did you think he stopped when you left? He got worse. Only then I'd\nhide on my own. I used to dream that you'd come back, come back and save\nme. But when you did come back it wasn't for long, and things weren't the\nsame between us, and you did nothing.'\n'Ardee… I didn't know—'\n'You knew, but you got away. It was easier to do nothing. To pretend. I\nunderstand, and do you know, I don't even blame you. It was some kind of\ncomfort, back then, to know you got away. The day he died was the\nhappiest of my life.'\n'He was our father—'\n'Oh yes. My bad luck. Bad luck with men. I cried at the grave like a\ndutiful daughter.

I read the letter over and\nover. The pathetic little dreams all came alive again. Hope, eh? What a\nfucking curse! Off to live with my brother. My protector. He'll look out for\nme, he'll help me.

She was right. He had failed her. Long before\ntoday. While he had been playing with swords and kissing the arses of\npeople who despised him, she had been suffering. A little effort was all it\nwould have taken, but he could never face it. Every minute he had spent\nwith her he felt the guilt, like a rock in his gut, weighing him down,\nunbearable.\nShe stepped away from the wall. 'Perhaps I'll go and pay a call on Jezal.\nHe may be the shallowest idiot in the whole city, but I don't think he'd ever\nraise a hand to me, do you?' She pushed him out of the way and made for\nthe door.\n'Ardee!' he caught hold of her arm. 'Please… Ardee… I'm sorry…'\nShe stuck her tongue out, curled it into a tube, and blew bloody spit\nthrough it. It splattered softly down the front of his uniform. 'That's for your\nsorry, bastard.'\nThe door banged shut in his face.\nEach Man Worships Himself\n« ^ »\nFerro stared at the big pink through narrowed eyes, and he stared back. It\nhad been going on for a good while now, not all the time, but most of it.\nStaring. They were all ugly, these soft white things, but this one was\nsomething special.\nHideous.\nShe knew that she was scarred, and weathered by sun and wind, worn\ndown by years in the wilderness, but the pale skin on this one's face looked\nlike a shield hard used in battle—chopped, gouged, torn, dented. It was\nsurprising to see the eyes still alive in a face so battered, but they were, and\nthey were watching her.\nShe had decided he was dangerous.\nNot just big, but strong. Brutal strong. Twice her weight maybe, and his\nthick neck was all sinew. She could feel the strength coming off him. She\nwouldn't have been surprised if he could lift her with one hand, but that\ndidn't worry her too much. He'd have to get a hold on her first. Big and\nstrong can make a man slow.\nSlow and dangerous don't mix.\nScars didn't worry her either. They just meant he'd been in a lot of\nfights, they didn't say whether he'd won. It was other things. The way he sat\n—still but not quite relaxed. Ready. Patient. The way his eyes moved—\ncunning, careful, from her to the rest of the room, then back to her. Dark\neyes, watching, thoughtful. Weighing her up. Thick veins on the backs of\nhis hands, but long fingers, clever fingers, lines of dirt under the nails. One\nfinger missing. A white stump. She didn't like any of it. Smelled like\ndanger.\nShe wouldn't want to fight this one unarmed.\nBut she'd given her knife over to that pink on the bridge. She'd been on\nthe very point of stabbing him, but at the last moment she'd changed her\nmind. Something in his eyes had reminded her of Aruf, before the Gurkish"

Sad and level, as if he understood her. As if she\nwas a person, and not a thing. At the last moment, despite herself, she'd\ngiven the blade away. Allowed herself to be led in here.\nStupid!\nShe regretted it now, bitterly, but she'd fight any way she could, if she\nhad to. Most people never realise how full the world is of weapons. Things\nto throw, or throw enemies on to. Things to break, or use as clubs. Wound-\nup cloths to strangle with. Dirt to fling in faces. Failing that, she'd bite his\nthroat out. She curled her lips back and showed him her teeth to prove it,\nbut he seemed not to notice. Just sat there, watching. Silent, still, ugly, and\ndangerous.\n'Fucking pinks,' she hissed to herself.\nThe thin one, by contrast, hardly seemed dangerous at all. Ill-looking,\nwith long hair like a woman's. Awkward and twitchy, licking his lips. He\nwould sneak the odd glance at her, but look away as soon as she scowled\nover at him, swallowing, the knobbly lump in his neck squirming up and\ndown. He seemed scared, no threat, but Ferro kept him in the corner of her\neye while she watched the big one. Best not to dismiss him entirely.\nLife had taught her to expect surprises.\nThat just left the old man. She didn't trust a one of these pinks, but she\ntrusted this bald one least of all. Many deep lines on his face, round his\neyes, round his nose. Cruel lines. Hard, heavy bones in his cheeks. Big\nthick hands, white hairs on the backs of them. If she had to kill these three,\nfor all the danger that the big one seemed to offer, she decided she would\nkill this bald one first. He had the look of a slaver in his eye, staring at her\nup and down, all over. A cold look, judging what she might be worth.\nBastard.\nBayaz, Yulwei called him, and the two old men seemed to know each\nother well. 'So, brother,' the bald pink was saying in the Kantic tongue,\nthough it was plain enough they weren't related, 'how is it in the great\nEmpire of Gurkhul?'\nYulwei sighed. 'Only a year since he seized the crown, and Uthman has\nbroken the last of the rebels, and brought the governors firmly to heel.\nAlready, the young Emperor is more feared than ever his father was.\nUthman-ul-Dosht, his soldiers call him, and proudly. Almost all of Kanta is\nin his grip. He reigns supreme all round the Southern Sea.'\n'Aside from Dagoska.'\n'True, but his eyes are bent on it. His armies swarm toward the\npeninsula, and his agents are ever busy behind Dagoska's great walls. Now\nthat there is war in the North, it cannot be long before he feels the time is\nripe to lay siege to the city, and when he does, I do not think it can stand\nlong against him.'"

The Union still controls the seas.'\nYulwei frowned. 'We saw ships, brother. Many great ships. The Gurkish\nhave built a fleet. A powerful one, in secret. They must have begun years\nago, during the last war. I fear the Union will control the seas but little\nlonger.'\n'A fleet? I had hoped to have a few more years in which to prepare.' The\nbald pink sounded grim. 'My plans only become the more urgent.'\nShe was bored with their talk. She was used to being always on the\nmove, keeping always one stride ahead, and she hated to stand still. Stay\ntoo long in one place, and the Gurkish would find you. She wasn't\ninterested in being an exhibit for these curious pinks to stare at. She\nsauntered off around the room while the two old men made endless words,\nscowling and sucking her teeth. She swung her arms around. She kicked at\nthe worn boards of the floor. She poked at the cloths on the walls, and\npeered behind them, ran her fingers along the edges of the furniture, clicked\nher tongue and snapped her teeth together.\nMaking everyone nervous.\nShe passed by the big ugly pink in the chair, almost close enough for\nher swinging hand to touch his pitted skin. Just to show him that she didn't\ncare a shit for his size, or his scars, or anything else. Then she strutted over\nto the nervous one. The skinny pink with the long hair. He swallowed as she\ncame close.\n'Sssss,' she hissed at him. He muttered something and shuffled away,\nand she stepped up to the open window in his place. Looking out, turning\nher back on the room.\nJust to show the pinks she didn't care a shit for any of them.\nThere were gardens outside the window. Trees, plants, wide sweeps of\nlawn neatly arranged. Groups of fat, pale men and women lazed around in\nthe sun on the carefully cut grass, stuffing their sweaty faces with food.\nSwilling down drink. She scowled down at them. Fat, ugly, lazy pinks, with\nno God but eating and idleness.\n'Gardens,' she sneered.\nThere had been gardens in Uthman's palace. She used to look at them\nfrom the tiny window of her room. Her cell. Long before he became\nUthman-ul-Dosht. When he had only been the Emperor's youngest son.\nWhen she had been one among his many slaves. His prisoner. Ferro leaned\nforward and spat out of the window.\nShe hated gardens.\nShe hated cities altogether. Places of slavery, fear, degradation. Their\nwalls were the walls of a prison. The sooner she was gone from this\naccursed place the happier she would be. Or the less unhappy, at least. She\nturned away from the window, and scowled again. They were all staring at\nher.\nThe one called Bayaz was the first to speak. 'It certainly is quite a\nstriking thing you've discovered, brother. You wouldn't miss her in a crowd,\neh? Are you sure she's what I'm looking for?'"

'As sure as I can be.'\n'I'm standing right here,' she growled at them, but the bald pink went on\ntalking as though she couldn't hear.\n'Does she feel pain?'\n'But little. She fought an Eater on the road.'\n'Really?' Bayaz chuckled softly to himself. 'How badly did it hurt her?'\n'Badly, but in two days she was walking, in a week she was healed. She\nshows not a scratch from it. That is not normal.'\n'We have both seen many things that are not normal in our times. We\nmust be sure.' The bald man reached into a pocket. Ferro watched\nsuspiciously as he pulled out his fist, placed it on the table. When he took it\naway two smooth, polished stones lay on the wood.\nThe bald man leaned forward. 'Tell me, Ferro, which is the blue stone?'\nShe stared at him, hard, then down at the stones. There was no\ndifference between them. They were all watching her, closer than ever now,\nand she ground her teeth.\n'That one.' She pointed to the one on the left.\nBayaz smiled. 'Exactly the answer I was hoping for.' Ferro shrugged her\nshoulders. Lucky, she thought, to guess the right one. Then she noticed the\nlook on the big pink's face. He was frowning at the two stones, as though he\ndidn't understand.\n'They both are red,' said Bayaz. 'You see no colours at all, eh, Ferro?'\nSo the bald pink had played a trick on her. She wasn't sure how he could\nhave known, but she was sure she didn't like it. No one plays tricks on Ferro\nMaljinn. She started to laugh. A rough, ugly, unpractised gurgling.\nThen she sprang across the table.\nThe look of surprise was just forming on the old pink's face as her fist\ncrunched into his nose. He gave a grunt, chair tipping backwards, sprawling\nout onto the floor. She scrambled across the table to get at him, but Yulwei\ngrabbed hold of her leg and dragged her back. Her clawing hands missed\nthe bald bastard's neck and hauled the table over on its side instead, the two\nstones skittering away across the boards.\nShe shook her leg free and went for the old pink as he staggered up\nfrom the floor, but Yulwei caught her arm and pulled her back again, all the\nwhile yelling, 'Peace!' He got her elbow in his face for his trouble, and\nsagged back against the wall with her on top of him. She was first up, ready\nto go at the bald bastard again.\nBy now the big one was on his feet though, and moving forward, still\nwatching her. Ferro smiled at him, fists clenched at her sides. Now she\nwould see how dangerous he really was.\nHe took another step.\nThen Bayaz put an arm out to stop him. He had his other hand clasped\nto his nose, trying to staunch the flow of blood.

He looked\nsomehow different now, though nothing had changed. Friendly, considerate,\nhonest. Sorry. But it took more than that to win her trust. A lot more.\n'We'll see,' she hissed.\n'That's all I ask. That, and that you give Yulwei and I a moment to\ndiscuss some… matters. Matters best discussed in private.'\n'It's alright, Ferro,' said Yulwei, 'they are friends.' She was damn sure\nthey weren't her friends, but she allowed him to shepherd her out of the\ndoor behind the two pinks. 'Just try not to kill any of them.'\nThis room was much like the other. They had to be rich, these pinks, for\nall they didn't look it. Great big fireplace, made of dark veined stone.\nCushions, and soft cloth round the window, covered in flowers and birds in\ntiny stitches. There was a painting of a stern man with a crown on his head,\nfrowning down at Ferro from the wall. She frowned back at him. Luxury.\nFerro hated luxury even more than she hated gardens.\nLuxury meant captivity more surely than the bars of a cage. Soft\nfurniture spelled danger more surely than weapons. Hard ground and cold\nwater was all she needed. Soft things make you soft, and she wanted no part\nof that.\nThere was another man waiting in there, walking round and round with\nhis hands behind his back, as though he didn't like to stand still too long.\nNot quite a pink, his leathery skin was somewhere between hers and theirs\nin tone. Head shaved, like a priest. Ferro didn't like that.\nShe hated priests most of all.\nHis eyes lit up when he saw her though, for all her sneering at him, and\nhe hurried over. A strange little man in travel-worn clothes, the top of his\nhead came up no higher than Ferro's mouth. 'I am Brother Longfoot,'\nflapping his hands around all over the place, 'of the great order of\nNavigators.'\n'Lucky for you.'

God has truly blessed me! I\ndeclare that never, in all of history, has a man been so well suited to his\nprofession, or a profession to a man, as I, Brother Longfoot, am suited to\nthe noble science of Navigation! From the snow-covered mountains of the\nfar North, to the sun-drenched sands of the utmost South, the whole world\nis my home, truly!'\nHe smiled at her with a look of sickening self-satisfaction. Ferro\nignored him. The two pinks, the big one and the scrawny one, were talking"

The two pinks, the big one and the scrawny one, were talking\nto each other on the far side of the room. They spoke in some language she\ndidn't understand. Sounded like pigs grunting. Talking about her maybe, but\nshe didn't care. They went out another door, leaving her alone with the\npriest, still flapping his lips.\n'There are few nations within the Circle of the World to which I, Brother\nLongfoot, am a stranger, and yet I am at a loss as to your origins.' He waited\nexpectantly, but Ferro said nothing. 'You would like me to guess, then?\nIndeed, it is a riddle. Let me see… your eyes have the shape of the people\nof distant Suljuk, where the black mountains rise sheer from the sparkling\nsea, indeed they do, and yet your skin is—'\n'Stop your mouth, cunt.'\nThe man paused in mid-sentence, coughed and moved away, leaving\nFerro to attend to the voices on the other side of the door. She smiled to\nherself. The wood was thick and the sounds were muffled, but the two old\nmen had not reckoned on the sharpness of her ears. They were still speaking\nin Kantic. Now that idiot of a Navigator was quiet she could make out every\nword that Yulwei was saying.\n'… Khalul breaks the Second Law, so you must break the First? I like it\nnot, Bayaz! Juvens would never have allowed this!' Ferro frowned. Yulwei\nhad a strange note in his voice. Fear. The Second Law. He had spoken of it\nto the Eaters, Ferro remembered. It is forbidden to eat the flesh of men.\nShe heard the bald pink next. 'The First Law is a paradox. All magic\ncomes from the Other Side, even ours. Whenever you change a thing you\ntouch the world below, whenever you make a thing you borrow from the\nOther Side, and there is always a cost.'\n'But the cost of this might be too high! It is a cursed thing, this Seed, a\ndamned thing. Nothing but chaos grows from it! The sons of Euz, so great\nin wisdom and power, this Seed was the end of them, of all of them, in\ndifferent ways. Are you wiser than Juvens, Bayaz? Are you more cunning\nthan Kanedias? Are you stronger than Glustrod?'\n'None of those, brother, but tell me… how many Eaters has Khalul\nmade?'\nA long pause. 'I cannot be sure.'\n'How many?'\nAnother pause. 'Perhaps two hundred. Perhaps more. The priesthood\nscour the South for those with any promise. Faster and faster now he makes\nthem, but most are young, and weak.'\n'Two hundred or more, and growing all the time. Many are weak, but\namong them are some that might be a match for you or I. Those that were\nKhalul's apprentices in the Old Time—the one they called the East Wind,\nand those cursed bloody twins.'\n'Damn those bitches!' Yulwei groaned.\n'Not to mention Mamun, whose lies began this chaos.'\n'The trouble was well rooted before he was even born, you know it,"

Still Mamun was in the Badlands. I felt him near. He is grown\nterrible strong.'\n'You know that I am right. Meanwhile, our numbers hardly grow.'\n'I thought this one, Quai, showed promise?'\n'We need only a hundred more like him and twenty years in which to\ntrain them. Then we might stand on equal terms. No, brother, no. We must\nuse fire against fire.'\n'Even if the fire burns you and all creation to ashes? Let me go to\nSarkant. Khalul might yet hear reason—'\nLaughter. 'He has enslaved half the world! When will you wake,\nYulwei? When he has enslaved the rest of it? I cannot afford to lose you,\nbrother!'\n'Remember, Bayaz, there are worse things than Khalul. Far worse.' His\nvoice dropped to a whisper and Ferro strained to hear. 'The Tellers of\nSecrets are always listening…'\n'Enough, Yulwei! It is better not even to think of it!' Ferro frowned.\nWhat was this nonsense? Tellers of Secrets? What secrets?\n'Remember what Juvens told you, Bayaz. Beware of pride. You have\nbeen using the Art. I know it. I see a shadow on you.'\n'Damn your shadows! I do what I must! Remember what Juvens told\nyou, Yulwei. One cannot watch forever. Time is short, and I will watch no\nlonger. I am first. It is my decision to make.'\n'Have I not always followed where you have led? Always, even when\nmy conscience told me otherwise?'\n'And have I ever led you wrong?'\n'That remains to be seen. You are first, Bayaz, but you are not Juvens. It\nis my part to question, and that of Zacharus too. He will like this still less\nthan I. Far less.'\n'It must be done.'\n'But others will pay the price, as they always have. This Northman,\nNinefingers, he can speak to the spirits?'\n'Yes.' Ferro frowned. Spirits? The nine-fingered pink had scarcely\nlooked as if he could speak to other humans.\n'And if you find the Seed,' came Yulwei's voice from behind the door,\n'you mean for Ferro to carry it?'\n'She has the blood, and someone must.'\n'Be careful then, Bayaz. I know you, remember. Few better. Give me\nyour word that you will keep her safe, even after she has served your\npurpose.'\n'I will guard her more closely than I would my own child.'\n'Guard her closer than you did the Maker's child, and I will be satisfied.'\nA long silence. Ferro worked her jaw as she thought on what she had\nheard. Juvens, Kanedias, Zacharus—the strange names meant nothing to\nher. And what kind of seed could burn all creation to ashes? She wanted no\npart of any such thing, she was sure of that. Her place was in the south,\nfighting the Gurkish with weapons that she understood."

Her place was in the south,\nfighting the Gurkish with weapons that she understood.\nThe door opened, and the two old men stepped through. They could\nhardly have looked more different. One dark-skinned, tall and bony with\nlong hair, the other white-skinned, heavy-built and bald. She looked at them\nsuspiciously. It was the white one who spoke first.\n'Ferro, I have an offer to—'\n'I am not going with you, old pink fool.'\nThe slightest shadow of annoyance flitted across the bald man's face,\nbut was quickly mastered. 'Why? What other business have you which is so\nvery pressing?'\nThat needed no thinking about. 'Vengeance.' Her favourite word.\n'Ah. I see. You hate the Gurkish?'\n'Yes.'\n'They owe you a debt, for what they have done to you?'\n'Yes.'\n'For taking your family, your people, your country?'\n'Yes.'\n'For making you a slave,' he whispered. She glowered back at him,\nwondering how he knew so much about her, wondering whether to go for\nhim again. 'They have robbed you, Ferro, robbed you of everything. They\nhave stolen your life from you. If I were you… if I had suffered as you have\nsuffered… there would not be enough blood in all the South to satisfy me. I\nwould see every Gurkish soldier made a corpse before I was satisfied. I\nwould see every Gurkish city burn before I was satisfied. I would see their\nEmperor rotting in a cage before his own palace before I was satisfied!'\n'Yes!' she hissed, a fierce smile across her face. He was talking her\nlanguage now. Yulwei had never talked so—perhaps this old pink wasn't so\nbad after all. 'You understand! That is why I must go south!'\n'No, Ferro.' It was the bald man grinning now. 'You do not realise the\nchance that I am offering you. The Emperor does not truly rule in Kama.\nMighty though he seems, he dances to the tune of another, a hand well\nhidden. Khalul, they call him.'\n'The Prophet.'\nBayaz nodded. 'If you are cut, do you hate the knife, or the one who\nwields it? The Emperor, the Gurkish, they are but Khalul's tools, Ferro.\nEmperors come and go, but the Prophet is always there, behind them.\nWhispering. Suggesting. Ordering. He is the one that owes you.'\n'Khalul… yes.' The Eaters had used that name. Khalul. The Prophet.\nThe Emperor's palace was filled with priests, everyone knew it. The palaces\nof the governors too. Priests, they were everywhere, swarming, like insects.\nIn the cities, in the villages, in amongst the soldiers, always spreading their\nlies. Whispering. Suggesting. Ordering.

Tens of thousands! Perhaps the\nEmperor himself, who knows?' He shrugged, and half turned away from\nher. 'Still, I cannot force you. Go back to the Badlands, if you wish—hide,\nand run, and grub in the dust like a rat. If that satisfies you. If that is the full\nmeasure of your vengeance. The Eaters want you now. Khalul's children.\nWithout us they will have you, and sooner rather than later. Still, the choice\nis yours.'\nFerro frowned. All those years in the wilderness, fighting tooth and nail,\nalways running, had got her nothing. No vengeance worthy of the word. If\nit had not been for Yulwei, she would be finished now. White bones in the\ndesert. Meat in the bellies of the Eaters. In the cage before the Emperor's\npalace.\nRotting.\nShe could not say no, and she knew it, but she did not like it. This old\nman had known exactly what to offer her. She hated to have no choice.\n'I will think about it,' she said.\nAgain, the slightest shadow of anger on the bald pink's face, quickly\ncovered. 'Think about it then, but not for long. The Emperor's soldiers are\nmassing, and time is short.' He followed the others out of the room, leaving\nher alone with Yulwei.\n'I do not like these pinks,' she said, loud enough for the old one to hear\nher in the corridor, and then more softly. 'Do we have to go with them?'\n'You do. I must return to the South.'\n'What?'\n'Someone must keep watch on the Gurkish.'\n'No!'\nYulwei began to laugh. 'Twice you have tried to kill me. Once you have\ntried to run away from me, but now that I am leaving you want me to stay?\nThere's no understanding you, Ferro.'\nShe frowned. 'This bald one says he can give me vengeance. Does he\nlie?'\n'No.'\n'Then I must go with him.'\n'I know. That is why I brought you here.'\nShe could think of nothing to say. She looked down at the floor, but\nYulwei surprised her by stepping forward suddenly. She raised her hand, to\nward off a blow, but instead he put his arms round her and squeezed her\ntightly. A strange feeling. Being so close to someone else. Warm. Then\nYulwei stepped away, one hand on her shoulder. 'Walk in God's footsteps,\nFerro Maljinn.'\n'Huh. They have no God here.'\n'Say rather that they have many.'\n'Many?'\n'Had you not noticed? Here, each man worships himself.' She nodded.\nThat seemed close to the truth. 'Be careful, Ferro. And listen to Bayaz. He is\nthe first of my order, and few indeed are wise as he.'\n'I do not trust him.'\nYulwei leaned closer. 'I did not tell you to trust him.'

She watched him walk slowly to the door, then out into\nthe corridor. She heard his bare feet flapping away on the tiles, the bangles\non his arms jingling softly.\nLeaving her alone with the luxury, and the gardens, and the pinks.\nOld Friends\n« ^ »\nThere was a thumping knock at the door, and Glokta jerked his head up, left\neye suddenly twitching. Who the hell comes knocking at this hour? Frost?\nSeverard? Or someone else? Superior Goyle, maybe, come to pay me a visit\nwith his circus freaks? Might the Arch Lector have grown tired of his toy\ncripple already? One could hardly say the feast went according to plan, and\nhis Eminence is hardly the forgiving type. Body found floating by the\ndocks…\nThe knocking came again. Loud, confident knocking. The kind that\ndemands the door be opened, before it's broken down. 'I'm coming!' he\nshouted, voice cracking slightly as he prised himself out from behind his\ntable, legs wobbly. 'I'm just coming!' He snatched up his cane and limped to\nthe front door, took a deep breath and fumbled with the latch.\nIt was not Frost, or Severard. Nor was it Goyle, or one of his freakish\nPracticals. It was someone much more unexpected. Glokta raised an\neyebrow, then leaned against the door frame. 'Major West, what a surprise.'\nSometimes, when old friends meet, things are instantly as they were all\nthose years before. The friendship resumes, untouched, as though there had\nbeen no interruption. Sometimes, but not now. 'Inquisitor Glokta,' mumbled\nWest—hesitant, awkward, embarrassed. 'I'm sorry to bother you so late.'\n'Don't mention it,' said Glokta with icy formality.\nThe Major nearly winced. 'May I come in?'\n'Of course.' Glokta shut the front door behind him, then limped after\nWest into his dining room. The Major squeezed himself into one of the\nchairs and Glokta took another. They sat there facing each other for a\nmoment, without speaking. What the hell does he want, at this hour or any\nother? Glokta scrutinised his old friend's face in the glow from the fire and\nthe one, flickering candle. Now that he could see him more clearly, he\nrealised West had changed. He looks old. His hair was thinning at the\ntemples, going grey round his ears. His face was pale, pinched, slightly\nhollow. He looks worried. Ground down. Close to the edge. West looked\nround at the mean room, the mean fire, the mean furniture, cautiously up at\nGlokta, then quickly down at the floor. Nervous, as if he had something\npicking at his mind. He looks ill at ease. As well he might.\nHe did not seem ready to break the silence, so Glokta did it for him. 'So,\nhow long has it been, eh? Apart from that night in town, and we can hardly\ncount that, can we?'\nThe memory of that unfortunate meeting hung between them for a"

Apart from that night in town, and we can hardly\ncount that, can we?'\nThe memory of that unfortunate meeting hung between them for a\nmoment like a fart, then West cleared his throat. 'Nine years.'\n'Nine years. Imagine that. Since we stood on the ridge, old friends\ntogether, looking down towards the river. Down towards the bridge and all\nthose Gurkish on the other side. Seems a lifetime ago, doesn't it? Nine\nyears. I can remember you pleading with me not to go down there, but I was\nhaving none of it. What a fool I was, eh? Thought I was our only hope.\nThought I was invincible.'\n'You saved us all that day, saved the whole army.'\n'Did I? How wonderful. I daresay if I'd died on that bridge there'd be\nstatues of me all over the place. Shame I didn't, really. Shame for everyone.'\nWest winced and shifted in his chair, looking ever more uncomfortable.\n'I looked for you, afterwards…' he mumbled.\nYou looked for me? How hugely fucking noble. What a true friend.\nPrecious little good it did me, dragged off in agony with my leg hacked to\nmincemeat. And that was just the beginning. 'You did not come to discuss\nold times, West.'\n'No… no, I didn't. I came about my sister.'\nGlokta paused. He had certainly not expected that answer. 'Ardee?'\n'Ardee, yes. I'm leaving for Angland soon and… I was hoping that,\nperhaps, you could keep an eye on her for me, while I'm away.' West's eyes\nflickered up nervously. 'You always had a way with women… Sand.' Glokta\ngrimaced at the sound of his first name. No one called him that anymore.\nNo one besides my mother. 'You always knew just what to say. Do you\nremember those three sisters? What were their names? You had them all\neating out of your hand.' West smiled, but Glokta couldn't.\nHe remembered, but the memories were weak now, colourless, faded.\nThe memories of another man. A dead man. My life began in Gurkhul, in\nthe Emperors prisons. The memories since then are much more real.\nStretched out in bed like a corpse after I came back, in the darkness,\nwaiting for friends who never came. He looked at West, and he knew that\nhis glance was terribly cold. Do you think to win me with your honest face\nand your talk of old times? Like a long-lost dog, at last come faithfully\nhome? I know better. You stink, West. You smell like betrayal. That memory\nat least is mine.\nGlokta leaned back slowly in his chair. 'Sand dan Glokta,' he murmured,\nas though recalling a name he once knew. 'Whatever became of him, eh,\nWest? You know, that friend of yours, that dashing young man, handsome,\nproud, fearless? Magic touch with the women? Loved and respected by all,\ndestined for great things? Wherever did he go?'\nWest looked back, puzzled and unsure of himself, and said nothing.\nGlokta lurched towards him, hands spread out on the table, lips curling"

'Dead! He died on the bridge! And what\nremains? A fucking ruin with his name! A limping, skulking shadow! A\ncrippled ghost, clinging to life the way the smell of piss clings to a beggar.\nHe has no friends, this loathsome fucking remnant, and he wants none! Get\nyou gone, West! Go back to Varuz, and to Luthar, and the rest of those\nempty bastards! There's no one here you know!' Glokta's lips trembled and\nspat with revulsion. He wasn't sure who disgusted him more—West, or\nhimself.\nThe Major blinked, his jaw muscles working silently. He got shakily to\nhis feet. 'I'm sorry,' he said, over his shoulder.\n'Tell me!' shouted Glokta, bringing him up short of the door. 'The rest of\nthem, they stuck to me so long as I was useful, so long as I was going up. I\nalways knew it. I wasn't so very surprised they wanted nothing to do with\nme when I came back. But you, West, I always thought you were a better\nfriend than that, a better man. I always thought that you at least—you alone\n—would come to visit me.' He shrugged. 'I suppose I was wrong.' Glokta\nturned away, frowning towards the fire, waiting for the sound of the front\ndoor closing.\n'She didn't tell you?'\nGlokta looked back. 'Who?'\n'Your mother.'\nHe snorted. 'My mother? Tell me what?'\n'I did come. Twice. As soon as I learned that you were back, I came.\nYour mother turned me away at the gates of your estate. She said that you\nwere too ill to take visitors, and that in any case you wanted nothing more\nto do with the army, and nothing more to do with me in particular. I came\nback again, a few months later. I thought I owed you that much. That time a\nservant came to see me off. Later I heard that you had joined the\nInquisition, and left for Angland. I put you out of my mind… until we\nmet… that night in the city…' West trailed off.\nIt took a while for his words to sink in, and by the time they had, Glokta\nrealised that his mouth was hanging open. So simple. No conspiracy. No\nweb of betrayal. He almost wanted to laugh at the stupidity of it. My mother\nturned him away at the gate, and I never thought to doubt that no one came.\nShe always hated West. A most unsuitable friend, far beneath her precious\nson. No doubt she blamed him for what happened to me. I should have\nguessed, but I was too busy wallowing in pain and bitterness. Too busy\nbeing tragic. He swallowed. 'You came?'\nWest shrugged. 'For what it's worth.'\nWell. What can we do, except try to do better? Glokta blinked, and took\na deep breath. Tm, er… I'm sorry. Forget what I said, if you can. Please. Sit"

You were saying something about your sister.'\n'Yes. Yes. My sister.' West fumbled his way back to his seat, looking\ndown at the floor, his face taking on that worried, guilty look again. 'We're\nleaving for Angland soon, and I don't know when I'll be back… or if, I\nsuppose… she'll be without any friends in the city and, well… I think you\nmet her once, when you came to our house.'\n'Of course, and a good deal more recently than that, in fact.'\n'You did?'\n'Yes. With our mutual friend, Captain Luthar.'\nWest turned even paler. There is something more to this than he is\ntelling me. But Glokta did not feel like putting his club foot through his one\nfriendship quite yet, not so soon after it had been reborn. He stayed quiet,\nand after a moment the Major went on.\n'Life has been… difficult for her. I could have done something. I should\nhave done something.' He stared miserably down at the table and an ugly\nspasm ran across his face. I know that one. One of my own favourites. Self-\nloathing. 'But I chose to let other things get in the way, and I did my best to\nforget all about it, and I pretended that everything was fine. She has\nsuffered and I am to blame.' He coughed, then swallowed awkwardly. His\nlip began to tremble and he covered his face with his hands. 'My fault… if\nsomething were to happen to her…' His shoulders shook silently, and\nGlokta raised his eyebrows. He was used to men crying in his presence of\ncourse. But I usually have at least to show them the instruments first.\n'Come on, Collem, this isn't like you.' He reached slowly across the\ntable, half pulled his hand back, and then patted his sobbing friend\nawkwardly on the shoulder. 'You've made some mistakes, but haven't we\nall? They're in the past, and can't be changed. There's nothing to be done\nnow except to do better, eh?' What? Can it really be me talking? Inquisitor\nGlokta, comforter of the needy? But West seemed reassured. He lifted his\nhead, wiped his runny nose, stared up hopefully at Glokta with wet eyes.\n'You're right, you're right, of course. I have to make amends. Have to!\nWill you help me, Sand? Will you look after her, while I'm gone?'\n'I'll do whatever I can for her, Collem, you can depend on me. I was\nonce proud to call you my friend and… I would be again.' Strange, but\nGlokta could almost feel a tear in his own eye. Me? Can it be? Inquisitor\nGlokta, trustworthy friend? Inquisitor Glokta, protector of vulnerable\nyoung women? He almost laughed out loud at the idea, and yet here he was.\nHe never would have thought that he needed one, but it felt good to have a\nfriend again.\n'Hollit,' said Glokta."

He chuckled to himself, the\nmemory filtering through a little clearer than before. 'They had a thing\nabout fencing. Loved it. Something about the sweat, maybe.'\n'I think that was when I decided to take it up.' West laughed, then\nscrewed up his face as if he was trying to remember something. 'What was\nour quartermaster's name? He had a thing for the youngest one, was out of\nhis mind with jealousy. What the hell was that man's name? Fat man.'\nThe name was not so very difficult for Glokta to recall. 'Rews. Salem\nRews.'\n'Rews, that's the one! I'd forgotten all about him. Rews! He could tell a\nstory like no one else, that man.

A memory like that stays with you. Roofs falling in,\nwindows cracking, crowds of fighters everywhere, all drunk on pain and\nwinning and, well, drink—looting, killing, setting fires, all the unpleasant\nrest of it. Women screaming, men shouting, stinking with smoke and fear.\nIn short, a sack, with him and Logen at the heart of it.\nBethod had put the fires out and made it his. Moved in, then started\nbuilding. He hadn't got far when he kicked Logen and the Dogman and the\nrest of them into exile, but they must have been building every day since. It\nwas twice as big now as it used to be, even before it got burned, covering\nthe whole hill and all the slope down to the river. Bigger than Uffrith.\nBigger than any city the Dogman had seen. From where he was, up in the\ntrees on the other side of the valley, you couldn't see the people, but there\nhad to be an awful lot of them in there. Three new roads leading out from\nthe gates. Two big new bridges. New buildings everywhere, and big ones\nwhere the small ones used to be. Lots of them. Built from stone, mostly,\nslate roofs, glass in some of the windows even.\n'They been busy,' said Threetrees.\n'New walls,' said Grim.\n'Lots of 'em,' muttered the Dogman. There were walls all over. There\nwas a big one round the outside, with proper towers and everything, and a\nbig ditch beyond it. There was an even bigger one round the top of the hill\nwhere Skarling's Hall used to stand. Huge great thing. Dogman could hardly\nwork out where they got all the stone for the building of it. 'Biggest damn\nwall I ever saw,' he said.\nThreetrees shook his head. 'I don't like it.

Someone's got to warn 'em about the Shanka. You\nknow it, chief. Who else is there?'\nThe old boy nodded to himself, slow as the sun rising. Taking his\nmoment, as always. 'Aye. Alright. Tell 'em I'm waiting here, by the old\nbridge. Tell 'em I'm alone. Just in case Bethod decides you're not welcome,\nyou understand?'\n'I get it. You're on your own, Threetrees. It was just the two of us made\nit back over the mountains.'\nThey'd all gathered now, and Forley smiled round at 'em. 'Well then,\nlads, it's been something ain't it?'\n'Shut up, Weakest,' scowled Dow. 'Bethod ain't got nothing against you.\nYou're coming back.'\n'In case I don't, though. It's been something.' The Dogman nodded to\nhim, awkward. It was the same dirty, scarred-up faces as usual, but grimmer\nthan ever. None of 'em liked letting one of their own put himself in danger,\nbut Forley was right, someone had to do it, and he was the best suited.\nSometimes weakness is a better shield than strength, the Dogman reckoned.\nBethod was an evil bastard, but he was a clever one. The Shanka were\ncoming, and he needed the warning. Hopefully, he'd be grateful for it.\nThey walked together, down to the edge of the trees, looking out\ntowards the path.

He squeezed Dogman's hand in his for a minute. 'To all of\nyou lads, eh?' and he turned and marched off towards the bridge, with his\nhead up high.\n'Luck, Forley!' shouted Black Dow, startling them all.\nHe turned round for a minute, the Weakest, stood on top of the bridge,\nand he grinned. Then he was gone.\nThreetrees took a deep breath. 'Weapons,' he said, 'just in case Bethod\ndon't want to hear sense. And wait for the signal, eh?'\nIt seemed a long time waiting, up in the leaves, staying quiet and still,\nlooking down at all them new walls. The Dogman lay on his belly, bow near\nat hand, watching, waiting, wondering how Forley was doing in there. A\nlong, tense time. Then he saw them. Horsemen coming out the nearest gate,\nriding over one of the new bridges, crossing the river. They'd got a cart at\nthe back. Dogman wasn't sure why they'd have a cart, but he didn't like it\nany. No sign of Forley, and he wasn't sure whether that was a good thing or\na bad.\nThey came quick, spurring up the side of the valley, up the steep path\ntowards the trees and the stream and the old stone bridge across it. Right at\nthe Dogman. He could hear the hooves thumping on the dirt. Close enough\nto count now, and take a good look at. Spears, shields and good armour.\nHelmets and mail. Ten of 'em, and two others sitting on the cart, either side\nof the driver, carrying some sorts of things that looked like little bows on\nblocks of wood. He didn't know what they were about, and he didn't like not\nknowing. He was the one wanted to be giving them the surprises.\nHe wriggled back through the brush on his stomach, sloshed through the\nstream and hurried to the edge of the trees, where he could get a good view\nof the old bridge. Threetrees, Tul and Dow were standing round the near\nside of it, and he waved over to them. Couldn't see Grim, he must've been\noff in the woods away beyond. He made the sign for horsemen, held up his\nfist to say ten, hand flat on his chest to say armour.\nDow took up his sword and axe, ran up into a bunch of broken rocks,\nhigh up beside the bridge, keeping low and quiet. Tul slid down the bank\ninto the stream, luckily no more than knee-deep right then, plastered his big\nself against the far side of the arch with his great long sword held up above\nthe water. Made the Dogman a bit nervous, he could see Tul so clear from\nwhere he was sitting. Still, the riders wouldn't see him at all if they came\nstraight up the path. They'd only be expecting one man alone, and Dogman\nhoped they wouldn't come too careful. He hoped, 'cause if they took the\ntime to check it'd be a fucking disaster.\nHe watched Threetrees strap his shield on his arm, draw his sword,"

He hoped, 'cause if they took the\ntime to check it'd be a fucking disaster.\nHe watched Threetrees strap his shield on his arm, draw his sword,\nstretch his neck out, then he just stood, waiting, big and solid, blocking the\npath on the near side of the bridge, seeming all alone in the world.\nThe Dogman could hear the hoof-beats loud now, and the clattering of\nthe cart's wheels out beyond the trees. He pulled out a few arrows and\nplanted them in the earth, point down, where he could get to 'em quick.\nDoing his best to swallow his fear. His fingers were shaking all the while,\nbut that didn't matter. They'd work alright when they needed to.\n'Wait for the signal,' he whispered to himself. 'Wait for the signal.'\nHe nocked a shaft to his bow and half-drew the string, taking aim down\ntowards the bridge. Damn it but he needed to piss bad.\nThe first spear-point showed itself over the crest of the hill, then others.\nBobbing helmets, mailed chests, horses' faces, bit by bit the riders came up\ntowards the bridge. The cart rolled behind, with its driver and its two funny\npassengers, pulled by a big shaggy carthorse.\nThe rider up front saw Threetrees now, waiting for him, over the hump\nof the bridge, and he spurred on forward. The Dogman breathed a little\neasier as the others trotted after him in a clump, all eagerness. Forley\nmust've said as he was told—they were expecting only one. Dogman could\nsee Tul peering up from underneath the mossy arch as the horses clopped\nabove him. By the dead, his hands were shaking. He was worried he'd let\nthe arrow fly half-drawn and ruin the whole thing.\nThe cart stopped on the far bank, the two men on it stood up and\npointed their strange bows at Threetrees. The Dogman got himself a nice\naim on one of 'em, and drew the string back all the way. Most of the riders\nwere on the bridge by now, horses shying and stirring about, unhappy at\nbeing packed in so tight. The one at the front reined up in front of\nThreetrees, spear pointing at him. The old boy didn't back away a step,\nthough. Not him. He just frowned up, not giving the riders any room to get\naround him, keeping 'em choked up on the bridge.\n'Well, well,' the Dogman heard their leader saying. 'Rudd Threetrees.\nWe thought you was long dead, old man.' He knew the voice. One of\nBethod's Carls, from way back. Bad-Enough they called him.\n'Reckon I've got a fight or two left in me,' said Threetrees, still giving no\nground.\nBad-Enough took a look about him, squinting into the trees, sense\nenough to see he was in a poor position, but not too careful. 'Where's the\nrest of you? Where's that fucker Dow, eh?'\nThreetrees shrugged. 'There's just me.'\n'Back to the mud, eh?' The Dogman could just see Bad-Enough grinning\nunder his helmet. 'Shame. Hoped I'd be the one to kill that dirty bastard.'"

Hoped I'd be the one to kill that dirty bastard.'\nDogman winced, half expecting Dow to come flying out of those rocks\nright then, but there was no sign of him. Not yet. Waiting for the signal, for\nonce.\n'Where's Bethod?' asked Threetrees.\n'The King don't come out for the likes of you! Anyhow, he's off in\nAngland, kicking the Union's arses. Prince Calder's taking care of things\nwhile he's gone.'\nThreetrees snorted. 'Prince is it, now? I remember him sucking on his\nmother's tit. He could scarcely do that right.'\n'A lot's changed, old man. All kind of things.'\nBy the dead, Dogman was wishing they'd get on with it, one way or\nanother. He could hardly keep the piss in. 'Wait for the signal,' he was\nmouthing to himself, just to try and keep his hands steady.\n'The Flatheads are everywhere,' Threetrees was saying. 'They'll be\ncoming south by next summer, sooner maybe. Something needs doing.'\n'Well, why don't you come with us, eh? You can warn Calder yourself.\nWe brought a cart, for you to ride in. Man of your age shouldn't have to\nwalk.' A couple of the other riders laughed at that, but Threetrees didn't join\n'em.\n'Where's Forley?' he growled. 'Where's the Weakest?'\nThere was more sniggering from the horsemen. 'Oh, he's nearby,' said\nBad-Enough, 'he's real close. Why don't you get in the cart, and we'll take\nyou right to him. Then we can all sit round and talk about Flatheads, nice\nand peaceful.'\nThe Dogman didn't like this. Not at all. He'd got a nasty feeling. 'You\nmust take me for some new kind o' fool,' said Threetrees. 'I'm going\nnowhere 'til I've seen Forley.'\nBad-Enough frowned at that. 'You're in no state to be telling us what\nyou'll do. You might have been the big man once, but you're come to less\nthan nothing, and that's a fact. Now give up your blade and get in the\nfucking cart like I told you, before I lose my temper.'\nHe tried to nudge his horse forward again but Threetrees wasn't\nbudging. 'Where's Forley?' he growled. 'And I'll have a straight answer or\nI'll have your guts.'\nBad-Enough grinned over his shoulder at his mates, and they grinned\nback. 'Alright, old man, since you're asking. Calder wanted us to wait for\nthis, but I've got to see the look on your face. The Weakest's in the cart.\nLeastways, most of him is.' He smiled and let something drop from his\nsaddle. A canvas sack, with something in it. Dogman could guess already\nwhat it was. It hit the ground near Threetrees' feet. The something rolled\nout, and the Dogman could see on the old boy's face that he'd guessed right.\nForley's head."

The something rolled\nout, and the Dogman could see on the old boy's face that he'd guessed right.\nForley's head.\nWell that was it, o' course. Fuck the signal. Dogman's first arrow stuck\none of the men on the cart right through his chest, and he screamed and\ntumbled over into the back, dragging the driver with him. It was a good\nshot, but there was no time to think on that, he was far too busy fumbling\nfor another arrow, and shouting. Didn't even know what he was shouting,\njust that he was. Grim must've been shooting as well, one of the Carls on\nthe bridge gave a yell, fell off his horse and splashed into the stream.\nThreetrees was down in a crouch, hiding behind his shield, backing off\nwhile Bad-Enough prodded at him with his spear, kicking his horse off the\nbridge and onto the path on our side.\nThe rider behind pushed around the side of him, keen to get off the\nbridge, coming close beside the rocks.\n'Fucking bastards!' Dow flew out of the stones above him, barrelled into\nthe rider. They tumbled down together, a mess of limbs and weapons, but\nthe Dogman could see that Dow was on top. His axe went up and down a\ncouple of times, quick. One less to worry on.\nDogman's second arrow went well wide of the mark, he was so busy\nshouting his head off, but it stuck one of the horses in the rump, and that\nturned out better than anything. It started rearing and thrashing about, and\nsoon all the horses were milling and crying while their riders cursed and\nbumbled around, spears going every which way, noise and mess on all\nsides.\nThe horseman at the back split in half, all of a sudden, blood spraying\neverywhere. The Thunderhead had come up from the stream, got round\nbehind them. There's no armour that could stop a blow like that. The giant\nroared and swung the great length of bloody metal over his head again. The\nnext in line got his shield up in time, but he might as well not have\nbothered. The blade hacked a big chunk out of it, tore his head open and\nhammered him out of the saddle. The blow was that strong it clubbed the\nhorse down too.\nOne of them had got his mount turned now, bringing up his spear to stab\nat Tul from the side. Before he could he grunted and jerked, arching his\nback. Dogman could see the feathers sticking from his side. Grim must've\nshot him, and he tumbled down. His foot caught in the stirrup and he hung\nthere, swinging. He was groaning and moaning and trying to right himself,\nbut his horse was plunging now along with the others, making him dance,\nwrong way up, smacking his head against the side of the bridge. He\ndropped his spear in the stream, tried to pull himself up, then his horse half\nlanded a kick on his shoulder and knocked him free. He went down under\nthe milling hooves and the Dogman paid him no more mind.\nThe second archer was still sitting up on the cart. He was getting over"

He was getting over\nhis shock now, and lining up his funny bow on Threetrees, still squatting\ndown behind his shield. Dogman shot at him but he was hurrying, and\nyelling, and his shaft missed and hit the driver beside him in his shoulder,\njust got up from the back of the cart, knocked him back down again.\nThe weird bow twanged and Threetrees jerked back from his shield. The\nDogman was worried for a minute, then he saw that the arrow split the\nheavy wood and punched on through, but stopped just short of catching\nThreetrees in the face. It was lodged there through his shield, feathers\nsticking out one side, point out the other. That's an evil little bow, Dogman\nthought.\nHe heard Tul roar and saw another rider fly off into the stream. Another\ndropped with one of Grim's arrows in his back. Dow turned and chopped\nthe back legs out from under Bad-Enough's horse with his sword, and it\nstumbled and slid, pitching him off onto the ground. The last couple were\ntrapped. Dow and Threetrees at one end of the bridge, Tul at the other, too\ntight with frightened, riderless horses for them to turn around or nothing, at\nthe mercy of Grim out in the woods. He wasn't in a merciful mood, it\nseemed, and it didn't take him long to pick 'em off.\nThe one with the bow tried to make a break for it, chucking his bit of\nwood away and jumping down from the cart. Dogman thought nice and\ncareful about his aiming this time, and his shaft got the archer right between\nthe shoulders and knocked him on his face before he could get more than a\nfew paces. He had a go at crawling, but he wasn't crawling far. The driver\nof the cart showed his face again, groaning and grabbing at the arrow in his\nshoulder. The Dogman didn't usually kill men that were down, but he\nreckoned today was an exception. His arrow got the driver through the\nmouth, and that was him dealt with.\nDogman could see one of the riders limping away, one of Grim's arrows\nin his leg, and lined him up with his last shaft. Threetrees got there first\nthough, and stuck him through the back with his sword. There was another\none still moving, struggling up to his knees, and the Dogman took an aim\non him. Before he could loose, Dow stepped up and hacked his head off.\nBlood everywhere. Horses still milling, screaming, slipping on the slick\nstones of the bridge.\nDogman could see Bad-Enough now, the last one going. He must've lost\nhis helmet when he fell off his horse. He was struggling in the stream on his\nhands and knees, slowed up by all that weight of mail. He'd dropped his\nshield, and his spear, to make better time running for it, but he hadn't\nrealised he was coming right at the Dogman.\n'Get him alive!' shouted Threetrees. Tul set off down one bank, but he\nwas making slow progress, slipping and sliding in the mud the cart churned"

Bad-Enough was close now. The Dogman could hear his scared\ngasping as he struggled down the stream.\n'Aah!' he howled as Dogman's arrow thudded into his leg, just below the\nbottom of his mail coat. He toppled sideways onto the bank, blood leaking\ninto the muddy water. He started dragging himself up the wet turf beside the\nstream.\n'That's it, Dogman,' shouted Threetrees. 'Alive!'\nThe Dogman slid out the trees and down the bank, through the water.\nHe pulled his knife out. Tul and Dow were still a little ways off, hurrying\ntowards him. Bad-Enough rolled over in the mud, his face screwed up with\nthe pain of the arrow in his leg. He held his hands up. 'Alright, alright, I'll\ngurrr—'\n'You'll what?' asked the Dogman, looking down at him.\n'Gurrr—' he said again, looking mightily surprised, hand gripped to his\nneck. There was blood pouring out between his fingers, down the front of\nhis wet mail.\nDow splashed up beside them and stood there, looking down. 'Well\nthat's the end of that,' he said.\n'What you do that for?' shouted Threetrees, hurrying over.\n'Eh?' asked the Dogman. Then he looked down at his knife. It was all\nbloody. 'Ah.' That's when he saw it was him as had cut Bad-Enough's throat.\n'We could have asked him questions!' said Threetrees. 'He could have\ntook a message back to Calder, told him who did this, and why!'\n'Wake up, chief,' muttered Tul Duru, already wiping his sword down.\n'No one cares a shit for the old ways no more. Besides, they'll be after us\nsoon enough. No point letting 'em know more than we have to.'\nDow clapped the Dogman on the shoulder. 'You were right to do it. This\nbastard's head'll do for a message.' Dogman wasn't sure Dow's approval was\nsomething he was after, but it was a bit late now. It took Dow a couple of\nchops to get Bad-Enough's head off. He carried it, swinging by its hair, with\nas little care or worry as he'd carry a bag of turnips. He grabbed a spear out\nof the stream on his way, found a spot he liked.\n'Things ain't the way they used to be,' Threetrees was muttering as he\nstrode off down the bank towards the bridge, where Grim was already\npicking over the bodies.\nThe Dogman followed him, watching Dow stick Bad-Enough's head on\nthe spear, shoving the blunt end into the ground, stepping back, hands on\nhips, to admire his work. He shifted it a bit to the right, then back to the left,\nuntil he'd got it nice and straight. He grinned over at the Dogman.\n'Perfect,' he said.\n'What now, chief?' Tul was asking. 'What now?'"

Tul,\nyou better unhitch that carthorse, he's the only one as'll carry you.'\n'South?' asked the Thunderhead, looking confused, 'south to where?'\n'Angland.'\n'Angland?' asked the Dogman, and he could tell they were all thinking\nit. 'For what? Ain't they fighting down there?'\n'Course they are, that's why I've a mind to go.'\nDow frowned. 'Us? What have we got against the Union?'\n'No, fool,' said Threetrees, 'I've a mind to fight along with 'em.'\n'With the Union?' asked Tul, his lip curling up, 'with those bloody\nwomen? That ain't our fight, chief.'\n'Any fight against Bethod is my fight now. I mean to see the end of\nhim.' Once he'd thought on it, the Dogman had never yet seen Threetrees\nchange his mind. Never once. 'Who's with me?' he asked.\nThey all were. Course.\nIt was raining. Thin rain, making the whole world damp. Soft as a maiden's\nkiss, as they say, though the Dogman could hardly remember what one of\nthose felt like. Rain. Seemed right somehow, for the occasion. Dow was\ndone with piling the dirt, and he sniffed and dug the spade down into the\nearth beside the grave.\nIt was a long way from the road. A good long way. They didn't want no\none finding it and digging Forley up. They all gathered round, just five now,\nlooking down. It was a long time since they'd had anyone to bury among\nthem. The Shanka got Logen o' course, not too long ago, but they never had\nfound the body. There might have been just one less in the band, but it\nseemed to the Dogman like there was a lot missing.\nThreetrees frowned, taking a moment, thinking out what to say. It was\njust as well he was the chief, and had to find the words, 'cause Dogman\ndidn't reckon he could have found a thing. After a minute Threetrees started\nspeaking, slow as the light fading at sunset.\n'This was a weak man, here. The Weakest, that's a fact. That was his\nname, and ain't that a joke? To call a man the Weakest. The worst fighter\nthey could find, to surrender to Ninefingers. Weak fighter, no doubt, but\nstrong heart, say I.'\n'Aye,' said Grim.\n'Strong heart,' said Tul Duru.\n'The strongest,' mumbled the Dogman.

They all did.\n'That's all I've got to say. Back to the mud with you, Forley. We're the\npoorer, and the ground's the richer for it.'\nDow knelt down, and set his hand on the fresh-turned soil. 'Back to the\nmud,' he said. The Dogman thought for a minute there might be a tear\ndripping off his nose, but it had to be only the rain. This was Black Dow,\nafter all. He got up and walked away with his head down and the others\nfollowed him, one by one, off toward the horses.\n'Fare you well, Forley,' said the Dogman.

She was\nalways there when he arrived, at whatever spot had been arranged. He didn't\nlike having to wait for her one bit. He always had to wait for her letters, and\nthat rankled as it was. Standing here like an idiot, it made him feel even\nmore of a slave than he did already.\nHe frowned up at the grey skies. There were a few spots of rain falling,\njust to match his mood. He felt one from time to time, a tiny pin-prick on\nhis face. He could see the drops making circles in the grey surface of the\nlake, making pale streaks against the green of the trees, the grey of the\nbuildings. The dark shape of the House of the Maker was rendered hazy by\nthem. He frowned at that building with particular displeasure.\nHe hardly knew what to make of it now. The whole thing had been like\nsome feverish nightmare and, like a nightmare, he had decided simply to\nignore it, and pretend it never happened. He might have succeeded too,\nexcept that the bloody thing was always looming on the edge of his vision,\nwhenever he stepped out of the door, reminding him the world was full of\nmysteries he did not understand, seething just below the surface.\n'Damn it,' he muttered, 'and damn that lunatic, Bayaz, as well.'\nHe frowned across the damp lawns. The rain was keeping people away\nfrom the park, and it was emptier than he had seen it in a long time. A\ncouple of sad-looking men sat listlessly on benches, nursing their own\npersonal tragedies, and there were passers-by on the paths, hurrying from\nsomewhere to wherever. One was coming towards him now, wrapped up in\na long cloak.\nJezal's frown vanished. It was her, he could tell. She had her hood\npulled right down over her face.

There was a great purple bruise across her\ncheek, around her eye, the corner of her mouth! He stood there frozen for a\nmoment, wishing, stupidly, that he was hurt instead of her. The pain would\nhave been less. He realised he'd clamped one hand over his mouth, eyes\nbulging like a nervous little girl at a spider in the bath, but he couldn't stop\nhimself.\nArdee only scowled. 'What? Did you never see a bruise before?'\n'Well, yes, but… are you alright?'\n'Of course I am.' She stepped around him and started walking off down\nthe path. He had to hurry to catch her up. 'It's nothing. I fell is all. I'm a\nclumsy fool. Always have been. All my life.' She said it with some\nbitterness, it seemed to him.\n'Is there anything I can do?'\n'What could you do? Kiss it better?' If they'd been alone he wouldn't\nhave minded trying, but her frown showed him what she thought of that\nidea. It was strange: the bruises should have repelled him, but they didn't.\nNot at all. Rather, he had an almost overpowering urge to take her in his\narms, to stroke her hair, to murmur soothing words. Pathetic. Probably she\nwould slap him if he tried. Probably he would deserve it. She didn't need his\nhelp. Besides, he couldn't touch her. There were people around, damn them,\neyes everywhere. You never knew who might be watching. The thought\nmade him more than a little nervous.\n'Ardee… aren't we taking a risk? I mean, what if your brother were to—'\nShe snorted. 'Forget about him. He won't do anything. I've told him to\nkeep his nose out of my business.' Jezal had to smile. He imagined that\nmust have been quite an amusing scene. 'Besides, I hear that you're all\nleaving for Angland on the next tide, and I could hardly let you go without\nsaying goodbye, now could I?'\n'I wouldn't have done that!' he said, horrified again. It hurt just hearing\nher say the word goodbye. 'I mean, well, I'd have let them sail without me\nbefore I would've done that!'\n'Huh.'\nThey walked along in silence for a moment, skirting the lake, both with\ntheir eyes on the gravel. It was hardly the bitter-sweet farewell that he had\npictured so far. Just bitter. They passed among the trunks of some willow\ntrees, their branches trailing in the water below. It was a secluded spot,\nscreened from prying eyes. Jezal reckoned he was unlikely to find one\nbetter for what he had to say. He glanced sideways at her, and took a deep\nbreath.\n'Ardee, er, I don't know how long we'll be away. I mean, I suppose it"

I mean, I suppose it\ncould be months…' He chewed at his top lip. It was not coming out at all as\nhe had hoped. He had practised this speech twenty times at least, staring in\nhis mirror until he got just the right expression: serious, confident, slightly\nwheedling. Now, though, the words came out in a foolish rush. 'I hope that,\nI mean, perhaps, I hope that you'll wait for me?'\n'I daresay I'll still be here. I've nothing else to do. But don't worry, you'll\nhave a lot to think about in Angland—war, honour, glory and all that. You'll\nsoon forget about me.'\n'No!' he shouted, catching hold of her arm. 'No I won't!' He pulled his\nhand away quickly, worried someone might see. At least she was looking at\nhim now, somewhat surprised, maybe, at how fierce his denial had been—\nthough not half as surprised as he was.\nJezal blinked down at her. A pretty girl certainly, but too dark, too\ntanned, too clever by half, simply dressed with no jewels, and with a great\nugly bruise across her face. She would hardly have excited much comment\nin the officer's mess. How was it that she seemed to him the most beautiful\nwoman in the world? The Princess Terez was an unwashed dog beside her.\nThe clever words leaked out of his mind and he spoke without thinking,\nlooking her straight in the eye. Maybe this was what honesty felt like.\n'Look, Ardee, I know you think I'm an ass and, well, I daresay I am, but\nI don't plan always to be one. I don't know why you even look at me, and I\ndon't know much about this sort of thing but, well… I think about you all\nthe time. I hardly think about anything else any more.' He took another deep\nbreath. 'I think…' He glanced around again, just to check that no one was\nwatching. 'I think I love you!'\nShe spluttered with laughter. 'You really are an ass,' she said. Despair.\nHe was utterly crushed. He couldn't breathe for disappointment. His face\nscrewed up, his head drooped and he stared down at the ground. There were\ntears in his eyes. Actual tears. Pitiful. 'But I'll wait.' Joy. It swelled in his\nchest and burst out in a little girlish sob. He was helpless. It was ridiculous\nthe power she had over him. The difference between misery and happiness\nwas the right word from her. She laughed again. 'Look at you, you fool.'\nShe reached up and touched his face, rubbed a tear from his cheek with\nher thumb. 'I'll wait,' she said, and she smiled at him. That crooked smile.\nThe people had faded, the park, the city, the world. Jezal stared down at\nArdee, for how long he could not have said, trying to stamp every detail of\nher face into his mind. He had a feeling, for some reason, that the memory\nof that smile might have to get him through a lot."

He had a feeling, for some reason, that the memory\nof that smile might have to get him through a lot.\nThe docks were heaving with activity, even for the docks. The wharves\nboiled with people, the air shook and rattled with their din. Soldiers and\nsupplies poured endlessly up the slippery gangways and onto the ships.\nCrates were hauled, barrels were rolled, hundreds of horses were dragged\nand pushed and kicked aboard, eyes bulging, mouths frothing. Men grunted\nand groaned, heaved at wet ropes, strained at wet beams, sweating and\nshouting in the spitting rain, slipping around on the slick decks, running\nhere and there in epic confusion.\nEverywhere people embraced, kissed, waved to each other. Wives\nsaying goodbye to husbands, mothers to sons, children to fathers, all\nequally bedraggled. Some put a brave face on it, some wept and wailed.\nOthers did not care: spectators come simply to witness the madness.\nIt all meant nothing to Jezal, leaning on the weathered rail of the ship\nthat would carry him to Angland. He was sunk in a terrible gloom, nose\nrunning, hair plastered to his scalp with wet. Ardee was not there, and yet\nshe was everywhere. He would hear her voice above the din, calling his\nname. He would glimpse her out of the corner of his eye, looking at him,\nand his breath would catch in his throat. He would smile, half-raise his hand\nto wave, then he would see it was not her. Some other dark-haired woman,\nsmiling at some other soldier. His shoulders would slump again. Each time\nthe disappointment was sharper.\nHe realised now that he had made a terrible mistake. Why the hell had\nhe asked her to wait for him? Wait for what? He could not marry her, that\nwas a fact. Impossible. But the thought of her even looking at another man\nmade him feel sick. He was wretched.\nLove. He hated to admit it, but it had to be. He had always regarded the\nwhole notion with contempt. A stupid word. A word for bad poets to harp\non, and foolish women to chatter about. A thing found in childish stories\nand with no relevance to the real world, where relationships between men\nand women were simple matters of fucking and money. Yet here he was,\nmired in a horrible bog of fear and guilt, lust and confusion, loss and pain.\nLove. What a curse.\n'I'd like to see Ardee,' murmured Kaspa, wistfully.\nJezal turned to stare at him. 'What? What did you say?'\n'It's quite a sight to see,' said the Lieutenant, holding his hands up, 'that's\nall.' Everyone was a little careful around him since that card game, as if he\nmight blow up at any moment.\nJezal turned sullenly back to the crowds. There was some kind of a\ncommotion down below them. A single horseman was forcing his way\nthrough the chaos, spurring a well-lathered horse with frequent shouts of\n'Move!' Even in the rain, the wings on the rider's helmet glittered.

He was indeed making directly for their\nship, leaving a trail of bemused and angry soldiers and workmen behind\nhim. He swung out of the saddle and strode purposefully up the gangplank\ntowards them, face grim, bright-polished armour covered with moisture and\njingling with every step.\n'Captain Luthar?' he asked.\n'Yes,' said Jezal, 'I'll fetch the Colonel.'\n'No need. My message is for you.'\n'It is?'\n'High Justice Marovia requires your presence at his offices.\nImmediately. It would be best if you took my mount.'\nJezal frowned. He did not like the taste of this at all. There was no\nreason that he could see for a Knight Herald to be bringing messages to\nhim, except that he had been inside the House of the Maker. He wanted\nnothing more to do with that. He wanted it in the past, forgotten, along with\nBayaz, and his Northman, and that disgusting cripple.\n'The High Justice is waiting, Captain.'\n'Yes, of course.' It seemed there was nothing to be done.\n'Ah, Captain Luthar! An honour to see you again!' Jezal was hardly\nsurprised to run into the madman Sulfur, even here outside the offices of the\nHigh Justice. He no longer even seemed a madman, just another part of a\nworld gone entirely mad. 'An absolute honour!' he frothed.\n'Likewise,' said Jezal numbly.\n'I'm so lucky I caught you, what with both of us leaving so soon! My\nmaster has all manner of errands for me.' He gave a deep sigh. 'Never the\nslightest peace, eh?'\n'No, I know what you mean.'\n'Still, an honour indeed to see you, and victorious at the Contest! I saw\nthe whole thing, you know, it was a privilege to bear witness.' He smiled\nbroadly, different coloured eyes glittering. 'And to think, you were set on\ngiving it up. Hah! But you stuck at it, just as I said you would! Yes you did,\nand now you reap the rewards! The edge of the World,' he whispered softly,\nas though to say the words out loud was to invite disaster. 'The edge of the\nWorld. Can you imagine? I envy you, indeed I do!'\nJezal blinked. 'What?'\n'What! Hah! \"What\", he says! You are dauntless, sir! Dauntless!' And\nSulfur strode off across the wet Square of Marshals, chuckling to himself.\nJezal was so bemused that he had not even the presence of mind to call him\na damn idiot once he was out of earshot.\nOne of Marovia's many clerks ushered him through an empty, echoing\nhallway towards a pair of enormous doors. He stopped before them,\nknocked. At an answering cry he turned the handle and pulled one of the\ndoors back, standing aside politely for Jezal to pass through.\n'You may go in,' he said quietly, after they had been stood there for a\nwhile.\n'Yes, yes, of course.'\nThe cavernous chamber beyond was eerily silent.

Furniture was\nstrangely sparse in that huge, panelled space, and what there was seemed\noversized, as though for the use of people much bigger than Jezal. It gave\nhim the distinct feeling that he was arriving at his own trial.\nHigh Justice Marovia sat behind an enormous table, its surface polished\nto mirror brightness, smiling at Jezal with a kindly, if slightly pitying\nexpression. Marshal Varuz was seated to his left, staring down guiltily at his\nown blurry reflection. Jezal had not thought he could feel more depressed,\nbut on seeing the third member of the group he realised he had been wrong.\nBayaz, wearing a self-satisfied smirk. He felt a mild surge of panic as the\ndoor shut behind him: the clicking of the latch felt like the clank of the\nheavy bolt on a prison cell.\nBayaz started up from his chair and came round the table. 'Captain\nLuthar, I am so glad you could join us.' The old man took Jezal's damp hand\nin both of his and squeezed it firmly, leading him forward into the room.\n'Thank you for coming. Thank you indeed.'\n'Er, of course.' As if he had been given a choice.\n'Well now, you're probably wondering what this is all about. Allow me\nto explain.' He stepped back and perched on the edge of the table, like a\nkindly uncle holding forth to a child. 'I and a few brave companions—\nchosen people, you understand, people of quality—are engaging on a great\njourney! An epic voyage! A grand adventure! I have little doubt that, should\nwe be successful, there will be stories told of this for years to come. Very\nmany years.' Bayaz' forehead crinkled as he raised his white eyebrows.\n'Well? What do you think?'\n'Er…' Jezal glanced nervously over at Marovia and Varuz, but they were\ngiving no clues as to what was going on. 'If I may?'\n'Of course, Jezal—I may call you Jezal, may I?'\n'Yes, er, well, yes, I suppose. Er, the thing is… I was wondering what all\nthis has to do with me?'\nBayaz smiled. 'We are short a man.'\nThere was a long, heavy silence. A drop of water trickled down Jezal's\nscalp, dripped from his hair, ran down his nose and pattered against the tiles\nbeneath his feet. Horror crept slowly through his body, from his gut to the\nvery tips of his fingers. 'Me?' he croaked.\n'The road will be a long and difficult one, most likely beset with\ndangers. We have enemies out there, you and I. More enemies than you\nwould believe. Who could be more useful than a proven swordsman, such\nas yourself? The winner of the Contest, no less!'\nJezal swallowed. 'I appreciate the offer, really I do, but I am afraid I\nmust decline. My place is with the army, you understand.' He took a\nhesitant step back towards the door. 'I must go north.

'You need not concern yourself with that\nany longer. You will not be going to Angland.'\n'But, your Worship, my company—'\n'Will find another commander,' smiled the High Justice: understanding,\nsympathetic, but horribly firm. 'I appreciate your feelings, indeed I do, but\nwe consider this more urgent. It is important that the Union be represented\nin this matter.'\n'Terribly important,' murmured Varuz, half-heartedly. Jezal blinked at\nthe three old men. There was no escape. So this was his reward for winning\nthe Contest? Some crackpot voyage to who-knew-where in the company of\na demented old man and a pack of savages? How he wished now that he\nhad never started fencing! That he had never even seen a steel in his life!\nBut wishing was useless. There was no way back.\n'I need to serve my country—' mumbled Jezal.\nBayaz laughed. 'There are other ways to serve your country, my boy,\nthan being one corpse in a pile, up there in the frozen North. We leave\ntomorrow.'\n'Tomorrow? But my things are—'\n'Don't worry, Captain,' and the old man slipped off the table and clapped\nhim enthusiastically on the shoulder, 'everything is arranged. Your boxes\nwere brought off the ship before it left. You have this evening to pick out\nsome things for our journey, but we must travel light. Weapons, of course,\nand stout clothes for travelling. Make sure you pack a good pair of boots,\neh? No uniforms, I'm afraid, they might attract the wrong kind of attention\nwhere we're going.'\n'No, of course,' said Jezal miserably. 'Might I ask… where are we\ngoing?'\n'The edge of the World, my boy, the edge of the World!' Bayaz' eyes\ntwinkled. 'And back, of course… I hope.'\nThe Bloody-Nine\n« ^ »\nSay one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say that he's happy. They were\nleaving, at last. Beyond some vague talk about the Old Empire, and the\nedge of the World, he had no idea where they were going and he didn't care.\nAnywhere but this cursed place would do for him, and the sooner the better.\nThe latest member of the group didn't seem to share his good spirits.\nLuthar, the proud young man from the gate. The one who'd won the sword-\ngame, thanks to Bayaz' cheating. He'd barely said two words together since\nhe arrived. Just stood there, face rigid and chalky pale, staring out of the\nwindow, bolt upright like he had a spear all the way up his arse.\nLogen ambled over to him.

Trust is what binds a band\ntogether, and out there in the wilds that can make the difference between\nliving or dying. Building that kind of trust takes time, and effort. Logen\nreckoned it was best to get started early, and today he had good humour to\nspare, so he stood next to Luthar and looked out at the park, trying to dream\nup some common ground in which to plant the seeds of an unlikely\nfriendship.\n'Beautiful, your home.' He didn't think it was, but he was short on ideas.\nLuthar turned from the window, looked Logen haughtily up and down.\n'What would you know about it?'\n'I reckon one man's thoughts are worth about as much as another's.'\n'Huh,' sneered the young man coldly. 'Then I suppose that's where we\ndiffer.' He turned back to the view.\nLogen took a deep breath. The trust might be a while coming. He\nabandoned Luthar and tried Quai instead, but the apprentice was scarcely\nmore promising: slumped in a chair, frowning at nothing.\nLogen sat down next to him. 'Aren't you looking forward to going\nhome?'\n'Home,' mumbled the apprentice listlessly.\n'That's right, the Old Empire… or wherever.'\n'You don't know what it's like there.'\n'You could tell me,' said Logen, hoping to hear something about the\npeaceful valleys, cities, rivers and whatnot.\n'Bloody. It's bloody there, and lawless, and life is cheap as dirt.'\nBloody and lawless. That all had an unpleasantly familiar smack to it.\n'Isn't there an Emperor, or something?'\n'There are many, always making war on one another, forging alliances\nthat last a week, or a day, or an hour, before they scramble to be first to stab\neach other in the back. When one Emperor falls another rises, and another,\nand another, and meanwhile the hopeless and the dispossessed scavenge and\nloot and kill on the fringes. The cities dwindle, the great works of the past\nfall into ruin, the crops go unharvested and the people go hungry.\nBloodshed and betrayal, hundreds of years of it. The feuds have become so\ndeep, so complicated, that few can tell any longer who hates who, and no\none can say why. There's no need for reasons any more.'\nLogen made one last effort. 'You never know. Things might have got\nbetter.'\n'Why?' muttered the apprentice. 'Why?'\nLogen was fumbling for a reply when one of the doors swung briskly\nopen. Bayaz frowned around the room. 'Where's Maljinn?'\nQuai swallowed. 'She left.'\n'I can see she left! I thought I told you to keep her here!'\n'You didn't tell me how,' muttered the apprentice.\nHis master ignored him. 'What the hell has become of that bloody\nwoman? We must be away by noon! Three days I've known her, and she\nalready has me at the end of my rope!' He clenched his teeth and took a\ndeep breath. 'Find her, will you Logen? Find her and bring her back.'"

You can kick her all the way\nback here as far as I'm concerned!'\nEasy to say, but Logen didn't fancy trying it. Still, if it had to be done\nbefore they could leave, it was best done now. He sighed, got up from his\nchair and made for the door.\nLogen pressed himself into the shadows by the wall, watching.\n'Shit,' he whispered to himself. It would have to be now, just as they\nwere about to leave. Ferro was twenty strides away, standing up tall with a\ndeeper than usual scowl on her dark face. There were three men gathered\nround her. Masked men, all in black. Their sticks were down by their legs,\nbehind their backs, kept half out of sight, but Logen had no doubt about\nwhat they had in mind. He could hear one of them talking, hissing through\nhis mask, something about coming quietly. He winced. Coming quietly\ndidn't sound like Ferro's style.\nHe wondered whether he should slip away and tell the others. He\ncouldn't really say he liked the woman much, not near enough to get his\nhead broken for her. But if he left them to it, three against one, the chances\nwere they'd have knocked her to pieces by the time he got back, however\ntough she was, and dragged her off to who knew where. He might never get\nout of this damn city then.\nHe started judging the distance, thinking about how best to go at them,\nweighing his chances, but he'd been too long doing nothing, and his mind\nmoved slowly. He was still working on it when Ferro suddenly jumped on\none of them, yelling at the top of her voice, knocking him on his back. She\ngave him a couple of vicious-looking punches in the face before the others\ncaught hold of her and dragged her up.\n'Shit,' hissed Logen. The three of them wrestled, lurching around in the\nlane, knocking against the walls, grunting and swearing, kicking and\npunching, a tangle of flailing limbs. It seemed that time had run out for a\nclever approach. Logen gritted his teeth and charged towards them.\nThe one on the floor had rolled to his feet, shaking the fuzz out of his\nhead while the other two struggled to get a good grip on Ferro. Now he\nlifted his stick high, arching back, ready to smash her on the skull. Logen\nlet go a roar. The masked face snapped round, surprised-looking.\n'Huh?' Then Logen's shoulder crunched into his ribs, lifting him off his\nfeet and sending him sprawling. Out of the corner of his eye he saw\nsomeone swing a stick at him, but he'd got them offguard and there was no\nreal force behind it.

Logen grabbed\nhim by two fistfuls of his black coat, hauled him into the air and flung him\nupsidedown into the wall.\nHe bounced off with a gurgle and crumpled on the cobbles. Logen spun\nround, fists clenched, but the last one was lying on his face with Ferro on\ntop of him, one knee jammed into his back, pulling his head up by the hair\nand smashing his face into the road, shouting meaningless curses all the\nwhile.\n'What did you fucking do?' he shouted, grabbing her under the elbow\nand dragging her off.\nShe tore free of his grip and stood there panting, fists bunched up by her\nsides, blood leaking out of her nose. 'Nothing,' she snarled.\nLogen took a cautious step back. 'Nothing? What's this then?'\nShe bit off each word in her ugly accent and spat them at him. 'I…\ndon't… know.' She wiped her bloody mouth with one hand, then froze.\nLogen glanced over his shoulder. Three more masked men, running at them\ndown the narrow lane.\n'Shit.'\n'Move, pink!' Ferro turned and started running and Logen followed her.\nWhat else could he do? He ran. The horrible, breathless running of the\nhunted, shoulders prickling for a blow in the back, sucking in air in gasps,\nthe slapping footfalls of the men behind echoing around him.\nHigh white buildings flashed past on either side, windows, doors,\nstatues, gardens. People too, shouting as they dived out of the way or\nflattening themselves against the walls. He had no idea where they were, no\nidea where they were going. A man stepped out of a doorway right in front\nof him, a big sheaf of papers in his arms. They crashed together, tumbled to\nthe ground, rolling over and over in the gutter with papers flapping down all\naround them.\nHe tried to get up but his legs were burning. He couldn't see! There was\na piece of paper across his face. He tore it away, felt someone grab him\nunder the arm and haul him along. 'Up, pink!\n'Move!' Ferro. She wasn't even out of breath. Logen's lungs were\nbursting as he struggled to keep up with her but she pulled steadily away,\nhead down, feet flying.\nShe charged through an archway just ahead and Logen laboured after\nher, boots skidding as he turned the corner. A great shadowy space, timbers\nreaching up high above, like a strange forest of square beams. Where the\nhell were they? There was bright light just ahead, open air. He plunged out\ninto it, blinking. Ferro was just beyond him, turning round slowly, breathing\nhard. They were in the middle of a circle of grass, a little circle.\nHe knew where they were now. The arena where he'd sat among the\ncrowds, watching the sword-game. The empty benches stretched away all\nround. There were carpenters crawling amongst them, sawing and\nhammering. They'd already taken some of the benches to pieces near the\nback and the supports stuck up high into the air alone like giant rib bones."

She padded\ntowards the circle silently on the balls of her feet, waved her arm behind\nher, pointing the other two out to the sides, trying to get on the flanks,\nsurround him. Logen cast about, looking for a weapon, but there was\nnothing—just the empty benches and the high white walls beyond. Ferro\nwas backing towards him, not ten feet away, and beyond her there were two\nmore masks, creeping out around the enclosures with sticks in their hands.\nFive. Five altogether.\n'Shit,' he said.\n'What the hell is keeping them?' growled Bayaz, pacing the floor. Jezal had\nnever seen the old man annoyed before, and for some reason it made him\nnervous. Whenever he came close, Jezal wanted to back away. 'I'm having a\nbath, damn it. Could be months before my next one. Months!' Bayaz stalked\nout of the room and slammed the bathroom door behind him, leaving Jezal\nalone with the apprentice.\nThey were probably close enough in age, but they had nothing else in\ncommon, so far as Jezal could see, and he stared with unconcealed\ncontempt. A sickly, weaselly, puny, bookish sort. Sulking like that, moping\naround, it was pathetic. Rude, too. Damn rude. Jezal fumed silently. Just\nwho did he think he was, the arrogant pup? What the hell did he have to be\nso upset about? It wasn't him who'd had his life stolen out from under him.\nStill, if he had to be left alone with one of them, he supposed it could\nhave been worse.

He could hear Ferro screaming somewhere behind\nhim, fury or pain he couldn't say, he was too busy taking a battering.\nSomething smacked across his skull, hard enough to send him reeling\naway towards the seats. He fell on his face and the front bench hit him in\nthe chest, driving the air from his lungs. There was blood running down his\nscalp, on his hands, in his mouth. His eyes were watering from a blow to\nthe nose, his knuckles were all skinned and bloody, near as ripped as his\nclothes were. He lay there, for a moment, gathering whatever strength was\nleft. There was a thick length of timber lying on the ground behind the\nbench. He grabbed hold of the end of it. It was loose. He dragged it towards\nhim. It felt good in his hand. Heavy.\nHe sucked in air, summoning one more effort. He moved his arms and\nlegs a little, testing them. Nothing broken—except his nose maybe, but it\nwas hardly the first time. He heard footsteps coming up behind. Slow\nfootsteps, taking their time.\nHe pushed himself up, slowly, trying to look as though he was in a daze.\nThen he let go a roar and spun round, swinging the timber over his head. It\nbroke in half across the masked man's shoulder with a mighty crack, half of\nit flying up off the turf and clattering away. The man gave a muffled wail\nand sank down, eyes screwed shut, one hand clutching at his neck, the other\nhanging useless, stick dropping from his fingers. Logen hefted the short\npiece of wood left in his hands and clubbed him across the face with it. It\nsnapped his head back and drove him into the turf, mask half torn off, blood\nbubbling out from underneath.\nLogen's head exploded with light and he tottered and sagged down on to\nhis knees. Someone had hit him in the back of the head. Hit him hard. He\nswayed there for a moment trying to stop himself falling on his face, then\nthings came suddenly back into focus. The red-haired woman was standing\nover him, raising her stick high.\nLogen shoved himself up, flailed into her, fumbled with her arm, half\npulling at her, half leaning on her, ears ringing, the world swinging madly.\nThey staggered around, tugging on the stick like two drunkards wrestling\nover a bottle, back and forth in the circle of grass. He felt her punching him\nin the side with her other hand. Hard punches, right in the ribs.\n'Aargh,' he growled, but his head was clearing now, and she was half his\nweight. He twisted the arm with the stick around behind her back. She"

She\npunched him again, a knock on the side of his face that brought the stars\nback for an instant, but then he got hold of her other wrist and pinned that\narm as well. He bent her backwards over his knee.\nShe kicked and twisted, eyes screwed up to furious slits, but Logen had\nher fast. He freed his right hand from the tangle of limbs, brought his fist up\nhigh and mashed it into her stomach. She gave a breathy wheeze and went\nlimp, eyes bulging. He flung her away and she crawled a foot or two, pulled\nher mask down and started coughing puke onto the grass.\nLogen stumbled and swayed, shook his head, spitting blood and dirt out\nonto the grass. Aside from the retching woman, there were four black,\ncrumpled shapes stretched out in the circle. One of them was grunting softly\nas Ferro kicked him over and over. She had blood all over her face, but she\nwas smiling.\n'I am still alive,' Logen muttered to himself, 'I am still…' There were\nmore of them coming through the archway. He swung around, almost\nfalling over. More, four more, from the other side. They were trapped.\n'Move, pink!' Ferro dashed past him and sprang up onto the first bench,\nthen the second, then the third, springing between them with great strides.\nMadness. Where was she going to go from there? Red Hair had stopped\npuking, she was crawling towards her fallen stick. The others were closing\nin fast, more of them than ever. Ferro was already a quarter of the way back\nand showing no signs of slowing, bounding from one bench to the next,\nmaking the planks rattle.\n'Shit.' Logen set off after her. After a dozen benches his legs were\nburning again. He gave up trying to spring between them and started\nscrambling however he could. As he flopped over the backs of the benches\nhe could see the masked men behind—following, watching, pointing and\ncalling, spreading out through the seats.\nHe was slowing now. Each bench was a mountain. The nearest mask\nwas only a few rows behind. He scrambled on, higher and higher, bloody\nhands clutching at the wood, bloody knees scraping across the benches,\nskull echoing with his own breath, skin prickling with sweat and fear. Air\nloomed suddenly empty before him. He stopped, gasping, arms waving,\nteetering on the edge of a dizzying drop.\nHe was close to the high roofs of the buildings behind, but most of the\nseating near the back had already been taken down, leaving the supports\nexposed—single looming pillars, narrow beams between them, and a lot of\nhigh, empty space. He watched Ferro spring from one soaring upright to\nanother, then run across a wobbling plank, heedless of the plunging space\nbelow. She jumped off onto a flat roof at the far end, high above him. It\nseemed a very long way away.\n'Shit.' Logen teetered out across the nearest beam, arms stretched out\nwide for balance, feet moving in an old man's shuffle. His heart was"

His heart was\nbanging like a smith's hammer on an anvil, his knees were weak and\nwobbling from the climb. He tried to ignore the scrambling and shouting of\nthe men behind him and look only at the knotted surface of the beam, but he\ncouldn't look down without seeing the spider's web of timbers below him,\nand the tiny flagstones of the square below them. Far below.\nHe lurched onto a stretch of walkway still intact, clattered up it to the\nfar end. He hauled himself up onto a timber above his head, locked his legs\naround it and dragged himself along on his arse whispering 'I am still alive,'\nto himself, over and over. The nearest mask had made it to the walkway,\nwas running along it towards him.\nThe beam ended at the top of one of the upright struts. A square of wood\na foot or two across. Then there was nothing. Two strides of empty air. Then\nanother square at the top of another dizzying mast, then the plank to the flat\nroof. Ferro stared at him from the parapet.\n'Jump!' she screamed. 'Jump, you pink bastard!'\nHe jumped. He felt the wind around him. His left foot landed on the\nsquare of wood, but there was no stopping. His right foot hit the plank. His\nankle twisted, his knee buckled. The dizzy world pitched. His left foot came\ndown, half on the wood, half off. The plank rattled. He was in the empty air,\nlimbs flailing. It seemed like a long time.\n'Ooof!' The parapet crashed into his chest. His arms clawed with it but\nthere was no breath left in him. He began to slide back, ever so slowly, inch\nby terrible inch. First he could see the roof, then he could see his hands,\nthen he could see nothing but the stones in front of his face. 'Help,' he\nwhispered, but no help came.\nIt was a long way down, he knew that. A long, long way, and there was\nno water to fall into this time. Only hard, flat, fatal stone. He heard a\nrattling. The mask coming across the plank behind him. He heard someone\nshouting, but none of it mattered much now. He slipped backwards a little\nfurther, hands scrabbling at the crumbling mortar. 'Help,' he croaked, but\nthere was no one to help him. Only the masks and Ferro, and none of them\nseemed like the helping kind.\nHe heard a clunk and a despairing shriek. Ferro kicking the plank, and\nthe mask falling. The scream fell away, it felt like for a long time, then it\nwas cut off in a distant thud. The mask's body smashing to pulp against the\nground, far below, and Logen knew he was about to join him. You have to\nbe realistic about these things. There would be no washing up on a river\nbank this time. His fingertips were slipping, slowly, the mortar was starting\nto come apart. The fighting, the running, the climb, they had all sucked the\nstrength out of him, and now there was nothing left. He wondered what"

He wondered what\nsound he would make as he plunged through the air. 'Help,' he mouthed.\nAnd strong fingers closed around his wrist. Dark, dirty fingers. He\nheard growling, felt his arm being pulled, hard. He groaned. The edge of the\nparapet came back into view. He saw Ferro now, teeth gritted, eyes\nsqueezed almost shut with effort, veins standing out from her neck, scar\nlivid against her dark face. He clutched at the parapet with his other hand,\nhis chest came up beyond it, he managed to force his knee over.\nShe hauled him the rest of the way, and he rolled and flopped on his\nback on the other side, gasping like a landed fish, staring up at the white\nsky. 'I am still alive,' he muttered to himself after a moment, hardly able to\nbelieve it. It wouldn't have been too much of a surprise if Ferro had trodden\non his hands and helped him fall.\nHer face appeared above him, yellow eyes staring down, teeth bared in\na snarl. 'You stupid, heavy pink bastard!'\nShe turned away, shaking her head, stalked to a wall and started\nclimbing, hauling herself up fast towards a low-pitched roof above. Logen\nwinced as he watched her. Did she never get tired? His arms were battered,\nbruised, scratched all over. His legs ached, his nose had started bleeding\nagain. Everything hurt. He turned and looked down. One mask was staring\nat him from the edge of the benches, twenty strides away. A few more were\nscurrying around below, looking for some way up. Far below, in the yellow\ncircle of grass, he could see a thin black figure with red hair, pointing\naround, then up at him, giving orders.\nSooner or later they would find a way up. Ferro was perched on the\npeak of the roof above him, a ragged dark shape against the bright sky. 'Stay\nthere if you want,' she barked, then turned and disappeared. Logen groaned\nas he stood up, groaned as he shuffled to the wall, sighed as he began to\nsearch for a handhold.\n'Where is everyone?' demanded Brother Longfoot. 'Where is my illustrious\nemployer? Where is Master Ninefingers? Where is the charming lady,\nMaljinn?'\nJezal looked around. The sickly apprentice was sunk too deep in self-\ncentred gloom to answer. 'I don't know about the other two, but Bayaz is in\nthe bath.'\n'I swear, I never came upon a man more attached to bathing than he. I\nhope the others will not be long. All is prepared, you know! The ship is\nready. The stores are loaded. It is not my way to delay. Indeed it is not! We\nmust catch the tide, or be stuck here until—' The little man paused, staring\nup at Jezal with a sudden concern. 'You seem upset, my young friend.\nTroubled, indeed.

Can I, Brother Longfoot, be of any assistance?'\nJezal had half a mind to tell him to mind his own business, but he\nsettled for an irritated, 'No, no.'\n'I'd wager that there is a woman involved. Would I be right?' Jezal\nlooked up sharply, wondering how the man could have guessed. 'Your wife,\nperhaps?'\n'No! I'm not married! It's nothing like that. It's er, well,' he fumbled for\nthe words to describe it, and failed. 'It's nothing like that is all!'\n'Ah,' said the Navigator, with a knowing grin. 'Ah, a forbidden love\nthen, a secret love is it?' Much to his annoyance, Jezal found that he was\nblushing. 'I am right, I see it! There is no fruit so sweet as the one you\ncannot taste, eh, my young friend? Eh? Eh?' He waggled his eyebrows in\nwhat Jezal felt was a most unsavoury fashion.\n'I wonder what's keeping those two?' Jezal didn't care in the least, but\nanything to change the subject.\n'Maljinn, and Ninefingers? Hah,' laughed Longfoot, leaning towards\nhim. 'Perhaps they've become involved, eh, in a secret love like yours?\nPerhaps they've crept off somewhere, to do what comes naturally!' He\nnudged Jezal in the ribs. 'Can you imagine, those two? That'd be something\nwouldn't it? Hah!'\nJezal grimaced. The hideous Northman he already knew for an animal,\nand from what little he'd seen of that evil woman she might well be worse.\nAll he could imagine coming naturally to them was violence. The idea was\nperfectly revolting. He felt soiled just thinking about it.\nThe roofs seemed to go on forever. Up one, down another. Creeping along\nthe peaks, one slippery foot on either side, edging across ledges, stepping\nover crumbling bits of wall. Sometimes Logen would look up for a\nmoment, get a dizzying view across the tumbling mass of damp slates,\npitted tiles, ancient lead, to the distant wall of the Agriont, sometimes even\nthe city far beyond. It might almost have been peaceful if it wasn't for\nFerro, fast-moving, sure-footed, cursing at him and pulling him on, giving\nhim no time to think about the view, or the nerve-wracking drops they\nskirted, or the black figures, surely still seeking for them below.\nOne of her sleeves had been torn half off some time in the fighting,\nflapping around her wrist, getting in the way as they climbed. She snarled\nand ripped it away at the shoulder. Logen smiled to himself as he recalled\nthe efforts Bayaz had gone to in getting her to change her old stinking rags\nfor new clothes. Now she was filthier than ever, shirt sweated through,\nspotted with blood and caked with grime from the roof-tops. She looked\nover her shoulder and saw him watching her. 'Move, pink,' she hissed at\nhim.\n'You see no colours, right?' She clambered on, ignoring him, swinging\naround a smoking chimney and slithering across the dirty slates on her"

She clambered on, ignoring him, swinging\naround a smoking chimney and slithering across the dirty slates on her\nbelly, sliding down onto a narrow ledge between two roofs. Logen\nscrambled down behind her. 'No colours at all.'\n'So?' she threw over her shoulder.\n'So why do you call me pink?'\nShe looked round. 'Are you pink?'\nLogen peered at his forearms. Aside from the mottled bruises, red\nscratches, blue veins, they were sort of pink, it had to be said. He frowned.\n'Thought so.' She scurried away between the roofs, right to the end of\nthe building, and peered down. Logen followed her, leaned out gingerly\nover the edge. A couple of people were moving around in the lane below.\nFar below, and there was no way down. They'd have to go back the way\nthey came. Ferro had already moved away behind him.\nWind flicked at the side of Logen's face. Ferro's foot slapped against the\nedge of the roof, and then she was in the air. His jaw hung open as he\nwatched her fly away, back arched, arms and legs flailing. She landed on a\nflat roof, grey lead streaked with green moss, rolled once then came up\nsmoothly to her feet.\nLogen licked his lips, pointed at his chest. She nodded. The flat roof\nwas ten feet below, but there might have been twenty feet of empty air\nbetween him and it, and it was a long way down. He backed away slowly,\ngiving himself a good run-up. He sucked in a couple of deep breaths, closed\nhis eyes for a moment.\nIt would be perfect, in a way, if he fell. No songs, no stories. Just a\nbloody smear on a road somewhere. He started running. His feet thumped\non the stone. The air whistled in his mouth, plucked at his torn clothes. The\nflat roof came flying up towards him. He landed with a shuddering impact,\nrolled once just as Ferro had done, stood up beside her. He was still alive.\n'Hah!' he shouted. 'What d'you think of that?'\nThere was a creaking sound, then a cracking, then the roof gave way\nunder Logen's feet. He grabbed despairingly at Ferro as he fell and she slid\nthrough after him, helpless. He tumbled in the air for a sickening moment,\nwailing, hands clutching at nothing. He crashed down on his back.\nLogen coughed on choking dust, shook his head, shifted painfully. He\nwas in a room, inky dark after the brightness outside. Dust was filtering\ndown through the light from the ragged hole in the roof above. There was\nsomething soft under him. A bed. It had half collapsed, leaning at an angle,\nblankets covered in broken plaster. There was something across his legs.\nFerro. He snorted a gurgling laugh to himself. In bed with a woman again,\nat last. Unfortunately it wasn't quite what he'd been hoping for.\n'Stupid fucking pink!' she snarled, scrabbling off him and over to the\ndoor, bits of wood and plaster sliding off her dusty back.

It's—' Logen crashed past her, ripping the door off its\nhinges and sprawling out into the corridor beyond.\nFerro sprang over him. 'Up, pink, up!' A handy-looking length of wood\nhad split from the edge of the door, a couple of nails sticking out of the end.\nLogen snatched it up in his hand. He struggled to his feet, stumbled down\nthe corridor a few paces, came to a junction. A shadowy hallway stretched\naway to either side. Small windows cast sharp pools of light on the dark\nmatting.\nNo way to tell which way Ferro had gone. He turned right, towards a\nflight of stairs.\nThere was a figure moving carefully down the dim corridor towards\nhim. Long and thin like a black spider in the darkness, balanced on the balls\nof its feet. A chink of light shone on bright red hair.\n'You again,' said Logen, weighing the length of wood in his hand.\n'That's right. Me.' There was a jingling sound, a flash of metal in the\ndark. Logen felt the piece of wood ripped out of his fingers and he saw it fly\nover the woman's shoulder and clatter away down the corridor. Unarmed\nagain, but she didn't give him long to worry about it. There was something\nin her hand, something like a knife, and she threw it at him. He ducked out\nof the way and it hissed past his ear, then she jerked her other arm and\nsomething slashed him across the face, just under his eye. He lurched back\nagainst the wall, trying to understand what kind of magic he was facing.\nIt was like a metal cross, the thing in her hand, three curved blades, one\nwith a hook on the end. A chain looped from a ring on the handle and\ndisappeared up her sleeve.\nThe knife-thing darted out, missed Logen's face by an inch as he bobbed\naway, struck a shower of sparks as it ripped back along the wall and slapped\nsmoothly back into her hand. She let it drop, swinging gently from its chain,\nrattling against the floor, jumping and dancing towards him as she edged\nforward. She jerked her wrist and the thing shot out at Logen again, slashed\nacross his chest as he tried to get away, spattering drops of blood against the\nwall.\nHe dived at her but his outspread arms caught nothing. There was a\nrattle and he felt his foot dragged from under him, his ankle snapped round\npainfully, caught by the chain as she ducked by. He sprawled out on his\nface, started to push himself up. The chain snaked under his neck. He just\ngot his hand behind it before it snapped taut. The woman was on top of him,\nhe could feel her knee pressing into his back, could hear her breath hissing\nthrough her mask as she pulled, the chain growing tighter and tighter,\ncutting into the palm of his hand.\nLogen grunted, scrabbling to his knees, lumbering unsteadily to his feet.\nThe woman was still on his back, all her weight bearing down on him,"

Logen flailed around with his free\nhand but he couldn't get at her, couldn't throw her off- she was like a\nbarnacle stuck fast to him. He could hardly breathe now. He tottered\nforward a few steps, then dropped over backwards.\n'Uurgh,' whispered the woman in his ear as his weight crushed her into\nthe floor. The chain went slack enough for Logen to drag it clear and slither\nout from under it. Free. He rolled over and grabbed the woman's neck with\nhis left hand, started squeezing. She kneed at him, dug at him with her fists,\nbut his weight was across her and the blows were weak. They snarled and\ngasped and croaked at each other, animal sounds, faces only inches apart. A\ncouple of spots of blood dripped from the cut on his cheek and pattered on\nher mask. Her hand came up and started fumbling with his face, pushing his\nhead back. Her finger forced its way up his nose.\n'Aargh!' he screamed. Pain stabbed up into his head. He let go of her\nand staggered up, one hand clasped to his face. She scrambled away,\ncoughing, landed a kick in his ribs that bent him over, but he still had a grip\non the chain and he yanked on it with all his weight. Her arm snapped out\nand she yelped and flew straight into him, his knee sinking into her side,\ncrushing the breath out of her. Logen grabbed hold of the back of her shirt,\nhalf lifted her off the floor and flung her down the stairs.\nShe rolled and flopped and bounced her way down, slid to a stop on her\nside near the bottom. Logen was half-tempted to follow her down and finish\nthe job, but he had no time. There'd be more where she came from. He\nturned and hobbled back the other way, cursing his twisted ankle.\nSounds crept up on him from all around, echoing down the corridor\nfrom who knew where. Distant rattling and banging, shouts and cries. He\nstared into darkness, limping, running with sweat, one hand on the wall to\nsteady himself. He leaned round a corner, trying to see if it was clear. He\nfelt something cold across his neck. A knife.\n'Still alive?' whispered a voice in his ear. 'You don't die easy, eh, pink?'\nFerro. He slowly pushed her arm away.\n'Where d'you get the knife?' He wished he had one.\n'He gave it me.' There was a crumpled shape in the shadows by the wall,\nthe matting all round soaked with dark blood. 'This way.'\nFerro crept off down the corridor, keeping low in the darkness. He could\nstill hear the sounds, beneath them, beside them, all around them. They\ncrept down a flight of stairs, out into a dim hallway panelled with dark\nwood.

He turned to run,\nbut Ferro held her arm out. There were more, coming the other way. There\nwas a big door on his left, standing open a crack.\n'In here!' Logen shoved his way through and Ferro darted in after him.\nThere was a heavy piece of furniture beside it, a big cupboard thing with\nshelves on top, covered in plates. Logen grabbed hold of one end and\ndragged it across in front of the doors, a couple of the plates dropping off\nand smashing on the floor. He pressed his back against it. That should hold\nthem for a moment, at least.\nA big room with a high vaulted ceiling. Two huge windows took up\nmost of one wood-panelled wall, a big stone fireplace facing them. A long\ntable stood between, ten chairs on either side, set for eating with cutlery and\ncandlesticks. A big dining room, and there was only one way in. Or out.\nLogen heard muffled shouting beyond the door. The big cupboard\nwobbled against his back. Another plate clattered from its shelf, bounced\noff his shoulder and smashed on the stone flags, scattering fragments across\nthe floor.\n'Nice fucking plan,' snarled Ferro. Logen's feet slid as he strained to\nhold the teetering cupboard up. She dashed over to the nearest window,\nfumbled at the metal frames round the little panes, prising with her\nfingernails, but there was no way out.\nLogen's eye caught on something. An old greatsword, mounted over the\nfireplace as an ornament. A weapon. He gave the cupboard one last shove\nthen hurried over to it, seized hold of the long hilt in both hands and ripped\nit from its bracket. It was blunt as a plough, the heavy blade spotted with\nrust, but still solid. A blow from it might not cut a man in half, but it would\nknock him down alright. He turned just in time to see the cupboard tipping\nover, dropping shattering crockery all over the stone floor.\nBlack figures spilled into the room, masked figures. The one at the front\nhad an evil-looking axe, the next a short-bladed sword. The one behind him\nwas dark-skinned, with gold rings through his ears. He had a long, curved\ndagger in either hand.\nThose weapons were not for knocking a man oh the head with, not\nunless they meant to knock his brains right out. Seemed that they'd given up\non taking prisoners. Killing weapons, meant to kill. Well, so much the\nbetter, Logen told himself. If you say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, and\none thing only, say he's a killer. He eyed those black-masked men,\nclambering over the fallen cupboard, spreading out cautiously around the\nfar wall. He glanced over at Ferro, lips curled back, knife in her hand,\nyellow eyes sparkling. He fingered the grip of his stolen sword—heavy and\nbrutal.

Just the tool for the job, for once.\nHe plunged at the nearest mask, yelling at the top of his voice, swinging\nthe sword over his head. The man tried to duck away but the tip of the blade\ncaught him on the shoulder and knocked him reeling. Another one jumped\nin behind him, chopping with his axe, sending Logen stumbling away,\ngasping as his weight went onto his bad ankle.\nHe flailed around with the big sword, but there were too many. One\nscrambled over the table, got between him and Ferro. Something hit him in\nthe back and he stumbled, spun, slipped, lashed out with the sword and hit\nsomething soft. Somebody screamed, but by then the one with the axe was\ncoming for him again. Everything was a mess of masks and iron, clashing,\nscraping weapons, curses and cries, ragged breathing.\nLogen swung the sword but he was so tired, so hurt, so aching. The\nsword was heavy, and getting heavier all the time. The mask weaved out of\nthe way and the rusty blade clanged into the wall, knocking a great chunk\nout of the wooden panelling and biting into the plaster behind, the shock\nnearly jarring it out of his hands.\n'Ooof,' he breathed as the man kneed him in the stomach. Something hit\nhim in the leg and he nearly fell. He could hear somebody yelling behind,\nbut it seemed far away. His chest was hurting, his mouth was sour. There\nwas blood on him. All over him. He could hardly breathe. The mask stepped\nforward, and again, smiling, smelling victory. Logen lurched back towards\nthe fireplace, his foot slipping, falling down on one knee.\nAll things come to an end.\nHe couldn't lift the old sword any more. There was no strength left.\nNothing. The room was growing blurry.\nAll things come to an end, but some only lie still, forgotten…\nThere was a cold feeling in Logen's stomach, a feeling he hadn't felt for\na long time.

The Bloody-Nine kneels to no man.\nHis fingers sought out the cracks between the stones of the fireplace, prising\nbetween them like old tree roots, pulling him up. His leg hurt and he smiled.\nPain was the fuel that made the fires burn. Something moved in front of\nhim. Masked men. Enemies.\nCorpses, then.\n'You're hurt, Northman!' The eyes of the closest one sparkled above his\nmask, the shining blade of his axe danced in the air. 'Want to give up yet?'\n'Hurt?' The Bloody-Nine threw back his head and laughed. 'I'll fucking\nshow you hurt!' He tumbled forward, flowed beneath the axe, slippery as\nfishes in the river, swinging the heavy blade in a great low circle.

He gave a muffled\nscream as he spun onto the stones, turning round and round in the air,\nshattered legs flopping.\nSomething dug into the Bloody-Nine's back, but there was no pain. It\nwas a sign. A message in a secret tongue, that only he could understand. It\ntold him where the next dead man was standing. He reeled around and the\nsword followed him in a furious, beautiful, irresistible arc. It crunched into\nsomeone's guts, folded him in half, snatched him off his feet and flung him\nthrough the air. He bounced from the wall beside the fireplace and crumpled\non the floor in a shower of broken plaster.\nA knife whirled, hissing, stuck deep into the Bloody-Nine's shoulder\nwith a damp thud. The black one, with the rings through his ears. He had\nthrown it. He was on the other side of the table, smiling, pleased with his\nthrow. A terrible mistake. The Bloody-Nine came for him. Another knife\nflashed past, clattered against the wall. He sprang over the table and the\nsword followed behind.\nThe dark man dodged the first great swing, and the second. Fast and\ntricky clever, but not clever enough. The third blow bit him in the side. A\nglancing bite. Just a nibble. It only smashed his ribs and knocked him\nscreaming to his knees. The last one was better, a circle of flesh and iron\nthat carved into his mouth and ripped his head half off, showering blood\nacross the walls. The Bloody-Nine plucked the knife from his shoulder and\ntossed it to the floor. Blood ran from the wound, soaked through his shirt\nand made a great, lovely, warm red stain.\nHe dropped and faded away, leaves falling from the tree, rolling across\nthe ground. A man lunged past, slashing at the air where he had stood with a\nshort-bladed sword. Before he could turn, the Bloody-Nine was on him, left\nhand snaking round his fists. He struggled and strained, but it was useless.\nThe Bloody-Nine's grip was strong as the roots of mountains, relentless as\nthe tide. 'They send such as you to fight me?' He flung the man back against\nthe wall and squeezed, crushing his hands around the grip of his weapon,\nturning the short blade until it was pointing at his chest. 'A fucking insult!'\nhe roared, spitting him on his own sword.\nThe man screamed, and screamed behind his mask, and the Bloody-\nNine laughed, and twisted the blade. Logen might have pitied him, but\nLogen was far away and the Bloody-Nine had no more pity in him than the\nwinter. Less even. He stabbed, and cut, and cut, and smiled, and the screams\nbubbled and died, and he let the corpse drop to the cold stones. His fingers\nwere slick with blood and he wiped it on his clothes, on his arms, on his\nface—just as it should be.\nThe one by the fireplace was sitting, hanging limp, head back, eyes like\nwet stones, staring at the ceiling.

The Bloody-Nine\nsmashed his face open with the sword just to make sure. Best to leave no\ndoubts. The one who'd had the axe was crawling for the door, legs twisted\nout and dragging over the stones behind him, gasping and whimpering all\nthe way.\n'Quiet now.' The heavy blade crunched into the back of the man's skull\nand sprayed his blood across the stones.\n'More,' he whispered, and the room turned around him as he sought out\nthe next kill. 'More!' he bellowed, and he laughed, and the walls laughed,\nand the corpses laughed with him. 'Where's the rest of you?'\nHe saw a dark-skinned woman, with a bleeding cut on her face and a\nknife in her hand. She didn't look like the others, but she would do just as\nwell. He smiled, crept forward, raising the sword in both hands. She\nstepped away, watching him, keeping the table between them, hard yellow\neyes like the wolf. A tiny voice seemed to tell him that she was on his side.\nShame.\n'Northerner, eh?' asked a massive shape in the doorway.\n'Aye, who's asking?'\n'The Stone-Splitter.'\nHe was big this one, very big, and tough, and savage. You could see it\non him as he shoved the cupboard away with his huge boot and crunched\nforward through the broken plates. It meant less than nothing to the Bloody-\nNine though—he was made to break such men. Tul Duru Thunderhead had\nbeen bigger. Rudd Threetrees had been tougher. Black Dow had been twice\nas savage. The Bloody-Nine had broken them, and plenty more besides. The\nbigger, the tougher, the more savage he was, so much the worse would be\nhis breaking.\n'Stone-Shitter?' laughed the Bloody-Nine. 'So fuckin' what? Next to die\nis what y'are, and nothing more!' He held his left hand up, spattered with\nred blood, three fingers spread out wide, grinning through the gap where the\nmiddle one used to be, a long time ago. 'They call me the Bloody-Nine.'\n'Dah!' The Stone-Splitter ripped off his mask and threw it on the floor.\n'Liar! There's plenty o' men in the north have lost a finger. They ain't all\nNinefingers!'\n'No. Only me.'\nThat great face twisted up with rage. 'You fucking liar! You think to\nscare the Stone-Splitter with a name that's not your own? I'll carve a new\narse in you, maggot! I'll put the bloody cross on you! I'll put you back in the\nmud you coward fucking liar!'\n'Kill me?' The Bloody-Nine laughed louder than ever. 'I do the killing,\nfool!'\nThe talk was done. Stone-Splitter came at him with axe in one hand and\nmace in the other, great heavy weapons, though he used them quick enough.\nThe mace swung across, smashed a great hole through the glass in one of\nthe windows.

The Bloody-Nine\ntwitched away, frog hopping, waiting for his time.\nThe mace missed his shoulder by an inch as he rolled across the table,\ncracked one of the big flat stones on the floor, split it down the middle,\nchips flying through the air. Stone-Splitter roared, swinging his weapons,\nsmashing a chair in half, knocking a chunk of stone out of the fireplace,\nchopping a great gash in the wall. His axe stuck fast in the wood for a\nmoment and the Bloody-Nine's sword flashed over, broke the haft into\nsplintered halves, leaving the Stone-Splitter with a broken stick in his paw.\nHe flung it away and hefted the mace, came on even harder, swinging it\nround with furious bellows.\nIt sailed over and the Bloody-Nine's sword caught it just below the\nhead, ripped it out of the big hand. It twisted through the air and clattered\ninto the corner, but the Stone-Splitter pressed forward, spreading his great\nhands out wide. Too close to use the big sword now. Stone-Splitter smiled\nas his huge arms closed around the Bloody-Nine, folding him tight, holding\nhim fast. 'Got yer!' he shouted, squeezing him in a great hug.\nAn awful mistake. Better to embrace the burning fire.\nCrack!\nThe Bloody-Nine's forehead smashed into his mouth. He felt the Stone-\nSplitter's grip slacken a little and he wriggled his shoulders, making room,\nwriggling, wriggling, mole in his burrow. He swung his head back as far as\nit would go. Billy-goat charges. The second head-butt smashed the Stone-\nSplitter's flat nose open. He grunted and the big arms released a little more.\nThe third cracked his cheekbone. The arms fell away. The fourth broke his\nheavy jaw. Now it was the Bloody-Nine holding him up, smiling as he\nmashed his forehead into the shattered face. Woodpecker pecking, tap, tap,\ntap. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. There was a satisfying rhythm to the crunching\nof the face bones. Nine, and he let the Stone-Splitter fall. He sagged\nsideways and crumpled onto the floor, blood spilling from his ruined face.\n'How's that for yer?' laughed the Bloody-Nine, wiping blood out of his\neyes and giving the Stone-Splitter's lifeless body a couple of kicks. The\nroom spun around him, swam around him, laughing, laughing. 'How's\nthat… fuck…' He stumbled, blinked, sleepy, campfire guttering. 'No… not\nyet…' He dropped to his knees. Not yet. There was more to do, always\nmore. 'Not yet,' he snarled, but his time was up…\n… Logen screamed. He fell down. Pain, everywhere. His legs, his shoulder,\nhis head.

He gurgled up blood and drooled it out, long enough to start\nwailing again.\nA hand clamped over his mouth. 'Stop your damn crying, pink! Now,\nyou hear me?' A voice, whispering urgent in his ear. Strange, hard voice.\n'Stop your crying or I leave you, understand? One chance!' The hand came\naway. Air came out between his gritted teeth in a high pitched, keening\nmoan, but not too loud.\nA hand clamped round his wrist, dragged his arm up. He gasped as his\nshoulder stretched out, was dragged over something hard. Torture. 'Up,\nbastard, I can't carry you! Up, now! One chance, understand?'\nHe was lifted slowly, he tried to push with his legs. The breath whistled\nand clicked in his throat, but he could do it. Left foot, right foot. Easy. His\nknee buckled, pain stabbed up his leg. He screamed again and fell,\ngrovelled on the floor. Best to lie still. His eyes closed.\nSomething slapped him hard in the face, and again. He grunted.\nSomething slid under his armpit, started to pull him up.\n'Up, pink! Up, or I leave you. One chance, you hear?'\nBreath in, breath out. Left foot, right foot.\nLongfoot fussed and worried, first tapping his fingers on the arm of his\nchair, then counting on them, shaking his head and moaning about tides.\nJezal stayed silent, hoping against hope that the two savages might have\ndrowned in the moat, and that the whole venture might therefore come to\nnothing. There would still be plenty of time to make it to Angland. Perhaps\nall was not lost…\nHe heard the door open behind him, and his dreams were punctured.\nMisery swaddled him once again, but it was soon replaced by horrified\nsurprise as he turned around.\nTwo ragged shapes stood in the doorway, covered in blood and filth.\nDevils, surely, stepped out from some gate to hell. The Gurkish woman was\ncursing as she lurched into the room. Ninefingers had one arm across her\nshoulders, the other swinging loose, blood dripping from his fingertips,\nhead drooping.\nThey wobbled together for a step or two, then the Northman's stumbling\nfoot caught on a chair leg and they tumbled onto the floor. The woman\nsnarled and shrugged off his limp arm, shoved him away and scrambled up\nto her feet. Ninefingers rolled over slowly, groaning, and a deep gash in his\nshoulder yawned open, oozing blood across the carpet. It was red in there,\nlike fresh meat in a butcher's shop. Jezal swallowed, horrified and\nfascinated at once.\n'God's breath!'\n'They came for us.'\n'What?'\n'Who came?'\nA woman sidled cautiously around the door frame, red-haired, all in\nblack, wearing a mask. A Practical, Jezal's numb brain was saying, but he\ncould not understand why she was so bruised, or walking with such a limp."

Maljinn spat at her. Jezal was shocked to see she had\nproduced a knife from somewhere, and a bloody one at that. She should not\nbe armed! Not here!\nHe realised, stupidly, that he was wearing a sword. Of course he was.\nHe fumbled with the hilt and drew it, with the vague intention of knocking\nthe Gurkish devil on the back of the head with the flat before she could do\nany more damage. If the Inquisition wanted her they could damn well have\nher, and the rest of them too. Unfortunately, the Practicals got the wrong\nidea.\n'Drop it,' hissed the red-haired woman, glaring at him through narrow\neyes.\n'I will not!' said Jezal, tremendously offended that she might think he\nwas on the side of these villains.\n'Erm…' said Quai.\n'Aaargh,' groaned Ninefingers, clutching up a bloody handful of carpet\nand dragging it towards him, making the table lurch across the floor.\nA third Practical crept through the door, around the red-haired woman, a\nheavy mace in his gloved fist. An unpleasant-looking weapon. Jezal could\nnot help picturing the effect it might have on his skull, if swung in anger.\nHe fingered the hilt of his sword uncertainly, feeling in terrible need of\nsomeone to tell him what to do.\n'Coming with us,' said the woman again, as her two friends advanced\nslowly into the room.\n'Oh dear,' murmured Longfoot, taking cover behind the table.\nThen the door to the bathroom banged against the wall. Bayaz stood\nthere, entirely naked, dripping with soapy water. His slow gaze took in first\nFerro, scowling with her knife out, then Longfoot hiding behind the table,\nJezal with sword drawn, Quai standing with his mouth open, Ninefingers\nsprawled out in a bloody ruin, and finally the three black masked figures,\nweapons at the ready.\nThere was a pregnant pause.\n'What the fuck is this?' he roared, striding into the centre of the room,\nwater dripping from his beard, down through the grizzled white hairs on his\nchest, off his slapping fruits. It was a strange sight to see. A naked old man\nconfronting three armed Practicals of the Inquisition. Ridiculous, and yet no\none was laughing. There was something strangely terrifying about him,\neven without his clothes and running with wet. It was the Practicals who\nshifted backwards, confused, scared even.\n'You're coming with us,' the woman repeated, though a certain doubt\nseemed to have entered her voice. One of her companions stepped warily\ntoward Bayaz.\nJezal felt a strange sensation in his stomach. A tugging, a sucking, an\nempty, sick feeling. It was like being back on the bridge, in the shadow of\nthe Maker's House. Only worse. The wizard's face had turned terribly hard.\n'My patience is at an end.'"

The wizard's face had turned terribly hard.\n'My patience is at an end.'\nLike a bottle dropped from a great height, the nearest Practical burst\napart. There was no thunderclap, only a gentle squelching. One moment he\nwas moving toward the old man, sword raised, entirely whole. The next he\nwas a thousand fragments. Some unknown part of him thudded wetly\nagainst the plaster next to Jezal's head. His sword dropped and rattled on the\nboards.\n'You were saying?' growled the First of the Magi.\nJezal's knees trembled. His mouth gaped. He felt faint, and queasy, and\nawfully hollow inside. There were spots of blood across his face, but he\ndared not move to wipe them off. He stared at the naked old man, unable to\nbelieve his eyes. It seemed that he had watched a well-meaning old buffoon\nchange in an instant into a brutal murderer, and without the slightest grain\nof hesitation.\nThe red-haired woman stood there a moment, spattered with blood and\nflecks of meat and bone, eyes wide as two dinner plates, then started to\nshuffle slowly backwards towards the door. The other one followed her,\nalmost tripping over Ninefingers' foot in his haste to get away. Everyone\nelse stayed motionless as statues. Jezal heard quick footsteps in the corridor\noutside as the two Practicals ran for their lives. He almost envied them.\nThey, it seemed, would escape. He was trapped in this nightmare.\n'We must leave, now!' barked Bayaz, wincing as if he was in pain, 'just\nas soon as I have my trousers on. Help him, Longfoot!' he shouted over his\nshoulder. For once, the Navigator was lost for words. He blinked, then got\nup from behind the table and bent down over the unconscious Northman,\nripped off a strip of his tattered shirt to use as a bandage. He paused,\nfrowning, as though unsure where to begin.\nJezal swallowed. His sword was still in his hand, but he seemed to lack\nthe strength to put it away. Bits of the unfortunate Practical were scattered\naround the room, stuck to the walls, the ceiling, the people. Jezal had never\nseen a man die before, let alone in so hideous and unnatural a fashion. He\nsupposed he should have been horrified, but instead he felt only an\noverpowering sense of relief. His worries seemed now rather petty things.\nHe, at least, was still alive.\nThe Tools we Have\n« ^\nGlokta stood in the narrow hallway, leaning on his cane and waiting. On the\nother side of the door, he could hear raised voices.\n'I said, no visitors!'\nHe sighed to himself. He had many better things to do than to stand\naround here on his aching leg, but he had given his word and he meant to\nkeep it. A pokey, unremarkable hallway in a pokey, unremarkable house\namong many hundreds of others the same.

Houses for the gentlefolk. The new rich.\nJumped-up commoners, Sult would probably have called them. Bankers,\nmerchants, artisans, shop keepers, clerks. Perhaps the odd town-house of\nsome successful gentleman farmer, like this one here.\nThe voices had stopped now. Glokta heard movement, some clinking of\nglass, then the door opened a crack and the maid peered out. An ill-favoured\ngirl with big, watery eyes. She looked scared and guilty. Still, I am used to\nthat. Everyone seems scared and guilty around the Inquisition.\n'She'll see you now,' the girl mumbled. Glokta nodded and shuffled past\nher into the room beyond.\nHe had some hazy memories of staying with West's family for a week or\ntwo one summer, up in Angland, a dozen years ago perhaps, although it\nseemed more like a hundred. He remembered fencing with West in the\ncourtyard of their house, of being watched every day by a dark-haired girl\nwith a serious face. He remembered meeting a young woman in the park\nnot long ago, who had asked him how he was. He had been in a lot of pain\nat the time, scarcely seeing straight, and her face was a blur in his memory.\nSo it was that Glokta was not sure what to expect, but he certainly had not\nexpected the bruises. He was a touch shocked, for a moment. Though I hide\nit well.\nDark, purple and brown and yellow, under her left eye, the lower lid\nwell swollen. Round the corner of her mouth too, the lip split and scabbed\nover. Glokta knew a lot about bruises, few men more. And I hardly think\nshe got these by accident. She was punched in the face, by someone who\nmeant it. He looked at those ugly marks, and he thought about his old friend\nCollem West, crying in his dining room and begging for help, and he put the\ntwo together.\nInteresting.\nShe sat there, all the while, looking back at him with her chin high, the\nside of her face with the worst bruises turned towards him, as though\nchallenging him to say something. She is not much like to her brother. Not\nmuch like at all. I don't think she'll be bursting into tears in my dining room,\nor anywhere else.\n'What can I do for you, Inquisitor?' she asked him coldly. He detected\nthe very slightest slurring of the word Inquisitor. She has been drinking…\nthough she hides it well. Not enough to make her stupid. Glokta pursed his\nlips. For some reason he had the feeling that he needed to watch his step.\n'I'm not here in a professional capacity. Your brother asked me to—'\nShe cut him off rudely. 'Did he? Really? Here to make sure I don't fuck\nthe wrong man, are you?' Glokta waited for a moment, allowing that to sink\nin, then he began to chuckle softly to himself. Oh, that's grand! I begin to\nquite like her! 'Something funny?' she snapped."

I daresay, if I had known I'd be\nthere half that long at the start, I would have made a more concerted effort\nto kill myself. Seven hundred days, give or take, in the darkness. As close to\nhell, I would have thought, as a living man can go. My point is this—if you\nmean to upset me you'll need more than harsh language.'\nGlokta treated her to his most revolting, toothless, crazy smile. There\nwere few people indeed who could stomach that for long, but she did not\nlook away for an instant. Soon, in fact, she was smiling back at him. A lop-\nsided grin of her own, and one which he found oddly disarming. A different\ntack, perhaps.\n'The fact is, your brother asked me to look after your welfare while he is\naway. As far as I'm concerned you can fuck whomever you please, though\nmy general observation has been that, as far as the reputations of young\nwomen are concerned, the less fucking the better. The reverse is true for\nyoung men of course. Hardly fair, but then life is unfair in so many ways,\nthis one hardly seems worth commenting on.'\n'Huh. You're right there.'\n'Good,' said Glokta, 'so we understand each other then. I see that you\nhurt your face.'\nShe shrugged. 'I fell. I'm a clumsy fool.'\n'I know how you feel. I'm such a fool I knocked half my teeth out and\nhacked my leg to useless pulp. Look at me now, a cripple. It's amazing\nwhere a little foolishness can take you, if it goes unchecked. We clumsy\ntypes should stick together, don't you think?'\nShe looked at him thoughtfully for a moment, stroking the bruises on\nher jaw. 'Yes,' she said, 'I suppose we should.'\nGoyle's Practical, Vitari, was sprawled on a chair opposite Glokta, just\noutside the huge dark doors to the Arch Lector's office. She was slumped\ninto it, poured onto it, draped over it like a wet cloth, long limbs dangling,\nhead resting on the back. Her eyes twitched lazily around the room from\ntime to time under heavy lids, sometimes coming to rest on Glokta himself\nfor insultingly long periods. She never turned her head though, or indeed\nmoved a muscle, as though the effort might be too painful.\nWhich, indeed, it probably would be.\nPlainly, she had been involved in a most violent melee, hand to hand.\nAbove her black collar, her neck was a mass of mottled bruises. There were\nmore around her black mask, a lot more, and a long cut across her forehead.\nOne of her drooping hands was heavily bandaged, the knuckles of the other\nwere scratched and scabbed over. She's taken more than a couple of knocks.\nFighting hard, against someone who meant business.\nThe tiny bell jumped and tinkled. 'Inquisitor Glokta,' said the secretary,"

The\nArch Lector's fury could not fall upon a more deserving candidate. Glokta\ncould not suppress the tiniest of smiles as he watched him go.\n'Something amusing you?' Sult's voice was ice as he held out his white\ngloved hand, purple stone flashing on his finger.\nGlokta bent to kiss it. 'Of course not, your Eminence.'\n'Good, because you've nothing to be amused about, I can tell you!\nKeys?' he sneered. 'Stories? Scrolls? What could have possessed me to\nlisten to your drivel?'\n'I know, Arch Lector, I apologise.' Glokta edged humbly into the chair\nthat Goyle had so recently vacated.\n'You apologise, do you? Everyone apologises! Some good that does me!\nFewer apologies and more successes is what I need! And to think, I had\nsuch high hopes for you! Still, I suppose we must work with the tools we\nhave.'\nMeaning? But Glokta said nothing.\n'We have problems. Very serious problems, in the South.'\n'The South, Arch Lector?'\n'Dagoska. The situation there is grave. Gurkish troops are flocking to\nthe peninsula. They already outnumber our garrison by ten to one, and all\nour strength is committed in the North. Three regiments of the King's Own\nremain in Adua, but with the peasants getting out of hand across half of\nMidderland, they cannot be spared. Superior Davoust was keeping me\ninformed in weekly letters. He was my eyes, Glokta, do you understand? He\nsuspected that there was a conspiracy afoot within the city. A conspiracy\nintending to deliver Dagoska into the hands of the Gurkish. Three weeks\nago the letters stopped, and yesterday I learned that Davoust has\ndisappeared. Disappeared! A Superior of the Inquisition! Vanished into thin\nair! I am blind, Glokta. I am fumbling in the dark at a most crucial time! I\nneed someone there that I can trust, do you understand?'\nGlokta's heart was thumping. 'Me?'\n'Oh you're learning,' sneered Sult. 'You are the new Superior of\nDagoska.'\n'Me?'\n'Many congratulations, but forgive me if we leave the feast until a"

        "text": "'Oh you're learning,' sneered Sult. 'You are the new Superior of\nDagoska.'\n'Me?'\n'Many congratulations, but forgive me if we leave the feast until a\nquieter moment! You, Glokta, you!' The Arch Lector leaned down over him.\n'Go to Dagoska and dig. Find out what happened to Davoust. Weed the\ngarden down there. Root out everything disloyal. Everything and anyone.\nLight a fire under them! I need to know what's going on, if you have to toast\nthe Lord Governor until he drips gravy!'\nGlokta swallowed. 'Toast the Lord Governor?'\n'Is there an echo in here?' snarled Sult, looming even lower. 'Sniff out\nthe rot, and cut it away! Hack it off! Burn it out! All of it, wherever it is!\nTake charge of the city's defences yourself if you must. You were a soldier!'\nHe reached out and slid a single sheet of parchment across the table top.\n'This is the King's writ, signed by all twelve chairs on the Closed Council.\nAll twelve. I sweated blood to get it. Within the city of Dagoska, you will\nhave full powers.'\nGlokta stared down at the document. A simple sheet of cream-coloured\npaper, black writing, a huge red seal at the bottom. We, the undersigned,\nconfer upon His Majesty's faithful servant, Superior Sand dan Glokta, our\nfull powers and authority… Several blocks of neat writing, and below, two\ncolumns of names. Crabby blotches, flowing swirls, near illegible scrawls.\nHoff, Sult, Marovia, Varuz, Halleck, Burr, Torlichorm, and all the rest.\nPowerful names. Glokta felt faint as he picked up the document in his two\ntrembling hands. It seemed heavy.\n'Don't let it go to your head! You still have to tread carefully. We can\nstand no more embarrassments, but the Gurkish must be kept out at all\ncosts, at least until this business in Angland is settled. At all costs, do you\nunderstand?'\nI understand. A posting to a city surrounded by enemies and riddled\nwith traitors, where one Superior has already mysteriously disappeared.\nCloser to a knife in the back than a promotion, but we must work with the\ntools we have. 'I understand, Arch Lector.'\n'Good. Keep me well informed. I want to be swamped by your letters.'\n'Of course.'\n'You have two Practicals, correct?'\n'Yes, your Eminence, Frost and Severard, both very—'\n'Not nearly enough! You won't be able to trust anyone down there, not\neven the Inquisition.' Sult seemed to think about that for a moment.\n'Especially the Inquisition. I have picked out a half dozen others whose\nskills are proven, including Practical Vitari.'\nThat woman, watching over my shoulder? 'But, Arch Lector—'\n'Don't \"but\" me, Glokta!' hissed Sult. 'Don't you dare \"but\" me, not\ntoday! You're not half as crippled as you could be! Not half as crippled, you\nunderstand?'\nGlokta bowed his head. 'I apologise.'"

        "text": "today! You're not half as crippled as you could be! Not half as crippled, you\nunderstand?'\nGlokta bowed his head. 'I apologise.'\n'You're thinking, aren't you? I can see the cogs turning. Thinking you\ndon't want one of Goyle's people getting in the way? Well, before she\nworked for him she worked for me. A Styrian, from Sipano. Cold as the\nsnow, those people, and she's the coldest of them, I can tell you. So you\nneedn't worry. Not about Goyle, anyway' No. Only about you, which is far\nworse.\n'I will be honoured to have her along.' I will be damned careful.\n'Be as honoured as you damn well please, just don't let me down! Make\na mess of this and you'll need more than that piece of paper to save you. A\nship is waiting at the docks. Leave. Now'\n'Of course, your Eminence.'\nSult turned away and strode over to the window. Glokta quietly got up,\nquietly slid his chair under the table, quietly shuffled across the room. The\nArch Lector was still standing, hands clasped behind him, as Glokta ever so\ncarefully pulled the doors to. It was not until they clicked shut that he\nrealised he had been holding his breath.\n'How'd it go?'\nGlokta turned round sharply, his neck giving a painful click.\nStrange, how I never learn not to do that. Practical Vitari was still\nflopped in her chair, looking up at him with tired eyes. She did not seem to\nhave moved the whole time he was inside. How did it go? He ran his tongue\naround his mouth, over his empty gums, thinking about it. That remains to\nbe seen. 'Interesting,' he said in the end. 'I am going to Dagoska.'\n'So I hear.' The woman did indeed have an accent, now he thought about\nit. A slight whiff of the Free Cities.\n'I understand you're coming with me.'\n'I understand I am.' But she did not move.\n'We are in something of a hurry.'\n'I know.' She held out her hand. 'Could you help me up?'\nGlokta raised his eyebrows. I wonder when I was last asked that\nquestion? He had half a mind to say no, but in the end he held his hand out,\nif only for the novelty. Her fingers closed round it, started to pull. Her eyes\nwere narrowed, he could hear her breath hissing as she unfolded herself\nslowly from the chair. It hurt, having her pull on him like that, in his arm, in\nhis back. But it hurts her more. Behind her mask, he was pretty sure, her\nteeth were gritted with pain. She moved her limbs one at a time, cautiously,\nnot sure what would hurt and how much. Glokta had to smile. A routine I go\nthrough myself every morning. Strangely invigorating, to see someone else\ndoing it.\nEventually she was standing, her bandaged hand clutched against her\nribs. 'You able to walk?' asked Glokta.\n'I'll loosen up.'\n'What happened? Dogs?'\nShe gave a bark of laughter. 'No. A big Northman knocked the shit out\nof me.'"

        "text": "'I'll loosen up.'\n'What happened? Dogs?'\nShe gave a bark of laughter. 'No. A big Northman knocked the shit out\nof me.'\nGlokta snorted. Well, forthright at least. 'Shall we go?'\nShe looked down at his cane. 'Don't suppose you've got one of those\nspare, have you?'\n'I'm afraid not. I only have the one, and I can't walk without it.'\n'I know how you feel.'\nNot quite. Glokta turned and began to limp away from the Arch Lector's\noffice. Not quite. He could hear the woman hobbling along behind.\nStrangely invigorating to have someone trying to keep up with me. He\nupped the pace, and it hurt him. But it hurts her more.\nBack to the South, then. He licked at his empty gums. Hardly a place of\nhappy memories. To fight the Gurkish, after what it cost me last time. To\nroot out disloyalty in a city where no one can be trusted, especially those\nsent to help me. To struggle in the heat and the dust, at a thankless task\nalmost certain to end in failure. And failure, more than likely, will mean\ndeath.\nHe felt his cheek twitch, his eyelid flicker. At the hands of the Gurkish?\nAt the hands of plotters against the crown? At the hands of his Eminence, or\nhis agents? Or simply to vanish, as my predecessor did? Has one man ever\nhad such a range of deaths to choose from? The corner of his mouth\ntwitched up. I can hardly wait to get started.\nThat same question came into his head, over and over, and he still had\nno answer.\nWhy do I do this?\nWhy?\nAcknowledgments\nFour people without whom…\nBren Abercrombie, whose eyes are sore from reading it\nNick Abercrombie, whose ears are sore from hearing about it\nRob Abercrombie, whose fingers are sore from turning the pages\nLou Abercrombie, whose arms are sore from holding me up\nAnd also…\nMatthew Amos, for solid advice at a shaky time\nGillian Redfearn, who read past the beginning and made me change it\nSimon Spanton, who bought it before he got to the end\nv1.0 html"
