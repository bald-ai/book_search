It gets in your eyes, so you can’t see no more than a few\nstrides ahead. It gets in your ears, so you can’t hear nothing, and when you\ndo you can’t tell where it’s coming from. It gets up your nose, so you can’t\nsmell naught but wet and damp. Damn mist. It’s a curse on a scout.\nThey’d crossed the Whiteflow a few days before, out of the North and\ninto Angland, and the Dogman had been nervy all the way. Scouting out\nstrange land, in the midst of a war that weren’t really their business. All the\nlads were jumpy. Aside from Threetrees, none of ’em had ever been out of\nthe North. Except for Grim maybe. He weren’t saying where he’d been.\nThey’d passed a few farms burned out, a village all empty of people.\nUnion buildings, big and square. They’d seen the tracks of horses and men.\nLots of tracks, but never the men themselves. Dogman knew Bethod\nweren’t far away, though, his army spread out across the land, looking for\ntowns to burn, food to steal, people to kill. All manner o’ mischief. He’d\nhave scouts everywhere. If he caught Dogman or any of the rest, they’d be\nback to the mud, and not quickly. Bloody cross and heads on spikes and all\nthe rest of it, Dogman didn’t wonder.\nIf the Union caught ’em they’d be dead too, most likely. It was a war,\nafter all, and folk don’t think too clearly in a war. Dogman could hardly\nexpect ’em to waste time telling a friendly Northman from an unfriendly\none. Life was fraught with dangers, alright. It was enough to make anyone\nnervy, and he was a nervy sort at the best of times.\nSo it was easy to see how the mist might have been salt in the cut, so to\nspeak.\nAll this creeping around in the murk had got him thirsty, so he picked\nhis way through the greasy brush, over to where he could hear the river\nchattering. He knelt down at the water’s edge. Slimy down there, with rot\nand dead leaves, but Dogman didn’t reckon a little slime would make the\ndifference, he was about as dirty as a man could be already. He scooped up\nwater in his hands and drank. There was a breath of wind down there, out\nbeyond the trees, pushing the mist in close one minute, dragging it out the"

That’s when the Dogman saw him.\nHe was lying on his front, legs in the river, top half up on the bank. They\nstared at each other a while, both fully shocked and amazed. He’d got a\nlong stick coming out of his back. A broken spear. That’s when the Dogman\nrealised he was dead.\nHe spat the water out and crept over, checking careful all around to\nmake sure no one was waiting to give him a blade in the back. The corpse\nwas a man of about two dozen years. Yellow hair, brown blood on his grey\nlips. He’d got a padded jacket on, bloated up with wet, the kind a man\nmight wear under a coat of mail. A fighting man, then. A straggler maybe,\nlost his crew and been picked off. A Union man, no doubt, but he didn’t\nlook so different to Dogman or to anyone else, now he was dead. One\ncorpse looks much like another.\n“The Great Leveller,” Dogman whispered to himself, since he was in a\nthoughtful frame of mind. That’s what the hillmen call him. Death, that is.\nHe levels all differences. Named Men and nobodies, south or north. He\ncatches everyone in the end, and he treats each man the same.\nSeemed like this one had been dead no more ’n a couple of days. That\nmeant whoever killed him might still be close, and that got the Dogman\nworried. The mist seemed full of sounds now. Might’ve been a hundred\nCarls, waiting just out of sight. Might’ve been no more than the river\nslapping at its banks. Dogman left the corpse lying and slunk off into the\ntrees, ducking from one trunk to another as they loomed up out of the grey.\nHe nearly stumbled on another body, half buried in a heap of leaves,\nlying on his back with his arms spread out. He passed one on his knees, a\ncouple of arrows in his side, face in the dirt, arse in the air. There’s no\ndignity in death, and that’s a fact. The Dogman was starting to hurry along,\ntoo keen to get back to the others, tell them what he’d seen. Too keen to get\naway from them corpses.\nHe’d seen plenty, of course, more than his share, but he’d never quite\ngot comfortable around ’em. It’s an easy thing to make a man a carcass. He\nknew a thousand ways to do it. But once you’ve done it, there’s no going\nback. One minute he’s a man, all full up with hopes, and thoughts, and\ndreams. A man with friends, and family, and a place where he’s from. Next\nminute he’s mud. Made the Dogman think on all the scrapes he’d been in,\nall the battles and the fights he’d been a part of. Made him think he was\nlucky still to be breathing. Stupid lucky. Made him think his luck might not\nlast.\nHe was halfway running now. Careless. Blundering about in the mist\nlike an untried boy.

        "text": "last.\nHe was halfway running now. Careless. Blundering about in the mist\nlike an untried boy. Not taking his time, not sniffing the air, not listening\nout. A Named Man like him, a scout who’d been all over the North,\nshould’ve known better, but you can’t stay sharp all the time. He never saw\nit coming.\nSomething knocked him in the side, hard, ditched him right on his face.\nHe scrambled up but someone kicked him down. Dogman fought, but\nwhoever this bastard was, he was fearsome strong. Before he knew it he\nwas down on his back in the dirt, and he’d only himself to blame. Himself,\nand the corpses, and the mist. A hand grabbed him round his neck, started\nsqueezing his windpipe shut.\n“Gurgh,” he croaked, fiddling at the hand, thinking his last moment was\non him. Thinking all his hopes were turned to mud. The Great Leveller,\ncome for him at last…\nThen the fingers stopped squeezing.\n“Dogman?” said someone in his ear. “That you?”\n“Gurgh.”\nThe hand let go his throat and he sucked in a breath. Felt himself pulled\nup by his coat. “Shit on it, Dogman! I could ha’ killed you!” He knew the\nvoice now, well enough. Black Dow, the bastard. Dogman was half annoyed\nat being throttled near to dying, half stupid-happy at still being alive. He\ncould hear Dow laughing at him. Hard laughter, like a crow calling. “You\nalright?”\n“I’ve had warmer greetings,” croaked Dogman, still doing his best to get\nthe air in.\n“Count yourself lucky, I could’ve given you a colder one. Much colder. I\ntook you for one of Bethod’s scouts. Thought you was out over yonder, up\nthe valley.”\n“As you can see,” he whispered, “no. Where’s the others at?”\n“Up on a hill, above this fucking mist. Taking a look around.”\nDogman nodded back the way he’d come. “There’s corpses over there.\nLoads of ’em.”\n“Loads of ’em is it?” asked Dow, as though he didn’t think Dogman\nknew what a load of corpses looked like. “Hah!”\n“Aye, a good few anyway. Union dead, I reckon. Looks like there was a\nfight here.”\nBlack Dow laughed again. “A fight? You reckon?” Dogman wasn’t sure\nwhat he meant by that.\nS\nhit,” he said.\nThey were standing up on the hill, the five of them. The mist had cleared\nup, but the Dogman almost wished it hadn’t. He saw what Dow had been\nsaying now, well enough. The whole valley was full of dead. They were\ndotted high up on the slopes, wedged between the rocks, stretched out in the\ngorse. They were scattered out across the grass in the valley bottom like\nnails spilled from a sack, twisted and broken on the brown dirt road. They\nwere heaped up beside the river, heaped on the banks in a pile. Arms and\nlegs and broken gear sticking up from the last shreds of mist. They were\neverywhere. Stuck with arrows, stabbed with swords, hacked with axes."

Stuck with arrows, stabbed with swords, hacked with axes.\nCrows called as they hopped from one meal to the next. It was a good day\nfor the crows. It had been a while since Dogman saw a proper battlefield,\nand it brought back some sour memories. Horrible sour.\n“Shit,” he said again. Couldn’t think of aught else to say.\n“Reckon the Union were marching up this road.” Threetrees was\nfrowning hard. “Reckon they were hurrying. Trying to catch Bethod\nunawares.”\n“Seems they weren’t scouting too careful,” rumbled Tul Duru. “Seems\nlike it was Bethod caught them out.”\n“Maybe it was misty,” said Dogman, “like today.”\nThreetrees shrugged. “Maybe. It’s the time of year for it. Either way\nthey were on the road, in column, tired from a long day’s tramp. Bethod\ncame on ’em from here, and from up there, on the ridge. Arrows first, to\nbreak ’em up, then the Carls, coming down from the tall ground, screaming\nand ready to go. The Union broke quick, I reckon.”\n“Real quick,” said Dow.\n“And then it was a slaughter. Spread out on the road. Trapped against the\nwater. Nowhere much to run to. Men trying to pull their armour off, men\ntrying to swim the river with their armour on. Packing in and climbing one\non top o’ the other, with arrows falling down all round. Some of ’em\nmight’ve got as far as those woods down there, but knowing Bethod, he’d\nhave had a few horsemen tucked away, ready to lick the plate.”\n“Shit,” said Dogman, feeling more than a bit sick. He’d been on the\nwrong end of a rout himself, and the memory weren’t at all a happy one.\n“Neat as good stitching,” said Threetrees. “You got to give Bethod his\ndue, the bastard. He knows his work, none better.”\n“This the end of it then, chief?” asked Dogman. “Bethod won already?”\nThreetrees shook his head, nice and slow. “There’s a lot of Southerners\nout there. An awful lot. Most of ’em live across the sea. They say there’s\nmore of ’em down there than you can count. More men than there are trees\nin the North. Might take ’em a while to get here, but they’ll be coming. This\nis just the beginning.”\nThe Dogman looked out at the wet valley, at all them dead men, huddled\nand sprawled and twisted across the ground, no more ’n food for crows.\n“Not much of a beginning for them.”\nDow curled his tongue and spat, as noisy as he could. “Penned up and\nslaughtered like a bunch o’ sheep! You want to die like that, Threetrees?\nEh? You want to side with the likes of these? Fucking Union!

There were children, ragged and dirty. There were men, old\nand young, stooped under heavy packs or clutching gear. Some had mules,\nor carts they were pushing, loaded up with all kinds of useless-looking stuff.\nWooden chairs, tin pots, tools for farming. A lot had nothing at all, besides\nmisery. The Dogman reckoned there was plenty of that to go round.\nThey were choking up the road with their bodies and their rubbish. They\nwere choking up the air with their pleading and their threatening. Dogman\ncould smell the fear, thick as soup in his nose. All running from Bethod.\nThey were shouldering each other pretty good, some pushing in, some\npushed out, here and there one falling in the mud, all desperate for that gate\nlike it was their mother’s tit. But as a crowd, they were going nowhere.\nDogman could see spear tips glinting over the heads of the press, could hear\nhard voices shouting. There were soldiers up ahead, keeping everyone out\nof the city.\nDogman leaned over to Threetrees. “Looks like they don’t want their\nown kind,” he whispered. “You reckon they’ll want us, chief?”\n“They need us, and that’s a fact. We’ll talk to ’em, and then we’ll see, or\nyou got some better notion?”\n“Going home and staying out of it?” muttered Dogman under his breath,\nbut he followed Threetrees into the crowd anyway.\nThe Southerners all gawped as they stepped on through. There was a\nlittle girl among ’em, looked at Dogman as he passed with great staring\neyes, clutching some old rag to her. Dogman tried a smile but it had been a\nlong time since he’d dealt with aught but hard men and hard metal, and it\ncan’t have come out too pleasing. The girl screamed and ran off, and she\nwasn’t the only one scared. The crowd split open, wary and silent when\nthey saw Dogman and Threetrees coming, even though they’d left their\nweapons back with the others.\nThey made it through to the gate alright, only having to give the odd\nshove to one man or another, just to start him moving. Dogman saw the\nsoldiers now, a dozen of ’em, stood in a line across the gate, each one just\nthe same as the one next door. He’d rarely seen such heavy armour as they\nhad on, great plates from head to toe, polished to a blinding shine, helmets\nover their faces, stock-still like metal pillars. He wondered how you’d fight\none, if you had to. He couldn’t imagine an arrow doing much, or a sword\neven, ’less it got lucky and found a joint.\n“You’d need a pickaxe for that, or something.”\n“What?” hissed Threetrees.\n“Nothing.” It was plain they had some strange ideas about fighting down\nin the Union. If wars were won by the shinier side, they’d have had Bethod\nwell licked, the Dogman reckoned. Shame they weren’t.\nTheir chief was sat in the midst of them, behind a little table with some"

        "text": "well licked, the Dogman reckoned. Shame they weren’t.\nTheir chief was sat in the midst of them, behind a little table with some\nscraps of paper on it, and he was the strangest of the lot. He’d got some\njacket on, bright red. An odd sort of cloth for a leader to wear, Dogman\nthought. You’d have picked him out with an arrow easy enough. He was\nmighty young for the job an’ all. Scarcely had a beard on him yet, though he\nlooked proud enough of himself all the same.\nThere was a big man in a dirty coat arguing with him. Dogman strained\nto listen, trying to make sense of their Union words. “I’ve five children out\nhere,” the farmer was saying, “and nothing to feed them with. What do you\nsuggest I do?”\nAn old man got in first. “I’m a personal friend of the Lord Governor, I\ndemand you admit me to the—”\nThe lad didn’t let either one finish. “I don’t give a damn who your\nfriends are, and I don’t care if you have a hundred children! The city of\nOstenhorm is full. Lord Marshal Burr has decreed that only two hundred\nrefugees be admitted each day, and we have already reached our limit for\nthis morning. I suggest you come back tomorrow. Early.”\nThe two men stood there staring. “Your limit?” growled the farmer.\n“But the Lord Governor—”\n“Damn you!” screamed the lad, thumping at the table in a fit. “Only\npush me further! I’ll let you in alright! I’ll have you dragged in, and hung as\ntraitors!”\nThat was enough for those two, they backed off quick. Dogman was\nstarting to think he should do the same, but Threetrees was already making\nfor the table. The boy scowled up at ’em as though they stank worse than a\npair of fresh turds. Dogman wouldn’t have been so bothered, except he’d\nwashed specially for the occasion. Hadn’t been this clean in months. “What\nthe hell do you want? We’ve no need of spies or beggars!”\n“Good,” said Threetrees, clear and patient. “We’re neither. My name is\nRudd Threetrees. This here is the Dogman. We’re come to speak to\nwhoever’s in charge. We’re come to offer our services to your King.”\n“Offer your services?” The lad started to smile. Not a friendly smile at\nall. “‘Dogman,’ you say? What an interesting name. I can’t imagine how he\ncame by it.” He had himself a little snigger at that piece of cleverness, and\nDogman could hear chuckles from the others. A right set of arseholes, he\nreckoned, stitched up tight in their fancy clothes and their shiny armour. A\nright set of arseholes, but there was nothing to be gained by telling ’em so.\nIt was a good thing they’d left Dow behind. He’d most likely have gutted\nthis fool already, and got them all killed.\nThe lad leaned forward and spoke real slow, as if to children. “No\nNorthmen are allowed within the city, not without special permission.”\nSeemed that Bethod crossing their borders, slaughtering their armies,\nmaking war across their lands weren’t special enough.

Threetrees ploughed\non, but the Dogman reckoned he was ploughing in stony ground, alright.\n“We’re not asking much. Only food and a place to sleep. There’s five of us,\neach one a Named Man, veterans all.”\n“His Majesty is more than well supplied with soldiers. We are a little\nshort of mules, however. Perhaps you’d care to carry some supplies for us?”\nThreetrees was known for his patience, but there was a limit to it, and\nDogman reckoned they were awful close. This prick of a boy had no idea\nwhat he was stepping on. He weren’t a man to be toyed with, Rudd\nThreetrees. It was a famous name where they came from. A name to put\nfear in men, or courage, depending where they stood. There was a limit to\nhis patience alright, but they weren’t quite at it yet. Luckily for all\nconcerned.\n“Mules, eh?” growled Threetrees. “Mules can kick. Best make sure one\ndon’t kick your head off, boy.” And he turned around and stalked off, down\nthe road the way they came, the scared folks shuffling out the way then\ncrowding back in behind, all shouting at once, pleading with the soldiers\nwhy they should be the ones to get let in while the others were left out in\nthe cold.\n“That weren’t quite the welcome we was hoping for,” Dogman\nmuttered. Threetrees said nothing, just marched away in front, head down.\n“What now, chief?”\nThe old boy shot a grim look over his shoulder. “You know me. You\nthink I’m taking that fucking answer?” Somehow, the Dogman reckoned\nnot.\nBest Laid Plans\nI\nt was cold in the hall of the Lord Governor of Angland. The high walls\nwere of plain, cold render, the wide floor was of cold stone flags, the gaping\nfireplace held nothing but cold ashes. The only decoration was a great\ntapestry hanging at one end, the golden sun of the Union stitched into it, the\ncrossed hammers of Angland in its centre.\nLord Governor Meed was slumped in a hard chair before a huge, bare\ntable, staring at nothing, his right hand slack around the stem of a wine cup.\nHis face was pale and hollow, his robes of state were crumpled and stained,\nhis thin white hair was in disarray. Major West, born and raised in Angland,\nhad often heard Meed spoken of as a strong leader, a great presence, a\ntireless champion of the province and its people. He looked a shell of a man\nnow, crushed under the weight of his great chain of office, as empty and\ncold as his yawning fireplace.\nThe temperature might have been icy, but the mood was cooler still.\nLord Marshal Burr stood in the middle of the floor, feet placed wide apart,\nbig hands clasped white-knuckle tight behind his back. Major West stood at\nhis shoulder, stiff as a log, head lowered, wishing that he had not given up\nhis coat. It was colder in here than outside, if anything, and the weather was\nbitter, even for autumn."

It was colder in here than outside, if anything, and the weather was\nbitter, even for autumn.\n“Will you take wine, Lord Marshal?” murmured Meed, not even looking\nup. His voice seemed weak and reedy thin in the great space. West fancied\nhe could almost see the old man’s breath smoking.\n“No, Your Grace. I will not.” Burr was frowning. He had been frowning\nconstantly, as far as West could tell, for the last month or two. The man\nseemed to have no other expressions. He had a frown for hope, a frown for\nsatisfaction, a frown for surprise. This was a frown of the most intense\nanger. West shifted nervously from one numb foot to the other, trying to get\nthe blood flowing, wishing he was anywhere but here.\n“What about you, Major West?” whispered the Lord Governor. “Will\nyou take wine?” West opened his mouth to decline, but Burr got in first.\n“What happened?” he growled, the hard words grating off the cold\nwalls, echoing in the chilly rafters.\n“What happened?” The Lord Governor shook himself, turned his sunken\neyes slowly towards Burr, as though seeing him for the first time. “I lost my\nsons.” He snatched up his cup with a trembling hand and drained it to the\ndregs.\nWest saw Marshal Burr’s hands clench tighter still behind his back. “I\nam sorry for your loss, Your Grace, but I was referring to the broader\nsituation. I am talking of Black Well.”\nMeed seemed to flinch at the mere mention of the place. “There was a\nbattle.”\n“There was a massacre!” barked Burr. “What is your explanation? Did\nyou not receive the King’s orders? To raise every soldier you could, to man\nyour defences, to await reinforcements? Under no circumstances to risk\nbattle with Bethod!”\n“The King’s orders?” The Lord Governor’s lip curled. “The Closed\nCouncil’s orders, do you mean? I received them. I read them. I considered\nthem.”\n“And then?”\n“I tore them up.”\nWest could hear the Lord Marshal breathing hard through his nose. “You\ntore… them up?”\n“For a hundred years, I and my family have governed Angland. When\nwe came here there was nothing.” Meed raised his chin proudly as he\nspoke, puffing out his chest. “We tamed the wilderness. We cleared the\nforests, and laid the roads, and built the farms, and the mines, and the towns\nthat have enriched the whole Union!”\nThe old man’s eyes had brightened considerably. He seemed taller,\nbolder, stronger. “The people of this land look first to me for protection,\nbefore they look across the sea! Was I to allow these Northmen, these\nbarbarians, these animals to raid across my lands with impunity? To undo\nthe great work of my forefathers? To rob, and burn, and rape, and kill as\nthey pleased? To sit behind my walls while they put Angland to the sword?\nNo, Marshal Burr! Not I! I gathered every man, and I armed them, and I\nsent them to meet the savages in battle, and my three sons went at their\nhead. What else should I have done?”"

What else should I have done?”\n“Followed your fucking orders!” screamed Burr at the very top of his\nvoice. West started with shock, the thunderous echoes still ringing in his\nears.\nMeed twitched, then gaped, then his lip began to quiver. Tears welled up\nin the old man’s eyes and his body sagged again. “I lost my sons,” he\nwhispered, staring down at the cold floor. “I lost my sons.”\n“I pity your sons, and all those others whose lives were wasted, but I do\nnot pity you. You alone brought this upon yourself.” Burr winced, then\nswallowed and rubbed at his stomach. He walked slowly to the window and\nlooked out over the cold, grey city. “You have wasted all your strength, and\nnow I must dilute my own to garrison your towns, your fortresses. Such\nsurvivors as there are from Black Well, and such others as are armed and\ncan fight you will transfer to my command. We will need every man.”\n“And me?” murmured Meed. “I daresay those dogs on the Closed\nCouncil are howling for my blood?”\n“Let them howl. I need you here. Refugees are coming southwards,\nfleeing from Bethod, or from the fear of him. Have you looked out of your\nwindow lately? Ostenhorm is full of them. They crowd around the walls in\ntheir thousands, and this is only the beginning. You will see to their well-\nbeing, and their evacuation to Midderland. For thirty years your people\nhave looked to you for protection. They have need of you still.”\nBurr turned back into the room. “You will provide Major West with a list\nof those units still fit for action. As for the refugees, they are in need of\nfood, and clothing, and shelter. Preparations for their evacuation should\nbegin at once.”\n“At once,” whispered Meed. “At once, of course.”\nBurr flashed West a quick glance from under his thick eyebrows, took a\ndeep breath, then strode for the door. West looked back as he left. The Lord\nGovernor of Angland still sat hunched in his chair in his empty, freezing\nhall, head in his hands.\nT\nhis is Angland,” said West, gesturing at the great map. He turned to look\nat the assembly. Few of the officers were showing the slightest interest in\nwhat he had to say. Hardly a surprise, but it still rankled.\nGeneral Kroy was sitting on the right-hand side of the long table, stiff\nupright and motionless in his chair. He was tall, gaunt, hard, grey hair\ncropped close to his angular skull, black uniform simple and spotless. His\nenormous staff were similarly clipped, shaved, polished, as dour as a bevy\nof mourners. Opposite, on the left, lounged General Poulder, round-faced,\nruddy-skinned, possessed of a tremendous set of moustaches.

His retinue\nsat their chairs like saddles, crimson uniforms dripping with braid, top\nbuttons carelessly undone, spatters of mud from the road worn like medals.\nOn Kroy’s side of the room, war was all about cleanliness, self-denial,\nand strict obedience to the rules. On Poulder’s it was a matter of\nflamboyance and carefully organised hair. Each group glared across the\ntable at the other with haughty contempt, as though only they held the\nsecrets of good soldiering, and the other crowd, try as they might, would\nnever be more than a hindrance.\nEither were hindrance enough to West’s mind, but neither one was half\nthe obstacle that the third lot presented, clustered around the far end of the\ntable. Their leader was none other than the heir to the throne, Crown Prince\nLadisla himself. It was not so much a uniform that he was wearing as a kind\nof purple dressing gown with epaulettes. Bedwear with a military motif.\nThe lace on his cuffs alone could have made a good-sized tablecloth, and\nhis staff were little less remarkable in their finery. Some of the richest, most\nhandsome, most elegant, most useless young men in the whole Union were\nsprawled in their chairs around the Prince. If the measure of a man was the\nsize of his hat, these were great men indeed.\nWest turned back to the map, his throat uncomfortably dry. He knew\nwhat he had to say, he needed only to say it, as clearly as possible, and sit\ndown. Never mind that some of the most senior men in the army were\nbehind him. Not to mention the heir to the throne. Men who West knew\ndespised him. Hated him for his high position and his low birth. For the fact\nthat he had earned his place.\n“This is Angland,” said West again, in what he hoped was a voice of\ncalm authority. “The River Cumnur”—and the end of his stick traced the\ntwisting blue line of the river—“splits the province into two parts. The\nsouthern part is much the smaller, but contains the great majority of the\npopulation and almost all the significant towns, including the capital,\nOstenhorm. The roads here are reasonably good, the country relatively\nopen. As far as we know, the Northmen have yet to set foot across the\nriver.”\nWest heard a loud yawning behind him, clearly audible even from the\nfar end of the table. He felt a sudden pang of fury and spun round. Prince\nLadisla himself appeared, at least, to be listening attentively. The culprit\nwas one of his staff, the young Lord Smund, a man of impeccable lineage\nand immense fortune, a little over twenty but with all the talents of a\nprecocious ten-year-old. He was slouched in his chair, staring into space,\nmouth extravagantly gaping.\nIt was the most West could do to stop himself from leaping over and\nthrashing the man with his stick. “Am I boring you?” he hissed.\nSmund actually seemed surprised to be picked on. He stared left and\nright, as though West might have been talking to one of his neighbours.\n“What, me? No, no, Major West, not in the least. Boring? No! The River"

The River\nCumnur splits the province in two, and so forth. Thrilling stuff! Thrilling! I\ndo apologise, really. Late night, last night, you see?”\nWest did not doubt it. A late night spent drinking and showing off with\nthe rest of the Prince’s hangers-on, all so that he could waste everyone’s\ntime this morning. Kroy’s men might be pedantic, and Poulder’s arrogant,\nbut at least they were soldiers. The Prince’s staff had no skills whatever, as\nfar as West could see, beyond annoying him, of course. At that, they were\nall expert. He was almost grinding his teeth with frustration as he turned\nback to the map.\n“The northern part of the province is a different matter,” he growled.\n“An unwelcoming expanse of dense forests, trackless bogs, and broken\nhills, sparsely populated. There are mines, logging camps, villages, as well\nas several penal colonies operated by the Inquisition, but they are widely\nscattered. There are only two roads even faintly suitable for large bodies of\nmen or supplies, especially given that winter will soon be upon us.” His\nstick traced the two dotted lines, running north to south through the woods.\n“The western road goes close to the mountains, linking the mining\ncommunities. The eastern one follows the coast, more or less. They meet at\nthe fortress of Dunbrec on the Whiteflow, the northern border of Angland.\nThat fortress, as we all know, is already in the hands of the enemy.”\nWest turned away from the map and sat down, trying to breathe slow\nand steady, squash down his anger and see off the headache which was\nalready starting to pulse behind his eyes.\n“Thank you, Major West,” said Burr as he got to his feet to address the\nassembly. The room rustled and stirred, only now coming awake. The Lord\nMarshal strode up and down before the map for a moment, collecting his\nthoughts. Then he tapped at it with his own stick, a spot well to the north of\nthe Cumnur.\n“The village of Black Well. An unremarkable settlement, ten miles or so\nfrom the coast road. Little more than a huddle of houses, now entirely\ndeserted. It isn’t even marked on the map. A place unworthy of anyone’s\nattention. Except, of course, that it is the site of a recent massacre of our\ntroops by the Northmen.”\n“Damn fool Anglanders,” someone muttered.\n“They should have waited for us,” said Poulder, with a self-satisfied\nsmirk.\n“Indeed they should have,” snapped Burr. “But they were confident, and\nwhy not? Several thousand men, well equipped, with cavalry. Many of them\nwere professional soldiers. Not in the same class as the King’s Own\nperhaps, but trained and determined nonetheless. More than a match for\nthese savages, one would have thought.”\n“They put up a good fight though,” interrupted Prince Ladisla, “eh,\nMarshal Burr?”\nBurr glared down the table. “A good fight is one you win, Your\nHighness.

        "text": "Marshal Burr?”\nBurr glared down the table. “A good fight is one you win, Your\nHighness. They were slaughtered. Only those with good horses and very\ngood luck escaped. In addition to the regrettable waste of manpower, there\nis the loss of equipment and supplies. Considerable quantities of each, with\nwhich our enemy is now enriched. Most seriously, perhaps, the defeat has\ncaused panic among the population. The roads our army will depend on are\nclogged with refugees, convinced that Bethod will come upon their farms,\ntheir villages, their homes at any moment. An utter disaster, of course.\nPerhaps the worst suffered by the Union in recent memory. But disasters are\nnot without their lessons.”\nThe Lord Marshal planted his big hands firmly on the table and leaned\nforward. “This Bethod is careful, clever, and ruthless. He is well supplied\nwith horse, foot, and archers, and has sufficient organisation to use them\ntogether. He has excellent scouts and his forces are highly mobile, probably\nmore so than ours, especially in difficult country such as that we will face in\nthe northern part of the province. He set a trap for the Anglanders and they\nfell into it. We must not do the same.”\nGeneral Kroy gave a snort of joyless laughter. “So we should fear these\nbarbarians, Lord Marshal? Would that be your advice?”\n“What was it that Stolicus wrote, General Kroy? ‘Never fear your\nenemy, but always respect him.’ I suppose that would be my advice, if I\ngave any.” Burr frowned across the table. “But I don’t give advice. I give\norders.”\nKroy twitched with displeasure at the reprimand, but at least he shut up.\nFor the time being. West knew that he wouldn’t stay quiet for long. He\nnever did.\n“We must be cautious,” continued Burr, now addressing the room at\nlarge, “but we still have the advantage. We have twelve regiments of the\nKing’s Own, at least as many men in levies from the noblemen, and a few\nAnglanders who avoided the carnage at Black Well. Judging from such\nreports as we have, we outnumber our enemy by five to one, or more. We\nhave the advantage in equipment, in tactics, in organisation. The Northmen,\nit seems, are not ignorant of this. Despite their successes, they are\nremaining north of the Cumnur, content to forage and mount the odd raid.\nThey do not seem keen to come across the river and risk an open battle with\nus.”\n“One can hardly blame ’em, the dirty cowards,” chuckled Poulder, to\nmutterings of agreement from his own staff. “Probably regretting they ever\ncrossed the border now!”\n“Perhaps,” murmured Burr. “In any case, they are not coming to us, so\nwe must cross the river and hunt them down. The main body of our army\nwill therefore be split into two parts, the left wing under General Kroy, the\nright under General Poulder.” The two men eyed each other across the table\nwith the deepest hostility. “We will push up the eastern road from our\ncamps here at Ostenhorm, spread out beyond the River Cumnur, hoping to\nlocate Bethod’s army and bring him to a decisive battle.”\n“With the greatest respect,” interrupted General Kroy, in a tone that"

The coast road offers richer\npickings, and is closer to their own lines of supply and retreat. Besides, I do\nnot wish our forces to be too thinly spread. We are still guessing at Bethod’s\nstrength. If we can bring him to battle, I want to be able to concentrate our\nforces quickly, and overwhelm him.”\n“But, Lord Marshal!” Kroy had the air of a man addressing a senile\nparent who still, alas, retains the management of their own affairs. “Surely\nthe western road should not be left unguarded?”\n“I was coming to that,” growled Burr, turning back to the map. “A third\ndetachment, under the command of Crown Prince Ladisla, will dig in\nbehind the Cumnur and stand guard on the western road. It will be their job\nto make sure the Northmen do not slip around us and gain our rear. They\nwill hold there, south of the river, while our main body splits in two and\nflushes out the enemy.”\n“Of course, my Lord Marshal.” Kroy sat back in his chair with a\nthunderous sigh, as though he had expected no better but had to try anyway,\nfor everyone’s sake, while the officers of his staff tutted and clucked their\ndisapproval for the scheme.\n“Well, I find it an excellent plan,” announced Poulder warmly. He\nsmirked across the table at Kroy. “I am entirely in favour, Lord Marshal. I\nam at your disposal in any way you should think fit. I shall have my men\nready to march within ten days.” His staff nodded and hummed their assent.\n“Five would be better,” said Burr.\nPoulder’s plump face twitched his annoyance, but he quickly mastered\nhimself. “Five it is, Lord Marshal.” But now it was Kroy’s turn to look\nsmug.\nCrown Prince Ladisla, meanwhile, was squinting at the map, an\nexpression of puzzlement slowly forming on his well-powdered face. “Lord\nMarshal Burr,” he began slowly, “my detachment is to proceed down the\nwestern road to the river, correct?”\n“Indeed, Your Highness.”\n“But we are not to pass beyond the river?”\n“Indeed not, Your Highness.”\n“Our role is to be, then,” and he squinted up at Burr with a hurt\nexpression, “a purely defensive one?”\n“Indeed. Purely defensive.”\nLadisla frowned. “That sounds a meagre task.” His absurd staff shifted\nin their seats, grumbled their discontent at an assignment so far beneath\ntheir talents.\n“A meagre task? Pardon me, Your Highness, but not so! Angland is a\nwide and tangled country. The Northmen may elude us, and if they do, it is\non you that all our hopes will hang. It will be your task to prevent the\nenemy from crossing the river and threatening our lines of supply, or, worse\nyet, marching on Ostenhorm itself.” Burr leaned forward, fixing the Prince"

        "text": "enemy from crossing the river and threatening our lines of supply, or, worse\nyet, marching on Ostenhorm itself.” Burr leaned forward, fixing the Prince\nwith his eye, and shook his fist with great authority. “You will be our rock,\nYour Highness, our pillar, our foundation! You will be the hinge on which\nthe gate will hang, a gate which will swing shut on these invaders, and drive\nthem out of Angland!”\nWest was impressed. The Prince’s assignment was indeed a meagre one,\nbut the Lord Marshal could have made mucking out the latrines sound like\nnoble work. “Excellent!” exclaimed Ladisla, the feather on his hat thrashing\nback and forth. “The hinge, of course! Capital!”\n“Unless there are any further questions then, gentlemen, we have a great\ndeal of work to do.” Burr looked round the half circle of sulky faces. No\none spoke. “Dismissed.”\nKroy’s staff and Poulder’s exchanged frosty glances as they hurried to\nbe first out of the room. The two great Generals themselves jostled each\nother in the doorway, which was more than wide enough for both of them,\nneither wanting to turn his back on the other, or to follow behind him. They\nturned, bristling, once they had pushed their way out into the corridor.\n“General Kroy,” sneered Poulder, with a haughty toss of his head.\n“General Poulder,” hissed Kroy, tugging his impeccable uniform\nsmooth.\nThen they stalked off in opposite directions.\nAs the last of Prince Ladisla’s staff ambled out, holding forth to each\nother noisily about who had the most expensive armour, West got up to\nleave himself. He had a hundred tasks to be getting on with, and there was\nnothing to be gained by waiting. Before he got to the door, though, Lord\nMarshal Burr began to speak.\n“So there’s our army, eh, West? I swear, I sometimes feel like a father\nwith a set of squabbling sons, and no wife to help me. Poulder, Kroy, and\nLadisla.” He shook his head. “My three commanders! Every man of them\nseems to think the purpose of this whole business is his personal\naggrandisement. There aren’t three bigger heads in the whole Union. It’s a\nwonder we can fit them all in one room.” He gave a sudden burp. “Damn\nthis indigestion!”\nWest racked his brains for something positive. “General Poulder seems\nobedient, at least, sir.”\nBurr snorted. “Seems, yes, but I trust him even less than Kroy, if that’s\npossible. Kroy, at least, is predictable. He can be depended on to frustrate\nand oppose me at every turn. Poulder can’t be depended on at all. He’ll\nsmirk, and flatter, and obey to the tiniest detail, until he sees some\nadvantage to himself, and then he’ll turn on me with double the ferocity,\nyou’ll see. To keep ’em both happy is impossible.” He squinted and\nswallowed, rubbing at his gut. “But as long as we can keep them equally\nunhappy, we’ve a chance. The one thing to be thankful for is that they hate\neach other even more than they do me.”"

The one thing to be thankful for is that they hate\neach other even more than they do me.”\nBurr’s frown grew deeper. “They were both ahead of me in the queue for\nmy job. General Poulder is an old friend of the Arch Lector, you know.\nKroy is High Justice Marovia’s cousin. When the post of Lord Marshal\nbecame available, the Closed Council couldn’t decide between them. In the\nend they fixed on me as an unhappy compromise. An oaf from the\nprovinces, eh, West? That’s what I am to them. An effective oaf to be sure,\nbut an oaf still. I daresay that if Poulder or Kroy died tomorrow, I’d be\nreplaced the next day by the other. It’s hard to imagine a more ludicrous\nsituation for a Lord Marshal, until you add in the Crown Prince, that is.”\nWest almost winced. How to turn that nightmare into an advantage?\n“Prince Ladisla is… enthusiastic?” he ventured.\n“Where would I be without your optimism?” Burr gave a mirthless\nchuckle. “Enthusiastic? He’s living in a dream! Pandered to, and coddled,\nand utterly spoiled his whole life! That boy and the real world are entire\nstrangers to one another!”\n“Must he have a separate command, sir?”\nThe Lord Marshal rubbed at his eyes with his thick fingers.\n“Unfortunately, he must. The Closed Council have been most specific on\nthat point. They are concerned that the King is in poor health, and that his\nheir is seen as an utter fool and wastrel by the public. They hope we might\nwin some great victory here, so they can heap the credit on the Prince. Then\nthey’ll ship him back to Adua, glowing with the glamour of the battlefield,\nready to become the kind of King the peasants love.”\nBurr paused for a moment, and looked down at the floor. “I’ve done all I\ncan to keep Ladisla out of trouble. I’ve put him where I think the Northmen\naren’t, and with any luck won’t ever be. But war is anything but a\npredictable business. Ladisla might actually be called upon to fight. That’s\nwhy I need someone to look over his shoulder. Someone with experience in\nthe field. Someone as tenacious and hard-working as his joke of a staff are\nsoft and lazy. Someone who might stop the Prince from blundering into\ntrouble.” He looked up from under his heavy brows.\nWest felt a horrible sinking sensation in his guts. “Me?”\n“I’m afraid so. There’s no one I’d rather keep, but the Prince has asked\nfor you personally.”\n“For me, sir? But I’m no courtier! I’m not even a nobleman!”\nBurr snorted. “Aside from me, Ladisla is probably the one man in this\narmy who doesn’t care whose son you are. He’s the heir to the throne!\nNobleman or beggar, we’re all equally far below him.”\n“But why me?”\n“Because you’re a fighter. First through the breach at Ulrioch and all\nthat.

You’ve a fighter’s reputation,\nWest, and the Prince wants one himself. That’s why.” Burr fished a letter\nfrom his jacket and handed it across. “Maybe this will help to sweeten the\nmedicine.”\nWest broke the seal, unfolded the thick paper, scanned the few lines of\nneat writing. When he had finished, he read it again, just to be sure. He\nlooked up. “It’s a promotion.”\n“I know what it is. I arranged it. Maybe they’ll take you a little more\nseriously with an extra star on your jacket, maybe they won’t. Either way,\nyou deserve it.”\n“Thank you, sir,” said West numbly.\n“What, for the worst job in the army?” Burr laughed, and gave him a\nfatherly clap on the shoulder. “You’ll be missed, and that’s a fact. I’m riding\nout to inspect the first regiment. A commander should show his face, I’ve\nalways thought. Care to join me, Colonel?”\nS\nnow was falling by the time they rode out through the city gates. White\nspecks blowing on the wind, melting as soon as they touched the road, the\ntrees, the coat of West’s horse, the armour of the guards that followed them.\n“Snow,” Burr grumbled over his shoulder. “Snow already. Isn’t that a\nlittle early in the year?”\n“Very early, sir, but it’s cold enough.” West took one hand from his reins\nto pull his coat tighter round his neck. “Colder than usual, for the end of\nautumn.”\n“It’ll be a damn sight colder up north of the Cumnur, I’ll be bound.”\n“Yes, sir, and it won’t be getting any warmer now.”\n“Could be a harsh winter, eh, Colonel?”\n“Very likely, sir.” Colonel? Colonel West? The words still seemed\nstrange together, even in his own mind. No one could ever have dreamed a\ncommoner’s son would go so far. Himself least of all.\n“A long, harsh winter,” Burr was musing. “We need to catch Bethod\nquickly. Catch him and put a quick end to him, before we all freeze.” He\nfrowned at the trees as they slipped by, frowned up at the flecks of snow\neddying around them, frowned over at West. “Bad roads, bad ground, bad\nweather. Not the best situation, eh, Colonel?”\n“No, sir,” said West glumly, but it was his own situation that was\nworrying him.\n“Come now, it could be worse. You’ll be dug in south of the river, nice\nand warm. Probably won’t see a hair of a Northman all winter. And I hear\nthe Prince and his staff eat pretty well. A damn stretch better than\nblundering around in the snow with Poulder and Kroy for company.”\n“Of course, sir.” But West was less than sure.\nBurr glanced over his shoulder at the guards, trotting along at a\nrespectful distance. “You know, when I was a young man, before I was\ngiven the dubious honour of commanding the King’s army, I used to love to"

Sometimes, you just want to ride, eh, West?”\n“Of course, sir, but now would—”\n“Yah!” The Lord Marshal dug his spurs in with a will and his horse\nbolted down the track, mud flicking up from its hooves. West gaped after\nhim for a moment.\n“Damn it,” he whispered. The stubborn old fool would most likely get\nthrown and break his thick neck. Then where would they be? Prince Ladisla\nwould have to take command. West shivered at the prospect, and kicked his\nown horse into a gallop. What choice did he have?\nThe trees flashed past on either side, the road flowed by underneath him.\nHis ears filled with the clattering of hooves, the rattling of harness. The\nwind rushed in his mouth, stung his eyes. The snowflakes came at him,\nstraight on. West snatched a look over his shoulder. The guards were\ntangled up with each other, horses jostling, lagging far back down the road.\nIt was the best he could do to keep up and stay in his saddle at the same\ntime. The last time he’d ridden so hard had been years ago, pounding across\na dry plain with a wedge of Gurkish cavalry just behind him. He’d hardly\nbeen any more scared then. His hands were gripping the reins painfully\ntight, his heart was hammering with fear and excitement. He realised that he\nwas smiling. Burr had been right. It did make him feel alive.\nThe Lord Marshal had slowed, and West reined his own horse in as he\ndrew level. He was laughing now, and he could hear Burr chuckling beside\nhim. He hadn’t laughed like that in months. Years maybe, he couldn’t\nremember the last time. Then he noticed something out of the corner of his\neye.\nHe felt a sickening jolt, a crushing pain in his chest. His head snapped\nforward, the reins were ripped from his hands, everything turned upside\ndown. His horse was gone. He was rolling on the ground, over and over.\nHe tried to get up and the world lurched. Trees and white sky, a horse’s\nkicking legs, dirt flying. He stumbled and pitched into the road, took a\nmouthful of mud. Someone helped him up, pulling roughly at his coat,\ndragging him into the woods.\n“No,” he gasped, hardly able to breathe for the pain in his chest. There\nwas no reason to go that way.\nA black line between the trees. He staggered forward, bent double,\ntripping over the tails of his coat, crashing through the undergrowth. A rope\nacross the road, pulled tight as they passed. Someone was half dragging\nhim, half carrying him. His head was spinning, all sense of direction lost. A\ntrap. West fumbled for his sword.

He could see\nthe guards flashing by through the trees, no more than a dozen strides away,\nbut he was powerless.\nHe bit the hand, as hard as he could, but it only gripped tighter,\nsqueezing his jaw, crushing his lips. He could taste blood. His own blood\nmaybe, or blood from the hand. The sound of the guards faded into the\nwoods and was gone, and fear pressed in behind it. The hand let go, gave\nhim a parting shove, and he tumbled onto his back.\nA face swam into view above him. A hard, gaunt, brutish face, black hair\nhacked short, teeth bared in an animal scowl, cold, flat eyes, brimful of fury.\nThe face turned and spat on the ground. There was no ear on the other side\nof it. Just a flap of pink scar, and a hole.\nNever in his life had West seen such an evil-looking man. The whole set\nof him was violence itself. He looked strong enough to tear West in half,\nand more than willing to do it. There was blood running from a wound in\nhis hand. The wound that West’s teeth had made. It dripped from his\nfingertips onto the forest floor. In his other fist he held a length of smooth\nwood. West’s eyes followed it, horrified. There was a heavy, curved blade at\nthe end, polished bright. An axe.\nSo this was a Northman. Not the kind who rolled drunk in the gutters of\nAdua. Not the kind who had come to his father’s farm to beg for work. The\nother kind. The kind his mother had scared him with stories of when he was\na child. A man whose work, and whose pastime, and whose purpose, was to\nkill. West looked from that hard blade to those hard eyes and back, numb\nwith horror. He was finished. He would die here in the cold forest, down in\nthe dirt like a dog.\nWest dragged himself up by one hand, seized by a sudden impulse to\nrun. He looked over his shoulder, but there was no escape that way. A man\nwas moving through the trees towards them. A big man with a thick beard\nand a sword over his shoulder, carrying a child in his arms. West blinked,\ntrying to get some sense of scale. It was the biggest man he had ever seen,\nand the child was Lord Marshal Burr. The giant tossed his burden down on\nthe ground like a bundle of sticks.

I thought\nyou said they got no guts, these Southerners?”\n“It was brains I said they was short on.” The one-eared man glowered\ndown at West the way a hungry cat looks at a bird. “And I’ve yet to see\notherwise.”\n“I think it’s this one.” The leader was looking down at Burr. “You\nBurr?” he asked in the common tongue.\nThe Lord Marshal looked at West, then up at the towering Northmen,\nthen he got slowly to his feet.

If you mean to kill us, you should do it now.” West stayed\nwhere he was. Dignity hardly seemed worth the effort now. He could almost\nfeel the axe biting into his head already.\nBut the Northman with the grey in his beard only smiled. “I can see how\nyou’d make that mistake, and we’re sorry if we’ve frayed your nerves at all,\nbut we’re not here to kill you. We’re here to help you.” West struggled to\nmake sense of what he was hearing.\nBurr was doing the same. “To help us?”\n“There’s plenty in the North who hate Bethod. There’s plenty who don’t\nkneel willing, and some who don’t kneel at all. That’s us. We’ve a feud with\nthat bastard has been a long time brewing, and we mean to settle it, or die in\nthe trying. We can’t fight him alone, but we hear you’re fighting him, so we\nreckoned we’d join you.”\n“Join us?”\n“We came a long way to do it, and from what we seen on the way you\ncould use the help. But when we got here, your people weren’t keen to take\nus.”\n“They was somewhat rude,” said the lean one, squatting next to West.\n“They was indeed, Dogman, they was indeed. But we ain’t men to back\noff at a little rudeness. That’s when I hit on the notion of talking to you,\nchief to chief, you might say.”\nBurr stared over at West. “They want to fight with us,” he said. West\nblinked back, still trying to come to terms with the notion that he might live\nout the day. The one called Dogman was holding out a sword towards him,\nhilt first, and grinning. It took West a moment to realise it was his own.\n“Thanks,” muttered West as he fumbled with the grip.\n“No bother.”\n“There’s five of us,” the leader was saying, “all Named Men and\nveterans. We’ve fought against Bethod, and we’ve fought with him, all\nacross the North. We know his style, few better. We can scout, we can fight,\nwe can lay surprises, as you see. We’ll not shirk any task worth the doing,\nand any task that hurts Bethod is worth it to us. What do you say?”\n“Well… er,” murmured Burr, rubbing his chin with his thumb. “You\nplainly are a most”—and he looked from one hard, dirty, scarred face to the\nnext—“useful set of men. How could I resist an offer so graciously made?”\n“Then I better make the introductions. This here is the Dogman.”\n“That’s me,” growled the lean one with the pointy teeth, flashing his\nworrying grin again. “Good to meet.” He grabbed hold of West’s hand and\nsqueezed it until his knuckles clicked.\nThreetrees jerked his thumb sideways at the evil one with the axe and\nthe missing ear. “This friendly fellow’s Black Dow.

They call him the Thunderhead. Then there’s Harding\nGrim. He’s off out there in the trees, keeping your horses off the road. Not\nto worry, though, he’d have nothing to say.”\n“And you?”\n“Rudd Threetrees. Leader of this little crew, on account of our previous\nleader having gone back to the mud.”\n“Back to the mud, I see.” Burr took a deep breath. “Well then. You can\nreport to Colonel West. I’m sure that he can find food and quarters for you,\nnot to mention work.”\n“Me?” asked West, sword still dangling from his hand.\n“Absolutely.” The Lord Marshal had the tiniest smile at the corner of his\nmouth. “Our new allies should fit right in with Prince Ladisla’s retinue.”\nWest couldn’t decide whether to laugh or cry. Just when he had thought his\nsituation could not be any more difficult, he had five primitives to handle.\nThreetrees seemed happy enough with the outcome. “Good,” he said,\nslowly nodding his approval. “That’s settled then.”\n“Settled,” said the Dogman, his evil smile growing wider still.\nThe one called Black Dow gave West a long, cold stare.\n“Fucking Union,” he growled.\nQuestions\nTo Sand dan Glokta, Superior of Dagoska, and for his eyes alone.\nYou will take ship immediately, and assume command of the\nInquisition in the city of Dagoska. You will establish what became of\nyour predecessor, Superior Davoust. You will investigate his\nsuspicion that a conspiracy is afoot, perhaps in the city’s ruling\ncouncil itself. You will examine the members of that council, and\nuproot any and all disloyalty. Punish treason with scant mercy, but\nensure that your evidence is sound. We can afford no further\nblunders.\nGurkish soldiers already crowd to the peninsula, ready to exploit\nany weakness. The King’s regiments are fully committed in Angland,\nso you can expect little help should the Gurkish attack. You will\ntherefore ensure that the defences of the city are strong, and that\nprovisions are sufficient to withstand any siege. You will keep me\ninformed of your progress in regular letters. Above all, you will\nensure that Dagoska does not, under any circumstances, fall into the\nhands of the Gurkish.\nDo not fail me.\nSult\nArch Lector of His Majesty’s Inquisition\nG\nlokta folded the letter carefully and slipped it back into his pocket,\nchecking once again that the King’s writ was safe beside it. Damn thing.\nThe big document had been weighing heavily in his coat ever since the\nArch Lector passed it to him. He pulled it out and turned it over in his\nhands, the gold leaf on the big red seal glittering in the harsh sunlight. A\nsingle sheet of paper, yet worth more than gold. Priceless. With this, I speak\nwith the King’s own voice. I am the most powerful man in Dagoska, greater\neven than the Lord Governor himself. All must hear me and obey. As long\nas I can stay alive, that is."

As long\nas I can stay alive, that is.\nThe voyage had not been a pleasant one. The ship was small and the\nCircle Sea had been rough on the way over. Glokta’s own cabin was tiny,\nhot and close as an oven. An oven swaying wildly all day and all night. If he\nhad not been trying to eat gruel with the bowl slopping crazily around, he\nhad been vomiting back up those small amounts he had actually managed to\nswallow. But at least belowdecks there was no chance of his useless leg\ngiving way and dumping him over the side into the sea. Yes, the voyage has\nhardly been pleasant.\nBut now the voyage was over. The ship was already slipping up to its\nmooring in amongst the crowded wharves. The sailors were already\nstruggling with the anchor, throwing ropes onto the dock. Now the\ngangplank was sliding across from ship to dusty shore.\n“Right,” said Practical Severard. “I’m going to get me a drink.”\n“Make it a strong one, but see you catch up with me later. We’ll have\nwork to do tomorrow. Lots of work.”\nSeverard nodded, lanky hair swaying around his thin face. “Oh, I live to\nserve.” I’m not sure what you live for, but I doubt it’s that. He sauntered off,\nwhistling tunelessly, clattered across the plank, down the wharf and off\nbetween the dusty brown buildings beyond.\nGlokta eyed the narrow length of wood with not a little worry, worked\nhis hand around the handle of his cane, tongued at his empty gums, building\nhimself up to stepping onto it. An act of selfless heroism indeed. He\nwondered for a moment whether he would be wiser to crawl across on his\nstomach. It would reduce the chance of a watery death, but it would hardly\nbe appropriate, would it? The city’s awe-inspiring Superior of the\nInquisition, slithering into his new domain on his belly?\n“Need a hand?” Practical Vitari was looking at him sideways, leaning\nback on the ship’s handrail, red hair sticking up off her head like the spines\non a thistle. She seemed to have spent the entire journey basking in the open\nair like a lizard, quite unmoved by the reeling of the ship, enjoying the\ncrushing heat every bit as much as Glokta despised it. It was hard to judge\nher expression beneath her black Practical’s mask. But it’s a good bet she’s\nsmiling. No doubt she’s already preparing her first report to the Arch\nLector: “The cripple spent most of the voyage belowdecks, puking. When\nwe arrived at Dagoska he had to be hoisted ashore with the cargo. Already\nhe has become a laughing stock…”\n“Of course not!” snapped Glokta, hobbling up onto the plank as though\nhe took his life in his hands every morning. It wobbled alarmingly as he\nplanted his right foot on it, and he became painfully aware of the grey-green\nwater slapping at the slimy stones of the quay a long drop below him.

Body\nfound floating by the docks…\nBut in the end he was able to shuffle across without incident, dragging\nhis withered leg behind him. He felt an absurd pang of pride when he made\nit to the dusty stones of the docks and finally stood on dry land again.\nRidiculous. Anyone would think I’d beaten the Gurkish and saved the city\nalready, rather than hobbled three strides. To add insult to injury, now that\nhe had become used to the constant lurching of the ship, the stillness of land\nwas making his head spin and his stomach roll, and the rotten salt stink of\nthe baking docks was very far from helping. He forced himself to swallow a\nmouthful of bitter spit, closed his eyes, and turned his face towards the\ncloudless sky.\nHell, but it’s hot. Glokta had forgotten how hot the South could be. Late\nin the year, and still the sun was blazing down, still he was running with\nsweat under his long black coat. The garments of the Inquisition may be\nexcellent for instilling terror in a suspect, but I fear they are poorly suited\nto a hot climate.\nPractical Frost was even worse off. The hulking albino had covered\nevery exposed inch of his milky skin, even down to black gloves and a wide\nhat. He peered up at the brilliant sky, pink eyes narrowed with suspicion\nand misery, broad white face beaded with sweat around his black mask.\nVitari peered sidelong at the pair of them. “You two really should get out\nmore,” she muttered.\nA man in Inquisitor’s black was waiting at the end of the wharf, sticking\nclose to the shade of a crumbling wall but still sweating generously. A tall,\nbony man with bulging eyes, his hooked nose red and peeling from\nsunburn. The welcoming committee? Judging by its scale, I am scarcely\nwelcome at all.\n“I am Harker, senior Inquisitor in the city.”\n“Until I arrived,” snapped Glokta. “How many others have you?”\nThe Inquisitor frowned. “Four Inquisitors and some twenty Practicals.”\n“A small complement to keep a city of this size free of treason.”\nHarker’s frown grew more surly yet. “We’ve always managed.” Oh,\nindeed. Apart from mislaying your Superior, of course. “This is your first\nvisit to Dagoska?”\n“I have spent some time in the South.” The best days of my life, and the\nworst. “I was in Gurkhul during the war. I saw Ulrioch.” In ruins after we\nburned the city. “And I was in Shaffa for two years.” If you count the\nEmperor’s prisons. Two years in the boiling heat and the crushing darkness.\nTwo years in hell. “But I have never been to Dagoska.”\n“Huh,” snorted Harker, unimpressed. “Your quarters are in the Citadel.”\nHe nodded towards the great rock that loomed up over the city. Of course\nthey are. In the very highest part of the highest building, no doubt. “I’ll\nshow you the way. Lord Governor Vurms and his council will be keen to"

I’m delighted to disappoint you.\nHarker set off into the city at a brisk pace, Practical Frost trudging along\nbeside him, heavy shoulders hunched around his thick neck, sticking to\nevery trace of shade as though the sun were shooting tiny darts at him.\nVitari zigzagged across the dusty street as if it was a dance floor, peering\nthrough windows and down narrow side streets. Glokta shuffled along\ndoggedly behind, his left leg already starting to burn with the effort.\n“The cripple shuffled only three strides into the city before he fell on his\nface, and had to be carried the rest of the way by stretcher, squealing like a\nhalf-slaughtered pig and begging for water, while the very citizens he was\nsent to terrify watched, dumbstruck…”\nHe curled his lips back and dug his remaining teeth into his empty gums,\nforced himself to keep pace with the others, the handle of his cane cutting\ninto his palm, his spine giving an agonising click with every step.\n“This is the Lower City,” grumbled Harker over his shoulder, “where the\nnative population are housed.”\nA giant, boiling, dusty, stinking slum. The buildings were mean and\nbadly maintained: rickety shacks of one storey, leaning piles of half-baked\nmud bricks. The people were all dark-skinned, poorly dressed, hungry-\nlooking. A bony woman peered out at them from a doorway. An old man\nwith one leg hobbled past on bent crutches. Down a narrow alley ragged\nchildren darted between piles of refuse. The air was heavy with the stink of\nrot and bad sewers. Or no sewers at all. Flies buzzed everywhere. Fat,\nangry flies. The only creatures prospering here.\n“If I’d known it was such a charming place,” observed Glokta, “I’d have\ncome sooner. Seems the Dagoskans have done well from joining the Union,\neh?”\nHarker did not recognise the irony. “They have indeed. During the short\ntime the Gurkish controlled the city, they took many of the leading citizens\nas slaves. Now, under the Union, they are truly free to work and live as they\nplease.”\n“Truly free, eh?” So this is what freedom looks like. Glokta watched a\ngroup of sullen natives crowding round a stall poorly stocked with half-\nrotten fruit and flyblown offal.\n“Well, mostly.” Harker frowned. “The Inquisition had to weed out a few\ntroublemakers when we first arrived. Then, three years ago, the ungrateful\nswine mounted a rebellion.” After we gave them the freedom to live like\nanimals in their own city? Shocking. “We got the better of them, of course,\nbut they caused no end of damage. After that they were barred from keeping\nweapons, or entering the Upper City, where most of the whites live. Since\nthen, things have been quiet. It only goes to show that a firm hand is most\neffective when it comes to dealing with these primitives.”"

It only goes to show that a firm hand is most\neffective when it comes to dealing with these primitives.”\n“They built some impressive defences, for primitives.”\nA high wall cut through the city before them, casting a long shadow over\nthe squalid buildings of the slum. There was a wide pit in front, freshly dug\nand lined with sharpened stakes. A narrow bridge led across to a tall gate,\nset between looming towers. The heavy doors were open, but a dozen men\nstood before them: sweating Union soldiers in steel caps and studded\nleather coats, harsh sun glinting on their swords and spears.\n“A well-guarded gate,” mused Vitari. “Considering that it’s inside the\ncity.”\nHarker frowned. “Since the rebellion, natives have only been allowed\nwithin the Upper City if they have a permit.”\n“And who holds a permit?” asked Glokta.\n“Some skilled craftsmen and so forth, still employed by the Guild of\nSpicers, but mostly servants who work in the Upper City and the Citadel.\nMany of the Union citizens who live here have native servants, some have\nseveral.”\n“Surely the natives are citizens of the Union also?”\nHarker curled his lip. “If you say so, Superior, but they can’t be trusted,\nand that’s a fact. They don’t think like us.”\n“Really?” If they think at all it will be an improvement on this savage.\n“They’re all scum, these browns. Gurkish, Dagoskan, all the same.\nKillers and thieves, the lot of them. Best thing to do is to push them down\nand keep them down.” Harker scowled out at the baking slum. “If a thing\nsmells like shit, and is the colour of shit, the chances are it is shit.” He\nturned and stalked off across the bridge.\n“What a charming and enlightened man,” murmured Vitari. You read my\nmind.\nIt was a different world beyond the gates. Stately domes, elegant towers,\nmosaics of coloured glass, and pillars of white marble shone in the blazing\nsun. The streets were wide and clean, the residences well maintained. There\nwere even a few thirsty-looking palms in the neat squares. The people here\nwere sleek, well dressed, and white-skinned. Aside from a great deal of\nsunburn. A few dark faces moved among them, keeping well out of the way,\neyes on the ground. Those lucky enough to be allowed to serve? They must\nbe glad that we in the Union would not tolerate such a thing as slavery.\nOver everything Glokta could hear a rattling din, like a battle in the\ndistance. It grew louder as he dragged his aching leg through the Upper\nCity, and reached a furious pitch as they emerged into a wide square,\npacked from one edge to the other with a bewildering throng. There were\npeople of Midderland, and Gurkhul, and Styria, narrow-eyed natives of\nSuljuk, yellow-haired citizens of the Old Empire, bearded Northmen even,\nfar from home.\n“Merchants,” grunted Harker.

They crowded round stalls laden with produce, great scales for the\nweighing of materials, blackboards with chalked-in goods and prices. They\nbellowed, borrowed, and bartered in a multitude of different languages,\nthrew up their hands in strange gestures, shoved and tugged and pointed at\none another. They sniffed at boxes of spice and sticks of incense, fingered at\nbolts of cloth and planks of rare wood, squeezed at fruits, bit at coins,\npeered through eye-glasses at flashing gemstones. Here and there a native\nporter stumbled through the crowds, stooped double under a massive load.\n“The Spicers take a cut of everything,” muttered Harker, shoving\nimpatiently through the chattering press.\n“That must be a great deal,” said Vitari under her breath. A very great\ndeal, I should imagine. Enough to defy the Gurkish. Enough to keep a\nwhole city prisoner. People will kill for much, much less.\nGlokta grimaced and snarled his way across the square, jolted and\nbarged and painfully shoved at every limping step. It was only when they\nfinally emerged from the crowds at the far side that he realised they were\nstanding in the very shadow of a vast and graceful building, rising arch\nupon arch, dome upon dome, high over the crowds. Delicate spires at each\ncorner soared into the air, slender and frail.\n“Magnificent,” muttered Glokta, stretching out his aching back and\nsquinting up, the pure white stone almost painful to look at in the afternoon\nglare. “Seeing this, one could almost believe in God.” If one didn’t know\nbetter.\n“Huh,” sneered Harker. “The natives used to pray here in their\nthousands, poisoning the air with their damn chanting and superstition, until\nthe rebellion was put down, of course.”\n“And now?”\n“Superior Davoust declared it off-limits to them. Like everything else in\nthe Upper City. Now the Spicers use it as an extension to the marketplace,\nbuying and selling and so on.”\n“Huh.” How very appropriate. A temple to the making of money. Our\nown little religion.\n“I believe some bank uses part of it for their offices, as well.”\n“A bank? Which one?”\n“The Spicers run that side of things,” snapped Harker impatiently.\n“Valint and something, is it?”\n“Balk. Valint and Balk.” So some old acquaintances are here before me,\neh? I should have known. Those bastards are everywhere. Everywhere\nthere’s money. He peered round at the swarming marketplace. And there’s a\nlot of money here.\nThe way grew steeper as they began to climb the great rock, the streets\nbuilt onto shelves cut out from the dry hillside. Glokta laboured on through\nthe heat, stooped over his cane, biting his lip against the pain in his leg,\nthirsty as a dog and with sweat leaking out through every pore.

The Spicers’ guildhall is inside, and\nthe city’s House of Questions.”\n“Quite a view,” murmured Vitari.\nGlokta turned and shaded his eyes with his hand. Dagoska was spread\nout before them, almost an island. The Upper City sloped away, neat grids\nof neat houses with long, straight roads in between, speckled with yellow\npalms and wide squares. On the far side of its long, curving wall lay the\ndusty brown jumble of the slums. Looming over them in the distance,\nshimmering in the haze, Glokta could see the mighty land walls, blocking\nthe one narrow neck of rock that joined the city to the mainland, the blue\nsea on one side and the blue harbour on the other. The strongest defences in\nthe world, so they say. I wonder if we shall be putting that proud boast to\nthe test before too long?\n“Superior Glokta?” Harker cleared his throat. “The Lord Governor and\nhis council will be waiting.”\n“They can wait a little longer, then. I am curious to know what progress\nyou have made in investigating the disappearance of Superior Davoust.” It\nwould be most unfortunate if the new Superior were to suffer the same fate,\nafter all.\nHarker frowned. “Well… some progress. I have no doubt the natives are\nresponsible. They never stop plotting. Despite the measures Davoust took\nafter the rebellion, many of them still refuse to learn their place.”\n“I stand amazed.”\n“It is all too true, believe me. Three Dagoskan servants were present in\nthe Superior’s chambers on the night he disappeared. I have been\nquestioning them.”\n“And what have you discovered?”\n“Nothing yet, unfortunately. They have proved exceedingly stubborn.”\n“Then let us question them together.”\n“Together?” Harker licked his lips. “I wasn’t aware that you would want\nto question them yourself, Superior.”\n“Now you are.”\nO\nne would have thought it would be cooler, deep within the rock. But it\nwas every bit as hot as outside in the baking streets, without the mercy of\nthe slightest breeze. The corridor was silent, dead, and stuffy as a tomb.\nVitari’s torch cast flickering shadows into the corners, and the darkness\nclosed in fast behind them.\nHarker paused beside an iron-bound door, mopped fat beads of sweat\nfrom his face. “I must warn you, Superior, it was necessary to be quite…\nfirm with them. A firm hand is the best thing, you know.”\n“Oh, I can be quite firm myself, when the situation demands it. I am not\neasily shocked.”\n“Good, good.” The key turned in the lock, the door swung open, and a\nfoul smell washed out into the corridor.

The heat was crushing, the stench was\nappalling. It reminded Glokta of another cell. Further south, in Shaffa. Deep\nbeneath the Emperor’s palace. A cell in which I gasped away two years,\nsquealing in the blackness, scratching at the walls, crawling in my own\nfilth. His eye had begun to twitch, and he wiped it carefully with his finger.\nOne prisoner lay stretched out, his face to the wall, skin black with\nbruises, both legs broken. Another hung from the ceiling by his wrists,\nknees brushing the floor, head hanging limp, back whipped raw. Vitari\nstooped and prodded at one of them with her finger. “Dead,” she said\nsimply. She crossed to the other. “And this one. Dead a good while.”\nThe flickering light fell across a third prisoner. This one was alive. Just.\nShe was chained by hands and feet, face hollow with hunger, lips cracked\nwith thirst, clutching filthy, bloodstained rags to her. Her heels scraped at\nthe floor as she tried to push herself further back into the corner, gibbering\nfaintly in Kantic, one hand across her face to ward off the light. I remember.\nThe only thing worse than the darkness is when the light comes. The\nquestions always come with it.\nGlokta frowned, his twitching eyes moving from the two broken corpses\nto the cowering girl, his head spinning from the effort, and the heat, and the\nstink. “Well, this is very cosy. What have they told you?”\nHarker had his hand over his nose and mouth as he stepped reluctantly\ninto the cell, Frost looming just over his shoulder. “Nothing yet, but I—”\n“You’ll get nothing from these two, now, that’s sure. I hope they signed\nconfessions.”\n“Well… not exactly. Superior Davoust was never that interested in\nconfessions from the browns, we just, you know…”\n“You couldn’t even keep them alive long enough to confess?”\nHarker looked sullen. Like a child unfairly punished by his\nschoolmaster. “There’s still the girl,” he snapped.\nGlokta looked down at her, licking at the space where his front teeth\nused to be. There is no method here. No purpose. Brutality, for its own sake.\nI might almost be sickened, had I eaten anything today. “How old is she?”\n“Fourteen, perhaps, Superior, but I fail to see the relevance.”\n“The relevance, Inquisitor Harker, is that conspiracies are rarely led by\nfourteen-year-old girls.”\n“I thought it best to be thorough.”\n“Thorough? Did you even ask them any questions?”\n“Well, I—”\nGlokta’s cane cracked Harker cleanly across the face. The sudden\nmovement caused a stab of agony in Glokta’s side, and he stumbled on his\nweak leg and had to grab at Frost’s arm for support. The Inquisitor gave a\nsqueal of pain and shock, tumbled against the wall, and slid into the filth on\nthe cell floor."

Perhaps I\nshould start my investigations with the Inquisition itself!”\nPractical Frost loomed over Harker as he struggled to get up, and he\nshrank back down against the wall, blood starting to dribble from his nose.\n“No! No, please! It was an accident! I didn’t mean to kill them! I just\nwanted to know what happened!”\n“An accident? You’re a traitor or an utter incompetent, and I’ve no use\nfor either one!” He leaned down even lower, ignoring the pain shooting up\nhis back, his lips curling away to show his toothless smile. “I understand a\nfirm hand is most effective when dealing with primitives, Inquisitor. You\nwill find there are no firmer hands than mine. Not anywhere. Get this worm\nout of my sight!”\nFrost seized hold of Harker by his coat and hauled him bodily through\nthe filth towards the door. “Wait!” he wailed, clutching at the door frame.\n“Please! You can’t do this!” His cries faded down the corridor.\nVitari had a faint smile around her eyes, as though she had rather\nenjoyed the scene. “What about this mess?”\n“Get it cleaned up.” Glokta leaned against the wall, his side still pulsing\nwith pain, wiped sweat from his face with a trembling hand. “Wash it down.\nBury these bodies.”\nVitari nodded towards the one survivor. “What about her?”\n“Give her a bath. Clothes. Food. Let her go.”\n“Hardly worth giving her a bath if she’s going back to the Lower City.”\nShe has a point there. “Alright! She was Davoust’s servant, she can be\nmine. Put her back to work!” he shouted over his shoulder, already hobbling\nfor the door. He had to get out. He could hardly breathe in there.\nI\nam sorry to disappoint you all, but the walls are far from impregnable, not\nin their present poor condition…” The speaker trailed off as Glokta shuffled\nthrough the door into the meeting chamber of Dagoska’s ruling council.\nIt was as unlike the cell below as it was possible for a room to be. It is,\nin fact, the most beautiful room I ever saw. Every inch of wall and ceiling\nwas carved in the most minute detail: geometric patterns of frightening\nintricacy wound round scenes from Kantic legends in life-size, all painted\nin glittering gold and silver, vivid red and blue. The floor was a mosaic of\nwondrous complexity, the long table was inlaid with swirls of dark wood\nand chips of bright ivory, polished to a high sheen. The tall windows offered\na spectacular view over the dusty brown expanse of the city, and the\nsparkling bay beyond."

The tall windows offered\na spectacular view over the dusty brown expanse of the city, and the\nsparkling bay beyond.\nThe woman who rose to greet Glokta as he entered did not seem out of\nplace in the magnificent surroundings. Not in the slightest.\n“I am Carlot dan Eider,” she said, smiling easily and holding her hands\nout to him as though to an old friend, “Magister of the Guild of Spicers.”\nGlokta was impressed, he had to admit. If only by her stomach. Not even\nthe slightest sign of horror. She greets me as though I were not a disfigured,\ntwitching, twisted ruin. She greets me as though I looked as fine as she\ndoes. She wore a long gown in the style of the South: blue silk, trimmed\nwith silver, it shimmered around her in the cool breeze through the high\nwindows. Jewels of daunting value flashed on her fingers, on her wrists,\nround her throat. Glokta detected a strange scent as she came closer. Sweet.\nLike the spice that has made her so very rich, perhaps. The effect was far\nfrom wasted on him. I am still a man, after all. Just less so than I used to\nbe.\n“I must apologise for my attire, but Kantic garments are so much more\ncomfortable in the heat. I have become quite accustomed to them during my\nyears here.”\nHer apologising for her appearance is like a genius apologising for his\nstupidity. “Don’t mention it.” Glokta bowed as low as he could, given the\nuselessness of his leg and the sharp pain in his back. “Superior Glokta, at\nyour service.”\n“We are most glad to have you with us. We have all been greatly\nconcerned since the disappearance of your predecessor, Superior Davoust.”\nSome of you, I expect, have been less concerned than others.\n“I hope to shed some light on the matter.”\n“We all hope that you will.” She took Glokta’s elbow with an effortless\nconfidence. “Please allow me to make the introductions.”\nGlokta refused to be moved. “Thank you, Magister, but I believe I can\nmake my own.” He shuffled across to the table under his own power, such\nas it was. “You must be General Vissbruck, charged with the city’s\ndefence.” The General was in his middle forties, running slightly to\nbaldness, sweating abundantly in an elaborate uniform, buttoned all the way\nto the neck in spite of the heat. I remember you. You were in Gurkhul, in the\nwar. A Major in the King’s Own, and well known for being an ass. It seems\nyou have done well, at least, as asses generally do.\n“A pleasure,” said Vissbruck, scarcely even glancing up from his\ndocuments.\n“It always is, to renew an old acquaintance.”\n“We’ve met?”\n“We fought together in Gurkhul.”\n“We did?” A spasm of shock ran over Vissbruck’s sweaty face.\n“You’re… that Glokta?”\n“I am indeed, as you say, that Glokta.”\nThe General blinked. “Er, well, er… how have you been?”\n“In very great pain, thank you for asking, but I see that you have"

A positive honour, Your Grace.”\nThe old man was a caricature of decrepitude, shrunken into his great\nrobes of state like a withered plum in its furry skin. His hands seemed to\nshiver even in the heat, his head was shiny bald aside from a few white\nwisps. He squinted up at Glokta through weak and rheumy eyes.\n“What did he say?” The Lord Governor stared about him in confusion.\n“Who is this man?”\nGeneral Vissbruck leaned across, so close his lips almost brushed the old\nman’s ear. “Superior Glokta, Your Grace! The replacement for Davoust!”\n“Glokta? Glokta? Where the hell is Davoust anyway?” No one bothered\nto reply.\n“I am Korsten dan Vurms.” The Lord Governor’s son spoke his own\nname as though it was a magic spell, offered his hand to Glokta as though it\nwas a priceless gift. He was blond-haired and handsome, spread out\ncarelessly in his chair, a well-tanned glow of health about him, as lithe and\nathletic as his father was ancient and wizened. I despise him already.\n“I understand that you were once quite the swordsman.” Vurms looked\nGlokta up and down with a mocking smile. “I fence myself, and there’s\nreally no one here to challenge me. Perhaps we might have a bout?” I’d love\nto, you little bastard. If I still had my leg I’d give you a bout of the shits\nbefore I was done.\n“I did fence but, alas, I had to give it up. Ill health.” Glokta leered back a\ntoothless smile of his own. “I daresay I could still give you a few pointers,\nthough, if you’re keen to improve.” Vurms frowned at that, but Glokta had\nalready moved on. “You must be Haddish Kahdia.”\nThe Haddish was a tall, slender man with a long neck and tired eyes. He\nwore a simple white robe, a plain white turban wound about his head. He\nlooks no more prosperous than any of the other natives down in the Lower\nCity, and yet there is a certain dignity about him.\n“I am Kahdia, and I have been chosen by the people of Dagoska to\nspeak for them. But I no longer call myself Haddish. A priest without a\ntemple is no priest at all.”\n“Must we still hear about the temple?” whined Vurms.\n“I am afraid you must, while I sit on this council.” He looked back at\nGlokta. “So there is a new Inquisitor in the city? A new devil. A new bringer\nof death. Your comings and goings are of no interest to me, torturer.”\nGlokta smiled. Confessing his hatred for the Inquisition without even\nseeing my instruments.

But then his people can hardly be expected to have\nmuch love for the Union, they’re little better than slaves in their own city.\nCould he be our traitor?\nOr him? General Vissbruck seemed every inch a loyal military man, a\nman whose sense of duty was too strong, and whose imagination was too\nweak, for intrigue. But few men become Generals without looking to their\nown profit, without oiling the wheels, without keeping some secrets.\nOr him? Korsten dan Vurms was sneering at Glokta as though at a badly\ncleaned latrine he had to use. I’ve seen his like a thousand times, the\narrogant whelp. The Lord Governor’s own son, perhaps, but it’s plain\nenough he has no loyalty to anyone beyond himself.\nOr her? Magister Eider was all comely smiles and politeness, but her\neyes were hard as diamonds. Judging me like a merchant judges an\nignorant customer. There’s more to her than fine manners and a weakness\nfor foreign tailoring. Far more.\nOr him? Even the old Lord Governor seemed suspect now. Are his eyes\nand ears as bad as he claims? Or is there a hint of play-acting in his\nsquinting, his demands to know what’s going on? Does he already know\nmore than anyone?\nGlokta turned and limped towards the window, leaned against the\nbeautifully carved pillar beside it and peered out at the astonishing view, the\nevening sun still warm on his face. He could already feel the council\nmembers shifting restlessly, keen to be rid of him. I wonder how long before\nthey order the cripple out of their beautiful room? I do not trust a one of\nthem. Not a one. He smirked to himself. Precisely as it should be.\nIt was Korsten dan Vurms who lost patience first. “Superior Glokta,” he\nsnapped. “We appreciate your thoroughness in presenting yourself here, but\nI am sure you have urgent business to attend to. We certainly do.”\n“Of course.” Glokta hobbled back to the table with exaggerated\nslowness as if he were leaving the room. Then he slid out a chair and\nlowered himself into it, wincing at the pain in his leg. “I will try to keep my\ncomments to a minimum, at least to begin with.”\n“What?” said Vissbruck.\n“Who is this fellow?” demanded the Lord Governor, craning forward\nand squinting with his weak eyes. “What is going on here?”\nHis son was more direct. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” he\ndemanded. “Are you mad?” Haddish Kahdia began to chuckle softly to\nhimself. At Glokta, or at the rage of the others, it was impossible to say.\n“Please, gentlemen, please.” Magister Eider spoke softly, patiently. “The\nSuperior has only just arrived, and is perhaps ignorant of how we conduct\nbusiness in Dagoska. You must understand that your predecessor did not\nattend these meetings.

        "text": "attend these meetings. We have been governing this city successfully for\nseveral years, and—”\n“The Closed Council disagrees.” Glokta held up the King’s writ between\ntwo fingers. He let everyone look at it for a moment, making sure they\ncould see the heavy seal of red and gold, then he flicked it across the table.\nThe others stared over suspiciously as Carlot dan Eider picked up the\ndocument, unfolded it, and started to read. She frowned, then raised one\nwell-plucked eyebrow. “It seems that we are the ignorant ones.”\n“Let me see that!” Korsten dan Vurms snatched the paper out of her\nhands and started to read it. “It can’t be,” he muttered. “It can’t be!”\n“I’m afraid that it is.” Glokta treated the assembly to his toothless leer.\n“Arch Lector Sult is most concerned. He has asked me to look into the\ndisappearance of Superior Davoust, and also to examine the city’s defences.\nTo examine them carefully, and to ensure that the Gurkish stay on the other\nside of them. He has instructed me to use whatever measures I deem\nnecessary.” He gave a significant pause. “Whatever… measures.”\n“What is that?” grumbled the Lord Governor. “I demand to know what\nis going on!”\nVissbruck had the paper now. “The King’s writ,” he breathed, mopping\nhis sweaty forehead on the back of his sleeve, “signed by all twelve chairs\non the Closed Council. It grants full powers!” He laid it down gently on the\ninlaid tabletop, as though worried it might suddenly burst into flames. “This\nis—”\n“We all know what it is.” Magister Eider was watching Glokta\nthoughtfully, one fingertip stroking her smooth cheek. Like a merchant who\nsuddenly becomes aware that her supposedly ignorant customer has fleeced\nher, and not the other way around. “It seems Superior Glokta will be taking\ncharge.”\n“I would hardly say taking charge, but I will be attending all further\nmeetings of this council. You should consider that the first of a very great\nnumber of changes.” Glokta gave a comfortable sigh as he settled into his\nbeautiful chair, stretching out his aching leg, resting his aching back. Almost\ncomfortable. He glanced across the frowning faces of the city’s ruling\ncouncil. Except, of course, that one of these charming people is most likely\na dangerous traitor. A traitor who has already arranged the disappearance\nof one Superior, and may very well now be considering the removal of a\nsecond…\nGlokta cleared his throat. “Now then, General Vissbruck, what were you\nsaying as I arrived? Something about the walls?”\nThe Wounds of the Past\nT\nhe mistakes of old,” intoned Bayaz with the highest pomposity, “should\nbe made only once. Any worthwhile education, therefore, must be founded\non a sound understanding of history.”\nJezal gave vent to a ragged sigh. Why on earth the old man had\nundertaken to enlighten him was past his understanding. The towering self-\ninterest, perhaps, of the mildly senile was to blame. In any case, Jezal was\nunshakable in his determination not to learn a thing."

        "text": "interest, perhaps, of the mildly senile was to blame. In any case, Jezal was\nunshakable in his determination not to learn a thing.\n“… yes, history,” the Magus was musing, “there is a lot of history in\nCalcis…”\nJezal glanced around him, unimpressed in the extreme. If history was\nnothing more than age, then Calcis, ancient city-port of the Old Empire,\nwas plainly rich with it. If history went further—to grandeur, to glory, to\nsomething which stirred the blood—then it was conspicuously absent.\nDoubtless the city had been carefully laid out, with wide, straight streets\npositioned to give the traveller magnificent views. But what might once\nhave been proud civic vistas, the long centuries had reduced to panoramas\nof decay. Everywhere there were abandoned houses, empty windows and\ndoorways gazing sadly out into the rutted squares. They passed side streets\nchoked with weeds, with rubble, with rotting timbers. Half the bridges\nacross the sluggish river had collapsed and never been repaired; half the\ntrees in the broad avenues were dead and withered, throttled by ivy.\nThere was none of the sheer life that crammed Adua, from the docks, to\nthe slums, to the Agriont itself. Jezal’s home might have sometimes seemed\nswarming, squabbling, bursting at the seams with humanity, but as he\nwatched the few threadbare citizens of Calcis traipsing through their rotting\nrelic of a city, he was in no doubt which atmosphere he preferred.\n“… you will have many opportunities to improve yourself on this\njourney of ours, my young friend, and I suggest you take advantage of\nthem. Master Ninefingers in particular, is well worthy of study. I feel you\ncould learn a great deal from him…”\nJezal almost gasped with disbelief. “From that ape?”\n“That ape, as you say, is famous throughout the North. The Bloody-\nNine, they call him there. A name to fill strong men with fear or courage,\ndepending on which side they stand. A fighter and tactician of deep cunning\nand matchless experience. Above all, he has learned the trick of saying a\ngreat deal less than he knows.” Bayaz glanced across at him. “The precise\nopposite of some people I could name.”\nJezal frowned and hunched his shoulders. He could see nothing to be\nlearned from Ninefingers apart, perhaps, from how to eat with one’s hands\nand go days without washing.\n“The great forum,” muttered Bayaz as they passed into a wide, open\nspace. “The throbbing heart of the city.” Even he sounded disappointed.\n“Here the citizens of Calcis would come to buy and sell, to watch spectacles\nand hear cases at law, to argue philosophy and politics. In the Old Time it\nwould have been crammed shoulder to shoulder here, until late in the\nevening.”\nThere was ample space now. The vast paved area could easily have\naccommodated fifty times the sorry crowd that was gathered there. The\ngrand statues round the edge were stained and broken, their dirty pedestals\nleaning at all angles. A few desultory stalls were laid out in the centre,\ncrowded together like sheep in cold weather.\n“A shadow of its former glory. Still”—and Bayaz pointed out the"

Still”—and Bayaz pointed out the\ndishevelled sculptures—“these are the only occupants that need interest us\ntoday.”\n“Really, and they are?”\n“Emperors of the distant past, my boy, each with a tale to tell.”\nJezal groaned inwardly. He had nothing more than a passing interest in\nthe history of his own country, let alone that of some decaying backwater in\nthe far-flung west of the World. “There’s a lot of them,” he muttered.\n“And these are by no means all. The history of the Old Empire stretches\nback for many centuries.”\n“Must be why they call it old.”\n“Don’t try to be clever with me, Captain Luthar, you have not the\nequipment. While your forebears in the Union were running around naked,\ncommunicating by gestures and worshipping mud, here my master Juvens\nwas guiding the birth of a mighty nation, a nation that in scale and wealth,\nin knowledge and grandeur, has never been equalled. Adua, Talins, Shaffa,\nthey are but shadows of the wondrous cities that once thrived in the valley\nof the great River Aos. This is the cradle of civilisation, my young friend.”\nJezal glanced round him at the sorry statues, the rotting trees, the grimy,\nthe forlorn, the faded streets. “What went wrong?”\n“The failure of something great is never a simple matter, but where there\nis success and glory, there must also be failure and shame. Where there are\nboth, jealousies must simmer. Envy and pride led by slow degrees to\nsquabbles, then to feuds, then to wars. Two great wars that ended in terrible\ndisasters.” He stepped smartly towards the nearest of the statues. “But\ndisasters are not without their lessons, my boy.”\nJezal grimaced. He needed more lessons like he needed a dose of the\ncock-rot, and he in no sense felt himself to be anyone’s boy, but the old man\nwas not in the least put off by his reluctance.\n“A great ruler must be ruthless,” intoned Bayaz. “When he perceives a\nthreat against his person or authority, he must move swiftly, and with no\nspace left for regret. For an example, we need look no further than the\nEmperor Shilla.” He gazed up at the marble above them, its features all but\nentirely worn away by the weather. “When he suspected his chamberlain of\nharbouring pretensions to the throne, he ordered him put to death on the\ninstant, his wife and all his children strangled, his great mansion in Aulcus\nlevelled to the ground.” Bayaz shrugged. “All without the slightest shred of\nproof. An excessive and a brutal act, but better to act with too much force\nthan too little. Better to be held in fear, than in contempt. Shilla knew this.\nThere is no place for sentiment in politics, do you see?”\nI see that wherever I turn in life there’s always some fucking old dunce\ntrying to give me a lecture.

        "text": "I see that wherever I turn in life there’s always some fucking old dunce\ntrying to give me a lecture. That was what Jezal thought, but he was not\nabout to say it. The memory of a Practical of the Inquisition bursting apart\nbefore his very eyes was still horribly fresh in his mind. The squelching\nsound of the flesh. The feeling of spots of hot blood pattering across his\nface. He swallowed and looked down at his shoes.\n“I see,” he muttered.\nBayaz’s voice droned on. “Not that a great King need be a tyrant, of\ncourse! To gain the love of the common man should always be a ruler’s first\naim, for it can be won with small gestures, and yet can last a lifetime.”\nJezal was not about to let that pass, however dangerous the old man\nmight be. It was clear that Bayaz had no practical experience in the arena of\npolitics. “What use is the love of commoners? The nobles have the money,\nthe soldiers, the power.”\nBayaz rolled his eyes at the clouds. “The words of a child, easily tricked\nby flim-flam and quick hands. Where does the nobles’ money come from\nbut from taxes on the peasants in the fields? Who are their soldiers but the\nsons and husbands of common folk? What gives the lords their power?\nOnly the compliance of their vassals, nothing more. When the peasantry\nbecome truly dissatisfied, that power can vanish with terrifying speed. Take\nthe case of the Emperor Dantus.” He gestured up at one of the many statues,\none arm broken off at the shoulder, the other holding out a handful of scum\nin which a rich bloom of moss had taken hold. The loss of his nose, leaving\na grimy crater, had left the Emperor Dantus with an expression of eternal\nembarrassed bewilderment, like a man surprised whilst on the latrine.\n“No ruler has ever been more loved by his people,” said Bayaz. “He\ngreeted every man as his equal, always gave half his revenues to the poor.\nBut the nobles conspired against him, fixed on one of their number to\nreplace him, and threw the Emperor into prison while they seized the\nthrone.”\n“Did they really?” grunted Jezal, staring off across the half-empty\nsquare.\n“But the people would not abandon their beloved monarch. They rose\nfrom their homes and rioted, and would not be subdued. Some of the\nconspirators were dragged from their palaces and hung in the streets, the\nothers were cowed, and returned Dantus to his throne. So you see, my lad,\nthat the love of the people is a ruler’s surest shield against danger.”\nJezal sighed. “Give me the support of the lords every time.”\n“Hah. Their love is costly, and fickle as the changing wind. Have you\nnot stood in the Lords’ Round, Captain Luthar, while the Open Council is in\nsession?” Jezal frowned. Perhaps there was some grain of truth in the old\nman’s babble. “Hah. Such is the love of nobles. The best that one can do is\nto divide them and work on their jealousies, make them compete for small\nfavours, claim the credit for their successes, and most of all ensure that no"

An\nimpressive-seeming man in late middle age with a thick beard and curling\nhair. His face was handsome, but there was a grim set to his mouth, a proud\nand wrathful wrinkling of his brow. A man not to be fooled with.\n“That is my master, Juvens. Not an Emperor, but the first and last\nadviser to many. He built the Empire, yet he was also the principal in its\ndestruction. A great man, in so many ways, but great men have great faults.”\nBayaz turned his worn staff thoughtfully round in his hand.” One should\nlearn the lessons of history. The mistakes of the past need only be made\nonce.” He paused for a moment. “Unless there are no other choices.”\nJezal rubbed his eyes and stared across the forum. The Crown Prince\nLadisla, perhaps, might have benefited from such a lecture, but Jezal rather\ndoubted it. Was this why he had been torn away from his friends, from his\nhard-earned chance at glory and advancement? To listen to the dusty\nmusings of some strange, bald wanderer?\nHe frowned. There were a group of three soldiers moving towards them\nacross the square. At first he watched them, uninterested. Then he realised\nthey were looking right at him and Bayaz, and moving directly towards\nthem. Now he saw another group of three, and another, coming from\ndifferent directions.\nJezal’s throat felt tight. Their armour and weapons, though of an antique\ndesign, looked worryingly effective and well used. Fencing was one thing.\nActual fighting, with its possibilities for serious wounding and death, was\nquite another. It was not cowardice, surely, to feel worried, not with nine\narmed men very clearly approaching them, and no possible route of escape.\nBayaz had noticed them too. “A welcome appears to have been\nprepared.”\nThe nine closed in, faces hard, weapons firmly gripped. Jezal squared\nhis shoulders and did his best to look fearsome while meeting nobody’s eye,\nand keeping his hands well away from the hilts of his steels. He had no\nwish whatsoever for someone to get nervous, and stab him on a whim.\n“You are Bayaz,” said their leader, a heavy-set man with a grubby red\nplume on his helmet.\n“Is that a question?”\n“No. Our master, the Imperial Legate, Salamo Narba, Governor of\nCalcis, invites you to an audience.”\n“Does he indeed?” Bayaz glanced around at the party of soldiers, then\nraised an eyebrow at Jezal. “I suppose it would be rude of us to refuse,\nwhen the Legate has gone to all the trouble of organising an honour guard.\nLead the way.”\nS\nay one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say he’s in pain.

He’d spent most of his life in\nsome amount of pain, healing too slowly from one beating or another. He\nremembered the first real wound he’d ever taken, a cut down his face that\nthe Shanka had given him. Fifteen years old, lean and smooth-skinned, and\nthe girls in the village had still liked to look at him. He touched his thumb\nto his face and felt the old scar. He remembered his father pressing the\nbandage to his cheek in the smoky hall, the stinging of it, wanting to shout\nbut biting his lip. A man stays silent.\nWhen he can. Logen remembered lying on his face in a stinking tent\nwith the cold rain drumming on the canvas, biting on a piece of leather to\nkeep from screaming, coughing it out and screaming anyway while they\ndug in his back for an arrowhead that hadn’t come out with the shaft. It had\ntaken them a day of looking to find the bastard thing. Logen winced and\nwriggled his tingling shoulder blades at that memory. He hadn’t been able\nto talk for a week from all that screaming.\nHadn’t been able to talk for more than a week after the duel with\nThreetrees. Or walk, or eat, or see hardly. Broken jaw, broken cheek, ribs\nbroken past counting. Bones smashed until he was no more than aching,\ncrying, self-pitying goo, mewling like an infant at every movement of his\nstretcher, fed by an old woman with a spoon and grateful to get it.\nThere were plenty more memories, all crowding in and cutting at him.\nThe stump of his finger after the battle at Carleon, burning and burning and\nmaking him crazy. Waking up sudden after a day out cold, when he got\nknocked on the head up in the hills. Pissing red after Harding Grim’s spear\nhad pricked him through the guts. Logen felt them now on his tattered skin,\nall of his scars, and he hugged his arms around his aching body.\nThe wounds of the past were many, alright, but it didn’t make the ones\nhe had now hurt any less. The cut in his shoulder nagged at him, sore as a\nburning coal. He’d seen a man lose an arm from nothing more than a graze\nhe’d got in battle. First they had to take off his hand, then his arm to the\nelbow, then all the way to the shoulder. Next he got tired, then he started\ntalking stupid, then he stopped breathing. Logen didn’t want to go back to\nthe mud that way.\nHe hopped up to a crumbling stump of wall and leaned against it,\npainfully shrugged his coat off, fumbled at the buttons of his shirt with one\nclumsy hand, pulled the pin out of the bandage and peeled the dressing\ncarefully away.\n“How does it look?” he asked.\n“Like the parent of all scabs,” muttered Longfoot, peering at his\nshoulder."

I fear that my\nremarkable talents do not encompass medicine. One wound smells much\nlike another to me.” And he pushed the pin back through the bandage.\nLogen worked his shirt on. “You’d know if it was rotten, believe me.\nReeks like old graves, and once the rot gets in you, there’s no getting rid of\nit but with a blade. Bad way to go.” And he shuddered and pressed his palm\ngently against his throbbing shoulder.\n“Yes, well,” said Longfoot, already striding off down the near-deserted\nstreet. “Lucky for you that we have the woman Maljinn with us. Her talent\nfor conversation is most extremely limited, but when it comes to wounds,\nwell, I saw the whole business and don’t object to telling you, she can stitch\nskin as calm and even as a master cobbler stitches leather. She can indeed!\nShe pulls a needle as nimble and neat as a queen’s dressmaker. A useful\ntalent to have in these parts. I would not be the least surprised if we need\nthat talent again before we’re done.”\n“It’s a dangerous journey?” asked Logen, still trying to struggle back\ninto his coat.\n“Huh. The North has always been wild and lawless, heavy with bloody\nfeuds and merciless brigands. Every man goes armed to the teeth, and ready\nto kill at a moment’s notice. In Gurkhul foreign travellers stay free only on\nthe whim of the local governor, at risk of being taken as a slave at any\nmoment. Styrian cities sport thugs and cutpurses on every corner, if you can\neven get through their gates without being robbed by the authorities. The\nwaters of the Thousand Isles are thick with pirates, one for each merchant,\nit sometimes seems, while in distant Suljuk they fear and despise outsiders,\nand likely as not will hang you by your feet and cut your throat as soon as\ngive you directions. The Circle of the World is full of dangers, my nine-\nfingered friend, but if all that is not enough for you, and you yearn for more\nsevere peril, I suggest that you visit the Old Empire.”\nLogen got the feeling that Brother Longfoot was enjoying himself. “That\nbad?”\n“Worse, oh yes, indeed! Especially if, rather than simply visiting, one\nundertakes to cross the breadth of the country from one side to the other.”\nLogen winced. “And that’s the plan?”\n“That is, as you put it, the plan. For time out of mind, the Old Empire\nhas been riven by civil strife. Once a single nation with a single Emperor,\nhis laws enforced by a mighty army and a loyal administration, it has\ndissolved down the years into a boiling soup of petty princedoms, crackpot\nrepublics, city states, and tiny lordships, until few acknowledge any leader\nwho does not even now hold a sword over their heads.

The lines between\ntax and brigandage, between just war and bloody murder, between rightful\nclaim and fantasy have blurred and vanished. Hardly a year goes by without\nanother power-hungry bandit declaring himself king of the world. I\nunderstand there was a time, perhaps fifty years ago, when there were no\nfewer than sixteen Emperors at one moment.”\n“Huh. Fifteen more than you need.”\n“Sixteen more, some might say, and not a one of them friendly to\ntravellers. When it comes to getting murdered, the Old Empire presents a\nvictim with quite the dazzling choice. But one need not be killed by men.”\n“No?”\n“Oh, dear me, no! Nature has also placed many fearsome obstacles in\nour path, especially given that winter is now coming fast upon us.\nWestwards of Calcis stretches a wide and level plain, open grassland for\nmany hundreds of miles. In the Old Time, perhaps, much of it was settled,\ncultivated, crossed by straight roads of good stone in every direction. Now\nthe towns mostly lie in silent ruins, the land is storm-drenched wilderness,\nthe roads are trails of broken stones luring the unwary into sucking bogs.”\n“Bogs,” muttered Logen, slowly shaking his head.\n“And worse besides. The River Aos, greatest of all rivers within the\nCircle of the World, carves a deep and snaking valley through the midst of\nthis wasteland. We will have to cross it, but there are only two surviving\nbridges, one at Darmium, which is our best chance, another at Aostum, a\nhundred miles or more further west. There are fords, but the Aos is mighty,\nand fast-flowing, and the valley deep and dangerous.” Longfoot clicked his\ntongue. “That is before we reach the Broken Mountains.”\n“High, are they?”\n“Oh, extremely. Very high, and very perilous. Called Broken for their\nsteep cliffs, their jagged ravines, their sudden plunging drops. There are\nrumoured to be passes, but all the maps, if indeed there ever were any, were\nlost long ago. Having negotiated the mountains, we will take ship—”\n“You plan to carry a ship over the mountains?”\n“Our employer assures me he can get one on the other side, though how\nI do not know, for that land is almost utterly unknown. We will sail due\nwest to the island of Shabulyan, which they say rises from the ocean at the\nvery edge of the World.”\n“They say?”\n“Rumour is all that anyone knows of it. Even amongst the illustrious\norder of Navigators, I have heard of no man who lays claim to have set foot\nupon the place, and the brothers of my order are well known for… far-\nfetched claims, shall we say?”\nLogen scratched slowly at his face, wishing that he’d asked Bayaz his\nplans before. “It all sounds a long way.”\n“One could scarcely conceive, in fact, of a destination more remote.”\n“What’s there?”\nLongfoot shrugged. “You will have to ask our employer.

We have a great deal to do if we are to pose as merchants.”\n“Merchants?”\n“That is Bayaz’s plan. Merchants often risk the journey west from Calcis\nto Darmium, even beyond to Aostum. They are large cities still, and largely\ncut off from the outside world. The profits one can make carrying foreign\nluxuries to them—spices from Gurkhul, silks from Suljuk, chagga from the\nNorth—are astronomical. Why, you can triple your investment in a month,\nif you survive! Such caravans are a common sight, well armed and well\ndefended, of course.”\n“What about these looters and robbers wandering the plain? Aren’t\nmerchants just what they’re after?”\n“Of course,” said Longfoot. “It must be some other threat that this\ndisguise is intended to defend against. One directed specifically at us.”\n“At us? Another threat? We need more?” But Longfoot was already\nstriding out of earshot.\nI\nn one part of Calcis at least, the majesty of the past was not entirely faded.\nThe hall into which they were ushered by their guards, or their kidnappers,\nwas glorious indeed.\nTwo lines of columns, tall as forest trees, marched down either side of\nthe echoing space, carved from polished green stone fretted with glittering\nveins of silver. High above, the ceiling was painted a rich blue-black,\nmarked with a galaxy of shining stars, constellations picked out by golden\nlines. A deep pool of dark water filled the space before the door, perfectly\nstill, reflecting everything. Another shadowy hall below. Another shadowy\nnight sky beyond it.\nThe Imperial Legate lay sprawled out across a couch on a high dais at\nthe far end of the room, a table before him loaded with delicacies. He was a\nhuge man, round-faced and fleshy. Fingers heavy with golden rings\nsnatched up choice morsels and tossed them into his waiting mouth, eyes\nnever leaving his two guests, or his two prisoners, for a moment.\n“I am Salamo Narba, Imperial Legate and governor of the city of\nCalcis.” He worked his mouth, then spat out an olive stone, which pinged\ninto a dish. “You are the one they call the First of the Magi?”\nThe Magus inclined his bald head. Narba lifted up a goblet, holding the\nstem between his heavy forefinger and his heavy thumb, took a swig of\nwine, sloshed it slowly round in his mouth while he watched them, and\nswallowed. “Bayaz.”\n“The same.”\n“Hmm. I mean no offence”—here the Legate snatched up a tiny fork and\nspeared an oyster from its shell—“but your presence in this city concerns\nme. The political situation in the Empire is… volatile.” He picked up his\ngoblet. “Even more so than usual.” Swig, slosh, swallow. “The last thing\nthat I need is someone… upsetting the balance.”\n“More volatile than usual?” asked Bayaz. “I understood that Sabarbus\nhad finally calmed things.”"

        "text": "that I need is someone… upsetting the balance.”\n“More volatile than usual?” asked Bayaz. “I understood that Sabarbus\nhad finally calmed things.”\n“Calmed them under his boot, for a while.” The Legate tore a handful of\ndark grapes from a bunch and leaned back on his cushions, popping them\none by one into his gaping mouth. “But Sabarbus… is dead. Poison, they\nsay. His sons, Scario… and Goltus…, squabbled over his legacy… then\nmade war on each other. An exceptionally bloody war, even for this\nexhausted land.” And he spat the pips out onto the tabletop.\n“Goltus held the city of Darmium, in the midst of the great plain. Scario\nemployed his father’s greatest General, Cabrian, to take it under siege. Not\nlong ago, after five months of encirclement, starved of provisions, hopeless\nof relief… the city surrendered.” Narba bit into a ripe plum, juice running\ndown his chin.\n“So Scario is close to victory, then.”\n“Huh.” The Legate wiped his face with the tip of his little finger and\ntossed the unfinished fruit carelessly onto the table. “No sooner had Cabrian\nfinally taken the city, pillaged its treasures, and given it over to a brutal sack\nby his soldiers, than he installed himself in the ancient palace and\nproclaimed himself Emperor.”\n“Ah. You seem unmoved.”\n“I weep on the inside, but I have seen all this before. Scario, Goltus, and\nnow Cabrian. Three self-appointed Emperors, locked in a deadly struggle,\ntheir soldiers ravaging the land, while the few cities who have maintained\ntheir independence look on, horrified, and do their best to escape the\nnightmare unscathed.”\nBayaz frowned. “I mean to travel westwards. I must cross the Aos, and\nDarmium is the closest bridge.”\nThe Legate shook his head. “It is said that Cabrian, always eccentric, has\nlost his reason entirely. That he has murdered his wife and married his own\nthree daughters. That he has declared himself a living god. The city gates\nare sealed while he scours the city for witches, devils, and traitors. Every\nday there are new bodies hanging at the public gibbets he has raised on each\ncorner. No one is permitted either to enter or to leave. Such is the news\nfrom Darmium.”\nJezal was more than a little relieved to hear Bayaz say, “It must be\nAostum, then.”\n“Nobody will be crossing the river at Aostum any longer. Scario,\nrunning from his brother’s vengeful armies, fled across the bridge and had\nhis engineers bring it down behind him.”\n“He destroyed it?”\n“He did. A wonder of the Old Time, which stood for two thousand years.\nNothing remains. To add to your woes, there have been heavy rains and the\ngreat river runs swift and high. The fords are impassable. You will not cross\nthe Aos this year, I fear.”\n“I must.”\n“But you will not. If you wish for my advice, I would leave the Empire\nto its misery and return from whence you came.

Here in Calcis we have\nalways tried to plough a middle furrow, to remain neutral, and firmly aloof\nfrom the disasters that have befallen the rest of the land, one hard upon\nanother. Here we still cling to the ways of our forefathers.” He gestured at\nhimself. “The city is yet governed by an Imperial Legate, as it was in the\nOld Time, not ruled by some brigand, some petty chieftain, some false\nEmperor.” He waved a limp hand at the rich hall around them. “Here,\nagainst the odds, we have managed to retain some vestige of the glory of\nold, and I will not risk that. Your friend Zacharus was here, not but a month\nago.”\n“Here?”\n“He told me that Goltus was the rightful Emperor and demanded that I\nthrow my support behind him.

I give you three days to leave the city.”\nThere was a long, quiet pause as the last echoes of Narba’s speech faded.\nA long, breathless moment, and all the while Bayaz’s frown grew harder. A\nlong, expectant silence, but not quite empty. It was full of growing fear.\n“Have you confused me with some other man?” growled Bayaz, and\nJezal felt an urgent need to shuffle away from him and hide behind one of\nthe beautiful pillars. “I am the First of the Magi! The first apprentice of\ngreat Juvens himself!” His anger was like a great stone pressing on Jezal’s\nchest, squeezing the air from his lungs, crushing the strength from his body.\nHe held up his meaty fist. “This is the hand that cast down Kanedias! The\nhand that crowned Harod! You dare to give me threats? Is this what you call\nthe glory of old? A city shrunken in its crumbling walls like some withered\nold warrior cowering in the outsize armour of his youth?” Narba shrank\nbehind his silverware and Jezal winced, terrified that the Legate might\nexplode at any moment and shower the room with gore.\n“You think I care a damn for your broken piss-pot of a town?” thundered\nBayaz. “You give me three days? I’ll be gone in one!” And he turned on his\nheel and stalked across the polished floor towards the entrance, the ringing\nechoes of his voice still grating from the shining walls, the glittering\nceiling.\nJezal dithered a moment, weak and trembling, then shuffled guiltily\naway, following the First of the Magi past the Legate’s horrified,\ndumbstruck guards and out into the daylight.\nThe Condition of the Defences\nTo Arch Lector Sult, head of His Majesty’s Inquisition\nYour Eminence,\nI have acquainted the members of Dagoska’s ruling council with my\nmission.

I will be\nappraising the city’s defences as soon as possible, and will take any\nand all steps necessary to ensure that Dagoska is impregnable.\nYou will hear from me soon. Until then, I serve and obey.\nSand dan Glokta,\nSuperior of Dagoska\nT\nhe sun pressed down on the crumbling battlements like a great weight. It\npressed through Glokta’s hat and onto his stooped head. It pressed through\nGlokta’s black coat and onto his twisted shoulders. It threatened to squeeze\nthe water right out of him, squash the life right out of him, crush him to his\nknees. A cool autumn morning in charming Dagoska.\nWhile the sun attacked him from above, the salt wind came at him head-\non. It swept in off the empty sea and over the bare peninsula, hot and full of\nchoking dust, blasting the land walls of the city and scouring everything\nwith salty grit. It stung at Glokta’s sweaty skin, whipped the moisture from\nhis mouth, tickled at his eyes and made them weep stinging tears. Even the\nweather wants to be rid of me, it would seem.\nPractical Vitari teetered along the parapet beside him, arms outstretched\nlike a circus performer on the high rope. Glokta frowned up at her, a gangly\nblack shape against the brilliant sky. She could just as easily walk down\nhere, and stop making a spectacle of herself. But at least this way there is\nalways the chance of her falling off. The land walls were twenty strides high\nat the least. Glokta allowed himself the very slightest smile at the thought of\nthe Arch Lector’s favourite Practical slipping, sliding, tumbling from the\nwall, hands clutching at nothing. Perhaps a despairing scream as she fell to\nher death?\nBut she didn’t fall. Bitch. Considering her next report to the Arch Lector,\nno doubt. “The cripple continues to flounder like a landed fish. He has yet\nto uncover the slightest trace of Davoust, or any traitor, despite questioning\nhalf the city. The one man he has arrested is a member of his own\nInquisition…”\nGlokta shaded his eyes with his hand and squinted into the blinding sun.\nThe neck of rock that connected Dagoska with the mainland stretched away\nfrom him, no more than a few hundred strides across at its narrowest point,\nthe sparkling sea on both sides. The road from the city gates was a brown\nstripe through the yellow scrub, cutting southwards towards the dry hills on\nthe mainland. A few sorry-looking seabirds squawked and circled over the\ncauseway, but there were no other signs of life.\n“Might I borrow your eye-glass, General?”\nVissbruck flicked the eye-glass open and slapped it sulkily into Glokta’s\noutstretched hand. Plainly he feels he has better things to do than give me a\ntour of the defences.

Doing\nhis best to maintain his professional bearing. His bearing is the only\nprofessional thing about this imbecile, but, as the Arch Lector says, we must\nwork with the tools we have. Glokta raised the brass tube to his eye.\nThe Gurkish had built a palisade. A tall fence of wooden stakes that\nfringed the hills, cutting Dagoska off from the mainland. There were tents\nscattered about the other side, thin plumes of smoke rising from a cooking\nfire here or there. Glokta could just about make out tiny figures moving, sun\nglinting on polished metal. Weapons and armour, and plenty of both.\n“There used to be caravans from the mainland,” Vissbruck murmured.\n“Last year there were a hundred of them every day. Then the Emperor’s\nsoldiers started to arrive, and there were fewer traders. They finished the\nfence a couple of months ago. There hasn’t been so much as a donkey since.\nEverything has to come in by ship, now.”\nGlokta scanned across the fence, and the camps behind, from the sea on\none side to the sea on the other. Are they simply flexing their muscles,\nputting on a show of force? Or are they in deadly earnest? The Gurkish love\na good show, but they don’t mind a good fight either—that’s how they’ve\nconquered the whole of the South, more or less. He lowered the eye-glass.\n“How many Gurkish, do you think?”\nVissbruck shrugged. “Impossible to say. At least five thousand, I would\nguess, but there could be many more, behind those hills. We have no way of\nknowing.”\nFive thousand. At the least. If it’s a show, it’s a good one. “How many\nmen have we?”\nVissbruck paused. “I have around six hundred Union soldiers under my\ncommand.”\nAround six hundred? Around? You lackwit dunce! When I was a soldier I\nknew the name of every man in my regiment, and who was best suited to\nwhat tasks. “Six hundred? Is that all?”\n“There are mercenaries in the city also, but they cannot be trusted, and\nfrequently cause trouble of their own. In my opinion they are worse than\nworthless.”\nI asked for numbers, not opinions. “How many mercenaries?”\n“Perhaps a thousand, now, perhaps more.”\n“Who leads them?”\n“Some Styrian. Cosca, he calls himself.”\n“Nicomo Cosca?” Vitari was staring down from the parapet, one orange\neyebrow raised.\n“You know him?”\n“You could say that. I thought he was dead, but it seems there’s no\njustice in the world.”\nShe’s right there. Glokta turned to Vissbruck. “Does this Cosca answer\nto you?”\n“Not exactly. The Spicers pay him, so he answers to Magister Eider. In\ntheory, he’s supposed to follow my orders—”\n“But he only follows his own?” Glokta could see in the General’s face\nthat he was right.

A double-edged sword, if ever there was\none. Keen, as long as you can keep paying, and provided that\ntrustworthiness is not a priority. “And Cosca’s men outnumber yours two to\none.” It would appear that, as far as the defences of the city are concerned,\nI am speaking to the wrong man. Perhaps there is one issue, though, on\nwhich he can enlighten me. “Do you know what became of my predecessor,\nSuperior Davoust?”\nGeneral Vissbruck twitched his annoyance. “I have no idea. That man’s\nmovements were of no interest to me.”\n“Hmm,” mused Glokta, jamming his hat down tighter onto his head as\nanother gritty gust of wind blew in across the walls. “The disappearance of\nthe city’s Superior of the Inquisition? Of no interest whatsoever?”\n“None,” snapped the General. “We rarely had cause to speak to one\nanother. Davoust was well-known as an abrasive character. As far as I am\nconcerned, the Inquisition has its responsibilities, and I have mine.” Touchy,\ntouchy. But then everyone is, since I arrived in town. You’d almost think\nthey didn’t want me here.\n“You have your responsibilities, eh?” Glokta shuffled to the parapet,\nlifted his cane, and prodded at a corner of crumbling masonry, not far from\nVitari’s heel. A chunk of stone cracked away and tumbled from the wall into\nspace. A few moments later he heard it clatter into the ditch, far below. He\nrounded on Vissbruck. “As commander of the city’s defences, would you\ncount the maintenance of the walls as being among your responsibilities?”\nVissbruck bristled. “I have done everything possible!”\nGlokta counted the points off with the fingers of his free hand. “The land\nwalls are crumbling and poorly manned. The ditch beyond is so choked\nwith dirt it barely exists. The gates have not been replaced in years, and are\nfalling to pieces on their own. If the Gurkish were to attack tomorrow, I do\nbelieve we’d be in quite a sorry position.”\n“Not for any oversight on my part, I can assure you! With the heat, and\nthe wind, and the salt from the sea, wood and metal rot in no time, and\nstone fares little better! Do you realise the task?” The General gestured at\nthe great sweep of the towering land walls, curving away to the sea on\neither side. Even here at the top, the parapet was wide enough to drive a cart\ndown, and they were a lot thicker at the base. “I have few skilled masons,\nand precious little materials! What the Closed Council gives me barely pays\nfor the upkeep of the Citadel! Then the money from the Spicers scarcely\nkeeps the walls of the Upper City in good repair—”\nFool! One could almost believe he did not seriously mean to defend the\ncity at all. “The Citadel cannot be supplied by sea if the rest of Dagoska is\nin Gurkish hands, am I right?”\nVissbruck blinked. “Well, no, but—”"

Time for help to arrive. Help that,\nwith our army committed hundreds of leagues away in Angland, might take\na while appearing.” Will never appear at all. “If the land walls fall, the city\nis doomed.” Glokta tapped the dusty flags underfoot with his cane. “Here is\nwhere we must fight the Gurkish, and here is where we must keep them out.\nEverything else is an irrelevance.”\n“An irrelevance,” Vitari piped to herself as she hopped from one part of\nthe parapet to another.\nThe General was frowning. “I can only do as the Lord Governor and his\ncouncil instruct me. The Lower City has always been regarded as\ndispensable. I am not responsible for overall policy—”\n“I am.” Glokta held Vissbruck’s eye for a very long moment. “From now\non all resources will be directed into the repair and strengthening of the land\nwalls. New parapets, new gates, every broken stone must be replaced. I\ndon’t want to see a crack an ant could crawl through, let alone a Gurkish\narmy.”\n“But who will do the work?”\n“The natives built the damn things in the first place, didn’t they? There\nmust be skilled men among them. Seek them out and hire them. As for the\nditch, I want it down below sea level. If the Gurkish come, we can flood it,\nand make the city into an island.”\n“But that could take months!”\n“You have two weeks. Perhaps not even that long. Press every idle man\ninto service. Women and children too, if they can hold a spade.”\nVissbruck frowned up at Vitari. “And what about your people in the\nInquisition?”\n“Oh, they’re too busy asking questions, trying to find out what happened\nto your last Superior. Or they’re watching me, and my quarters, and the\ngates of the Citadel all day and night, trying to make sure that the same\nthing doesn’t happen to your new one.

He can go back and explain his reluctance to the Arch\nLector.” Glokta leered his toothless smile at the General. “There’s no one\nthat can’t be replaced, General, no one at all.”\nThere was a great deal of sweat on Vissbruck’s pink face, great drops of"

His Eminence will provide.” He’d\nbetter. “I want reports on your progress every morning.”\n“Every morning, yes.”\n“You have a great deal to do, General. I’d get started.”\nVissbruck paused for a moment, as though unsure whether to salute or\nnot. In the end he simply turned on his heel and stalked off. The pique of a\nprofessional soldier dictated to by a civilian, or something more? Am I\nupsetting his carefully laid plans? Plans to sell the city to the Gurkish,\nperhaps?\nVitari hopped down from the parapet onto the walkway. “‘His Eminence\nwill provide’? You’d be lucky.”\nGlokta frowned at her back as she sauntered away, then he frowned\ntowards the hills on the mainland, then he frowned up at the Citadel.\nDangers on every side. Trapped between the Arch Lector and the Gurkish,\nand with nobody but an unknown traitor for company. It’ll be a wonder if I\nlast a day.\nA\ncommitted optimist might have called the place a dive. But it scarcely\ndeserves the name. A piss-smelling shack with some oddments of furniture,\neverything stained with ancient sweat and recent spillages. A kind of cesspit\nwith half the cess removed. Customers and staff were indistinguishable:\ndrunken, flyblown natives stretched out in the heat. Nicomo Cosca, famed\nsoldier of fortune, sprawled in amongst this scene of debauchery, soundly\nasleep.\nHe had his driftwood chair rocked back on its rear legs against the grimy\nwall, one boot up on the table in front of him. It had probably been as fine\nand flamboyant a boot as one could hope for once, black Styrian leather\nwith a golden spur and buckles. No longer. The upper was sagging and\nscuffed grey with hard use. The spur was snapped off short, the gilt on the\nbuckles was flaking away, and the iron underneath was spotted with brown\nrust. A circle of pink, blistered skin peered at Glokta through a hole in the\nsole.\nAnd a boot could scarcely be better fitted to its owner. Cosca’s long\nmoustaches, no doubt meant to be waxed out sideways in the fashion of a\nStyrian dandy, flopped limp and lifeless round his half-open mouth. His\nneck and jaw were covered in a week’s growth, somewhere between beard\nand stubble, and there was a scabrous, flaking rash peering out above his\ncollar.

His greasy hair stuck from his head at all angles, excepting a large\nbald spot on his crown, angry red with sunburn. Sweat beaded his slack\nskin, a lazy fly crawled across his puffy face. One bottle lay empty on its\nside on the table. Another, half-full, was cradled in his lap.\nVitari stared down at this picture of drunken self-neglect, expression of\ncontempt plainly visible despite her mask. “So it’s true then, you are still\nalive.” Just barely.\nCosca prised open one red-rimmed eye, blinked, squinted up, and then\nslowly began to smile. “Shylo Vitari, I swear. The world can still surprise\nme.” He worked his mouth, grimacing, glanced down and saw the bottle in\nhis lap, lifted it and took a long, thirsty pull. Deep swallows, just as if it\nwere water in the bottle. A practised drunkard, as though there was any\ndoubt. Hardly the man one would choose to entrust the defence of the city\nto, at first glance. “I never expected to see you again. Why don’t you take\noff the mask? It’s robbing me of your beauty.”\n“Save it for your whores, Cosca. I don’t need to catch what you’ve got.”\nThe mercenary gave a bubbling sound, half laugh, half cough. “You still\nhave the manners of a princess,” he wheezed.\n“Then this shithouse must be a palace.”\nCosca shrugged. “It all looks the same if you’re drunk enough.”\n“You think you’ll ever be drunk enough?”\n“No. But it’s worth trying.” As if to prove the point he sucked another\nmouthful from the bottle.\nVitari perched herself on the edge of the table. “So what brings you\nhere? I thought you were busy spreading the cock-rot across Styria.”\n“My popularity at home had somewhat dwindled.”\n“Found yourself on both sides of a fight once too often, eh?”\n“Something like that.”\n“But the Dagoskans welcomed you with open arms?”\n“I’d rather you welcomed me with open legs, but a man can’t get\neverything he wants. Who’s your friend?”\nGlokta slid out a rickety chair with one aching foot and eased himself\ninto it, hoping it would bear his weight. Crashing to the floor in a bundle of\nbroken sticks would hardly send the right message, now, would it? “My\nname is Glokta.” He stretched his sweaty neck out to one side, and then the\nother. “Superior Glokta.”\nCosca looked at him for a long time. His eyes were bloodshot, sunken,\nheavy-lidded. And yet there is a certain calculation there. Not half as drunk\nas he pretends, perhaps. “The same one who fought in Gurkhul? The\nColonel of Horse?”\nGlokta felt his eyelid flicker. You could hardly say the same man, but\nsurprisingly well remembered, nonetheless. “I gave up soldiery some years\nago. I’m surprised you’ve heard of me.”\n“A fighting man should know his enemies, and a hired man never knows"

I’m surprised you’ve heard of me.”\n“A fighting man should know his enemies, and a hired man never knows\nwho his next enemy might be. It’s worth taking notice of who’s who, in\nmilitary circles. I heard your name mentioned, some time ago, as a man\nworth taking notice of. Bold and clever, I heard, but reckless. That was the\nlast I heard. And now here you are, in a different line of work. Asking\nquestions.”\n“Recklessness didn’t work out for me in the end.” Glokta shrugged.\n“And a man needs something to do with his time.”\n“Of course. Never doubt another’s choices, I say. You can’t know his\nreasons. You come here for a drink, Superior? They’ve nothing but this piss,\nI’m afraid.” He waved the bottle. “Or have you questions for me?”\nThat I have, and plenty of them. “Do you have any experience with\nsieges?”\n“Experience?” spluttered Cosca, “Experience, you ask? Hah! Experience\nis one thing I am not short of—”\n“No,” murmured Vitari over her shoulder, “just discipline and loyalty.”\n“Yes, well”—Cosca frowned up at her back—“that all depends on who\nyou ask. But I was at Etrina, and at Muris. Serious pair of sieges, those. And\nI besieged Visserine myself for a few months and nearly had it, except that\nshe-devil Mercatto caught me unawares. Came on us with cavalry before\ndawn, sun behind and all, damned unfriendly trick, the bitch—”\n“I heard you were passed out drunk at the time,” muttered Vitari.\n“Yes, well… Then I held Borletta against Grand Duke Orso for six\nmonths—”\nVitari snorted. “Until he paid you to open the gates.”\nCosca gave a sheepish grin. “It was an awful lot of money. But he never\nfought his way in! You’d have to give me that, eh, Shylo?”\n“No one needs to fight you, providing they bring their purse.”\nThe mercenary grinned. “I am what I am, and never claimed to be\nanything else.”\n“So you’ve been known to betray an employer?” asked Glokta.\nThe Styrian paused, the bottle halfway to his mouth. “I am thoroughly\noffended, Superior. Nicomo Cosca may be a mercenary, but there are still\nrules. I could only turn my back on an employer under one condition.”\n“Which is?”\nCosca grinned. “If someone else were to offer me more.”\nAh, the mercenary’s code. Some men will do anything for money. Most\nmen will do anything for enough. Perhaps even make a Superior of the\nInquisition disappear? “Do you know what became of my predecessor,\nSuperior Davoust?”\n“Ah, the riddle of the invisible torturer!” Cosca scratched thoughtfully at\nhis sweaty beard, picked a little at the rash on his neck, and examined the\nresults, wedged under his fingernail. “Who knows or cares to know?

He had\nplenty of enemies, and, in case you hadn’t noticed, it’s a real snake pit down\nhere. If you’re asking which one bit him, well… isn’t that your job? I was\nbusy here. Drinking.”\nNot too difficult to believe. “What would your opinion be of our mutual\nfriend, General Vissbruck?”\nCosca hunched his shoulders and sank a little lower into his chair. “The\nman’s a child. Playing soldiers. Tinkering with his little castle and his little\nfence, when the big walls are all that count. Lose those and the game is\ndone, I say.”\n“I’ve been thinking the very same thing.” Perhaps the defence of the city\ncould be in worse hands, after all. “Work has already begun on the land\nwalls, and on the ditch beyond. I hope to flood it.”\nCosca raised an eyebrow. “Good. Flood it. The Gurkish don’t like the\nwater much. Poor sailors. Flood it. Very good.” He tipped his head back and\nsucked the last drops from the bottle, then he tossed it on the dirty floor,\nwiped his mouth with his dirty hand, then wiped his hand on the front of his\nsweat-stained shirt. “At least someone knows what they’re doing. Perhaps\nwhen the Gurkish attack, we’ll last longer than a few days, eh?” Providing\nwe aren’t betrayed beforehand.\n“You never know, perhaps the Gurkish won’t attack.”\n“Oh, I hope they do.” Cosca reached under his chair and produced\nanother bottle. There was a glint in his eye as he pulled the cork out with his\nteeth and spat it across the room. “I get paid double once the fighting\nstarts.”\nI\nt was evening, and a merciful breeze was washing through the audience\nchamber. Glokta leaned against the wall by the window, watching the\nshadows stretch out over the city below.\nThe Lord Governor was keeping him waiting. Trying to let me know he’s\nstill in charge, whatever the Closed Council might say. But Glokta didn’t\nmind being still for a while. The day had been a tiring one. Slogging round\nthe city in the baking heat, examining the walls, the gates, the troops.\nAsking questions. Questions to which no one has satisfactory answers. His\nleg was throbbing, his back was aching, his hand was raw from gripping his\ncane. But no worse than usual. I am still standing. A good day, all in all.\nThe glowing sun was shrouded in lines of orange cloud. Beneath it a\nlong wedge of sea glittered silver in the last light of the day. The land walls\nhad already plunged half the ramshackle buildings of the Lower City into\ndeep gloom, and the shadows of the tall spires of the great temple stretched\nout across the roofs of the Upper City, creeping up the slopes of the rock\ntowards the Citadel. The hills on the mainland were nothing more than a\ndistant suggestion, full of shadows. And crawling with Gurkish soldiers.\nWatching us, as we watch them, no doubt.

How long will they be content to watch, I\nwonder? How long before the sun goes down for us?\nThe door opened and Glokta turned his head, wincing as his neck\nclicked. It was the Lord Governor’s son, Korsten dan Vurms. He shut the\ndoor behind him and strode purposefully into the room, metal heel tips\nclicking on the mosaic floor. Ah, the flower of the Union’s young nobility.\nThe sense of honour is almost palpable. Or did someone fart?\n“Superior Glokta! I hope I have not kept you waiting.”\n“You have,” said Glokta as he shuffled to the table. “That is what\nhappens when one comes late to a meeting.”\nVurms frowned slightly. “Then I apologise,” he said, in the most\nunapologetic tone imaginable. “How are you finding our city?”\n“Hot and full of steps.” Glokta dumped himself into one of the exquisite\nchairs. “Where is the Lord Governor?”\nThe frown turned down further. “I am afraid that my father is unwell,\nand cannot attend. You understand that he is an old man, and needs his rest.\nI can speak for him however.”\n“Can you indeed? And what do the two of you have to say?”\n“My father is most concerned about the work that you are undertaking\non the defences. I am told that the King’s soldiers have been set to digging\nholes on the peninsula, rather than defending the walls of the Upper City.\nYou realise that you are leaving us at the mercy of the natives!”\nGlokta snorted. “The natives are citizens of the Union, no matter how\nreluctant. Believe me, they are more inclined to mercy than the Gurkish.”\nOf their mercy I have firsthand experience.\n“They are primitives!” sneered Vurms, “And dangerous to boot! You\nhave not been here long enough to understand the threat they pose to us!\nYou should talk to Harker. He’s got the right ideas as far as the natives are\nconcerned.”\n“I talked to Harker, and I didn’t like his ideas. I suspect he may have\nbeen forced to rethink them, in fact, downstairs, in the dark.” I suspect he is\nrethinking even now, and as quickly as his pea of a brain will allow. “As for\nyour father’s worries, he need no longer concern himself with the defence\nof the city. Since he is an old man, and in need of rest, I have no doubt he\nwill be happy to pass the responsibility to me.”\nA spasm of anger passed across Vurms’ handsome features. He opened\nhis mouth to hiss some curse, but evidently thought better of it. As well he\nshould. He sat back in his chair, rubbing one thumb and one finger\nthoughtfully together. When he spoke, it was with a friendly smile and a\ncharming softness. Now comes the wheedling. “Superior Glokta, I feel we\nhave got off on the wrong foot—”\n“I only have one that works.”\nVurms’ smile slipped somewhat, but he forged on. “It is plain that you"

I can be a significant hindrance to you, if I have the mind. A\nsignificant hindrance or a great help—”\n“I am so glad that you have chosen to cooperate. You can begin by\ntelling me what became of Superior Davoust.”\nThe smile slipped off entirely. “How should I know?”\n“Everyone knows something.” And someone knows more than the rest.\nIs it you, Vurms?\nThe Lord Governor’s son thought about it for a moment. Dense, or\nguilty? Is he trying to think of ways to help me, or ways to cover his tracks?\n“I know the natives hated him. They were forever plotting against us, and\nDavoust was tireless in his pursuit of the disloyal. I have no doubt he fell\nvictim to one of their schemes. I’d be asking questions down in the Lower\nCity, if I was you.”\n“Oh, I am quite confident the answers lie here in the Citadel.”\n“Not with me,” snapped Vurms, looking Glokta up and down. “Believe\nme when I say, I would be much happier if Davoust was still with us.”\nPerhaps, or perhaps not, but we will get no answers today. “Very well.\nTell me about the city’s stores.”\n“The stores?”\n“Food, Korsten, food. I understand that, since the Gurkish closed the\nland routes, everything must be brought in by sea. Feeding the people is\nsurely one of a governor’s most pressing concerns.”\n“My father is mindful of his people’s needs in any eventuality!” snapped\nVurms. “We have provisions for six months!”\n“Six months? For all the inhabitants?”\n“Of course.” Better than I expected. One less thing to worry about, at\nleast, from this vast tangle of worries. “Unless you count the natives,”\nadded Vurms, as though it was of no importance.\nGlokta paused. “And what will they eat, if the Gurkish lay siege to the\ncity?”\nVurms shrugged. “I really hadn’t thought about it.”\n“Indeed? What will happen, do you suppose, when they begin to\nstarve?”\n“Well…”\n“Chaos is what will happen! We cannot hold the city with four-fifths of\nthe population against us!” Glokta sucked at his empty gums in disgust.\n“You will go to the merchants, you will secure provisions for six months!\nFor everyone! I want six months’ supplies for the rats in the sewers!”\n“What am I?” sneered Vurms. “Your grocery boy?”\n“I suppose you’re whatever I tell you to be.”\nAll trace of friendliness had vanished from Vurms’ face now. “I am the\nson of a Lord Governor! I refuse to be addressed in this manner!” The legs\nof his chair squealed furiously as he sprang up and made for the door.\n“Fine,” murmured Glokta. “There’s a boat that goes to Adua every day.\nA fast boat, and it takes its cargo straight to the House of Questions.

His most revolting, leering, gap-toothed smile. “You’d\nhave to be a bold man to bet your life on what I’d dare. How bold are you?”\nThe young man licked his lips, but he did not meet Glokta’s gaze for long. I\nthought not. He reminds me of my friend Captain Luthar. All flash and\narrogance, but with no kind of character to hang it on. Prick him with a pin,\nand he sags like a punctured wineskin.\n“Six months’ food. Six months for everyone. And see that it’s done\npromptly.” Grocery boy.\n“Of course,” growled Vurms, still staring grimly at the floor.\n“Then we can get started on the water. The wells, the cisterns, the\npumps.

Trying to look like he had no killing in him, no mad fury, no devil.\nShe knew better. He nodded to her and she scowled back. He was a devil\nwearing a cow’s skin, and she was not fooled.\nBetter than that damn Navigator, though. Always talking, always\nsmiling, always laughing. Ferro hated talk, and smiles, and laughter, each\none more than the last. Stupid little man with his stupid tales. Underneath\nall his lies he was plotting, watching, she could feel it.\nThat left the First of the Magi, and she trusted him least of all. She saw\nhis eyes sliding to the cart. Looking at the sack he’d put the box in. Square,\ngrey, dull, heavy box. He thought no one had seen, but she had. Full of\nsecrets is what he was. Bald bastard, with his thick neck and his wooden\npole, acting as if he had done nothing but good in his life, as if he would not\nknow where to begin at making a man explode.\n“Damn fucking pinks,” she whispered to herself. She leaned over and\nspat onto the track, glowered at their five backs as they rode ahead of her.\nWhy had she let Yulwei talk her into this madness? A voyage way off into\nthe cold west where she had no business. She should have been back in the\nSouth, fighting the Gurkish.\nMaking them pay what they owed her.\nCursing the name of Yulwei silently to herself, she followed the others\nup to the bridge. It looked ancient—pitted stones splattered with stains of\nlichen, the surface of it rutted deep where a cart’s wheels would roll.\nThousands of years of carts, rolling back and forward. The stream gurgled\nunder its single arch, bitter-cold water, flowing fast. A low hut stood beside\nthe bridge, settled and slumped into the landscape over long years. Some\nwisps of smoke were snatched from its chimney and out across the land in\nthe cutting wind.\nOne soldier stood outside, alone. Drew the short straw, maybe. He’d\npressed himself against the wall, swathed in a heavy cloak, horse-hair on\nhis helmet whipping back and forth in the gusts, his spear ignored beside\nhim. Bayaz reined his horse in before the bridge and nodded across.\n“We’re going up onto the plain. Out towards Darmium.”\n“Can’t advise it. Dangerous up there.”\nBayaz smiled. “Dangers mean profits.”\n“Profits won’t stop an arrow, friend.” The soldier looked them up and\ndown, one by one, and sniffed. “Varied crowd, aren’t you?”\n“I take good fighters wherever I can find them.”\n“Course.” He looked over at Ferro and she scowled back. “Very tough,\nI’m sure, but the fact is the plains are deadly, and more than ever now.\nSome traders are still going up there, but they’re not coming back.

The others\nfollowed behind, Longfoot first, then Luthar, then Ninefingers. Quai shook\nthe reins and the cart clattered across. Ferro brought up the rear.\n“No help at all!” the soldier called after her, before he wedged himself\nback against the rough wall of his hut.\nT\nhe great plain.\nIt should have been good land for riding, reassuring land. Ferro could\nhave seen an enemy coming from miles away, but she saw no one. Only the\nvast carpet of tall grass, waving and thrashing in the wind, stretching away\nin every direction, to the far, far horizon. Only the track broke the\nmonotony, a line of shorter, drier grass, pocked with patches of bare black\nearth, cutting across the plain straight as an arrow flies.\nFerro did not like it, this vast sameness. She frowned as they rode,\npeering left and right. In the Badlands of Kanta, the barren earth was full of\nfeatures—broken boulders, withered valleys, dried-up trees casting their\nclawing shadows, distant creases in the earth full of shade, bright ridges\ndoused in light. In the Badlands of Kanta, the sky above would be empty,\nstill, a bright bowl holding nothing but the blinding sun in the day, the\nbright stars at night.\nHere all was strangely reversed.\nThe earth was featureless, but the sky was full of movement, full of\nchaos. Towering clouds loomed over the plain, dark and light swirling\ntogether into colossal spirals, sweeping over the grassland with the raking\nwind, shifting, turning, ripping apart and flooding back together, casting\nmonstrous, flowing shadows onto the cowering earth, threatening to crush\nthe six tiny riders and their tiny cart with a deluge to sink the world. All\nhanging over Ferro’s hunched-up shoulders, the wrath of God made real.\nThis was a strange land, one in which she had no place. She needed\nreasons to be here, and good ones. “You, Bayaz!” she shouted, drawing up\nlevel with him. “Where are we going?”\n“Huh,” he grunted, frowning out across the waving grass, from nothing,\nto nothing. “We are going westwards, across the plain, over the great River\nAos, as far as the Broken Mountains.”\n“Then?”\nShe saw the faint lines around his eyes, across the bridge of his nose,\ngrow deeper, watched his lips press together. Annoyance. He did not like\nher questions. “Then we go further.”\n“How long will it take?”\n“All of winter and into spring,” he snapped. “And then we must come"

Not by this shifty old pink. She dug in\nher own heels and drew up level with him. “What is the First Law?”\nBayaz looked sharply over at her. “What do you know about it?”\n“Not enough. I heard you and Yulwei talking, through the door.”\n“Eavesdropping, eh?”\n“You have loud voices and I have good ears.” Ferro shrugged. “I am not\nsticking a bucket on my head just to keep your secrets. What is the First\nLaw?”\nThe lines round Bayaz’s forehead grew deeper, the corners of his mouth\nturned down. Anger. “A stricture that Euz placed on his sons, the first rule\nmade after the chaos of ancient days. It is forbidden to touch the Other Side\ndirect. Forbidden to communicate with the world below, forbidden to\nsummon demons, forbidden to open gates to hell. Such is the First Law, the\nguiding principle of all magic.”\n“Uh,” snorted Ferro. It meant nothing to her. “Who is Khalul?”\nBayaz’s thick brows drew in together, his frown deepened, his eyes\nnarrowed. “Is there no end to your questions, woman?” Her questions\ngalled him. That was good. That meant they were the right questions.\n“You’ll know if I stop asking them. Who is Khalul?”\n“Khalul was one of the order of Magi,” growled Bayaz. “One of my\norder. The second of Juvens’ twelve apprentices. He was always jealous of\nmy place, always thirsty for power. He broke the Second Law to get it. He\nate the flesh of men, and persuaded others to do the same. He made of\nhimself a false prophet, tricked the Gurkish into serving him. That is\nKhalul. Your enemy, and mine.”\n“What is the Seed?”\nThe Magus’s face gave a sudden twitch. Fury, and perhaps the slightest\ntrace of fear. Then his face softened. “What is it?” He smiled at her, and his\nsmile worried her more than all his anger could have. He leaned towards\nher, close enough that no one else could hear. “It is the instrument of your\nvengeance. Of our vengeance. But it is dangerous. Even to speak of it is\ndangerous. There are those who are always listening. It would be wise for\nyou to shut the door on your questions, before the answers to them burn us\nall.” He spurred his horse once again, trotting out ahead of the party on his\nown.\nFerro stayed behind. She had learned enough for now. Learned enough\nto trust this First of the Magi less than ever.\nA\nhollow in the ground, no more than four strides across. A sink in the soil,\nringed by a low wall of damp, dark earth, full of tangled grass roots. That\nwas the best place they had found to camp for the night, and they had been\nlucky to find it.\nIt was as big a feature in the landscape as Ferro had seen all day."

        "text": "was the best place they had found to camp for the night, and they had been\nlucky to find it.\nIt was as big a feature in the landscape as Ferro had seen all day.\nThe fire that Longfoot had made was burning well now, flames licking\nbright and hungry at the wood, rustling and flickering out sideways as a\ngust of wind swept down into the hollow. The five pinks sat clustered\naround it, hunched and huddled for warmth, light from it bright on their\npinched-up faces.\nLongfoot was the only one speaking. His talk was all of his own great\nachievements. How he had been to this place or that. How he knew this\nthing or that. How he had a remarkable talent for this, or for that. Ferro was\nsick of it already, and had told him so twice. The first time she thought she\nhad been clear. The second time she had made sure of it. He would not be\ntalking to her of his idiot travels again, but the others still suffered in\nsilence.\nThere was space for her, down by the fire, but she did not want it. She\npreferred to sit above them, cross-legged in the grass on the lip of the\nhollow. It was cold up here in the wind, and she pulled the blanket tighter\nround her shivering shoulders. A strange and frightening thing, cold. She\nhated it.\nBut she preferred cold to company.\nAnd so she sat apart, sullen and silent, and watched the light drain out of\nthe brooding sky, watched the darkness creep into the land. There was just\nthe faintest glow of the sun now, on the distant horizon. A last feeble\nbrightness round the edges of the looming clouds.\nThe big pink stood up, and looked at her. “Getting dark,” he said.\n“Uh.”\n“Guess that’s what happens when the sun goes down, eh?”\n“Uh.”\nHe scratched at the side of his thick neck. “We need to set watches.\nCould be dangerous out here at night. We’ll take it in shifts. I’ll go first,\nthen Luthar—”\n“I’ll watch,” she grunted.\n“Don’t worry. You can sleep. I’ll wake you later.”\n“I do not sleep.”\nHe stared at her. “What, never?”\n“Not often.”\n“Maybe that explains her mood,” murmured Longfoot.\nMeant to be under his breath, no doubt, but Ferro heard him. “My mood\nis my business, fool.”\nThe Navigator said nothing as he wrapped himself in his blanket and\nstretched out beside the fire.\n“You want to go first,” said Ninefingers, “then do it, but wake me a\ncouple of hours in. We each should take our turn.”\nS\nlowly, quietly, wincing with the need not to make noise, Ferro stole from\nthe cart. Dry meat. Dry bread. Water flask. Enough to keep her going for\ndays. She shoved it into a canvas bag.\nOne of the horses snorted and shied as she slipped past and she scowled\nat it. She could ride. She could ride well, but she wanted nothing to do with\nhorses. Damn fool, big beasts. Smelled bad. They might move quick, but\nthey needed too much food and water. You could see and hear them from"

They left great big tracks to follow. Riding a horse made you\nweak. Rely on a horse and when you need to run, you find you can’t\nanymore.\nFerro had learned never to rely on anything except herself.\nShe slipped the bag over one shoulder, her quiver and her bow over the\nother. She took one last look at the sleeping shapes of the others, dark\nmounds clustered round the fire. Luthar had the blanket drawn up under his\nchin, smooth-skinned, full-lipped face turned towards the glowing embers.\nBayaz had his back to her, but she could see the dim light shining off his\nbald pate, the back of one dark ear, hear the slow rhythm of his breathing.\nLongfoot had his blanket pulled up over his head, but his bare feet stuck\nfrom the other end, thin and bony, tendons standing out like tree roots from\nthe mud. Quai’s eyes were open the tiniest chink, firelight shining wet on a\nslit of eyeball. Made it look like he was watching her, but his chest was\nmoving slowly up and down, mouth hanging slack, sound asleep and\ndreaming, no doubt.\nFerro frowned. Just four? Where was the big pink? She saw his blanket\nlying empty on the far side of the fire, dark folds and light folds, but no man\ninside. Then she heard his voice.\n“Going already?”\nBehind her. That was a surprise, that he could have crept around her like\nthat, while she was stealing food. He seemed too big, too slow, too noisy to\ncreep up on anyone. She cursed under her breath. She should have known\nbetter than to go by the way things seemed.\nShe turned slowly round to face him and took one step towards the\nhorses. He followed, keeping the distance between them the same. Ferro\ncould see the glowing fire reflected in one corner of each of his eyes, a\ncurve of cratered, stubbly cheek, the vague outline of his bent nose, a few\nstrands of greasy hair floating over his head in the breeze, slightly blacker\nthan the black land behind.\n“I don’t want to fight you, pink. I’ve seen you fight.” She had seen him\nkill five men in a few moments, and even she had been surprised. The\nmemory of the laughter echoing from the walls, his twisted hungry face,\nhalf snarl, half smile, covered in blood, and spit, and madness, the ruined\ncorpses strewn on the stones like rags, all this was sharp in her mind. Not\nthat she was frightened, of course, for Ferro Maljinn felt no fear.\nBut she knew when to be careful.\n“I’ve no wish to fight you either,” he said, “but if Bayaz finds you gone\nin the morning, he’ll have me chasing you. I’ve seen you run, and I’d rather\nfight you than chase you. At least I’d have some chance.”\nHe was stronger than her, and she knew it. Almost healed now, moving\nfreely. She regretted helping him with that. Helping people was always a\nmistake. A fight was an awful risk. She might be tougher than others, but"

She might be tougher than others, but\nshe’d no wish to have her face broken into slop like that big man, the Stone-\nSplitter. No wish to be stuck through with a sword, to have her knees\nsmashed, her head ripped half off.\nNone of that held any appeal.\nBut he was too close to shoot, and if she ran he’d rouse the others, and\nthey had horses. Fighting would probably wake them anyway, but if she\ncould land a good blow quickly, she might get away in the confusion.\nHardly perfect, but what choice did she have? She slowly swung the bag off\nher shoulder and lowered it to the ground, then her bow and her quiver. She\nput one hand onto the hilt of her sword, fingers brushing the grip in the\ndarkness, and he did the same.\n“Alright then, pink. Let’s get to it.”\n“Might be there’s another way.”\nShe watched him, suspicious, ready for tricks. “What way?”\n“Stay with us. Give it a few days. If you don’t change your mind, well,\nI’ll help you pack. You can trust me.” Trust was a word for fools. It was a\nword people used when they meant to betray you. If he moved forward a\nfinger’s width, she would sweep the sword out and take his head off. She\nwas ready.\nBut he did not move forward and he did not move back. He stood there,\na big, silent outline in the darkness. She frowned, fingertips still tickling the\ngrip of the curved sword. “Why should I trust you?”\nThe big pink shrugged his heavy shoulders. “Why not? Back in the city,\nI helped you and you helped me. Without each other, might be we’d both be\ndead.” It was true, she supposed, he had helped her. Not as much as she had\nhelped him, but still. “Time comes you got to stick at something, don’t you?\nThat’s the thing about trust, sooner or later you just got to do it, without\ngood reasons.”\n“Why?”\n“Otherwise you end up like us, and who wants that?”\n“Huh.”\n“I’ll do you a deal. You watch my back, I’ll watch yours.” He tapped his\nchest slowly with his thumb. “I’ll stick.” He pointed at her. “You’ll stick.\nWhat d’you say?”\nFerro thought about it. Running had given her freedom, but little else. It\nhad taken her through years of misery to the very edge of the desert,\nhemmed in by enemies. She had run from Yulwei, and the Eaters had nearly\ntaken her. Where would she run to now, anyway? Would she run across the\nsea to Kanta? Perhaps the big pink was right. Perhaps the time had come to\nstop running.\nAt least until she could get away unnoticed.\nShe took her hand away from her sword, slowly folded her arms across\nher chest, and he did the same. They stood there for a long moment,\nwatching one another in the darkness, in the silence. “Alright, pink,” she\ngrowled. “I will stick, as you say, and we will see. But I make no fucking\npromises, you understand?”"

You get some rest.”\n“I need no rest, I told you that.”\n“Suit yourself, but I’m sitting down.”\n“Fine.”\nThe big pink began to lower himself cautiously towards the earth, and\nshe followed him. They sat cross-legged where they had stood, facing each\nother, the embers of the campfire glowing beside them, casting a faint\nbrightness over the four sleepers, across one side of the pink’s lumpy face,\ncasting a faint warmth across hers.\nThey watched each other.\nAllies\nTo Arch Lector Sult, head of His Majesty’s Inquisition.\nYour Eminence,\nWork is underway on the defences of the city. The famous land walls,\nthough powerful, are in a shameful condition, and I have taken\nvigorous steps to strengthen them. I have also ordered extra supplies,\nfood, armour, and weapons, essential if the city is to stand a siege of\nany duration.\nUnfortunately, the defences are extensive, and the scale of the\ntask vast. I have begun the work on credit, but credit will only stretch\nso far. I most humbly entreat that Your Eminence will send me funds\nwith which to work. Without money our efforts must cease, and the\ncity will be lost.\nThe Union forces here are few, and morale is not high. There are\nmercenaries within the city, and I have ordered that more be\nrecruited, but their loyalty is questionable, particularly if they cannot\nbe paid. I therefore request that more of the King’s soldiers might be\nsent. Even a single company could make a difference.\nYou will hear from me soon. Until then, I serve and obey.\nSand dan Glokta,\nSuperior of Dagoska.\nT\nhis is the place,” said Glokta. “Uh,” said Frost. It was a rough building of\none storey, carelessly built from mud bricks, no bigger than a good-sized\nwood shed. Chinks of light spilled out into the night from around the ill-\nfitting door and the ill-fitting shutters in the single window. It was much the\nsame as the other huts in the street, if you could call it a street. It hardly\nlooked like the residence of a member of Dagoska’s ruling council. But then\nKahdia is the odd man out in many ways. The leader of the natives. The\npriest without a temple. The one with least to lose, perhaps?\nThe door opened before Glokta even had the chance to knock. Kahdia\nstood in the doorway, tall and slender in his white robe. “Why don’t you\ncome in?” The Haddish turned, stepped over to the only chair, and sat down\nin it.\n“Wait here,” said Glokta.\n“Uh.”\nThe inside of the shed was no more auspicious than the outside. Clean,\nand orderly, and poor as hell. The ceiling was so low that Glokta could\nonly just stand upright, the floor was hard-packed dirt.

A\nsquat cupboard stood under the window, a few books stacked on top, a\nguttering candle burning beside them. Apart from a dented bucket for\nnatural functions, that appeared to be the full extent of Kahdia’s worldly\npossessions. No sign of any hidden corpses of Superiors of the Inquisition,\nbut you never know. A body can be packed away quite neatly, if one cuts it\ninto small enough pieces…\n“You should move out of the slums.” Glokta shut the door behind him\non creaking hinges, limped to the bed, and sat down heavily on the\nmattress.\n“Natives are not permitted within the Upper City, or had you not heard?”\n“I’m sure that an exception could be made in your case. You could have\nchambers in the Citadel. Then I wouldn’t have to limp all the way down\nhere to speak to you.”\n“Chambers in the Citadel? While my fellows rot down here in the filth?\nThe least a leader can do is to share the burdens of his people. I have little\nother comfort to give them.” It was sweltering hot down here in the Lower\nCity, but Kahdia did not seem uncomfortable. His gaze was level, his eyes\nwere fixed on Glokta’s, dark and cool as deep water. “Do you disapprove?”\nGlokta rubbed at his aching neck. “Not in the least. Martyrdom suits\nyou, but you’ll have to forgive me if I don’t join in.” He licked at his empty\ngums. “I’ve made my sacrifices.”\n“Perhaps not all of them. Ask your questions.” Straight to business, then.\nNothing to hide? Or nothing to lose?\n“Do you know what became of my predecessor, Superior Davoust?”\n“It is my earnest hope that he died in great pain.” Glokta felt his\neyebrows lift. The very last thing I expected—an honest answer. Perhaps\nthe first honest answer that I have received to that question, but hardly one\nthat frees him from suspicion.\n“In great pain, you say?”\n“Very great pain. And I will shed no tears if you join him.”\nGlokta smiled. “I don’t know that I can think of anyone who will, but\nDavoust is the matter in hand. Were your people involved in his\ndisappearance?”\n“It is possible. Davoust gave us reasons enough. There are many\nfamilies missing husbands, fathers, daughters, because of his purges, his\ntests of loyalty, his making of examples. My people number many\nthousands, and I cannot watch them all. The one thing I can tell you is that I\nknow nothing of his disappearance. When one devil falls they always send\nanother, and here you are. My people have gained nothing.”\n“Except Davoust’s silence. Perhaps he discovered that you had made a\ndeal with the Gurkish. Perhaps joining the Union was not all your people\nhoped for.”\nKahdia snorted. “You know nothing. No Dagoskan would ever strike a\ndeal with the Gurkish.”\n“To an outsider, the two of you seem to have much in common.”\n“To an ignorant outsider, we do. We both have dark skin, and we both"

We both have dark skin, and we both\npray to God, but that is the full extent of the similarity. We Dagoskans have\nnever been a warlike people. We remained here on our peninsula, confident\nin the strength of our defences, while the Gurkish Empire spread like a\ncancer across the Kantic continent. We thought their conquests were none\nof our concern. That was our folly. Emissaries came to our gates,\ndemanding that we kneel before the Gurkish Emperor, and acknowledge\nthat the prophet Khalul speaks with the voice of God. We would do neither,\nand Khalul swore to destroy us. Now, it seems, he will finally succeed. All\nof the South will be his dominion.” And the Arch Lector will not be in the\nleast amused.\n“Who knows? Perhaps God will come to your aid.”\n“God favours those who solve their own problems.”\n“Perhaps we can solve some problems between us.”\n“I have no interest in helping you.”\n“Even if you help yourself as well? I have it in mind to issue a decree.\nThe gates of the Upper City will be opened, your people will be allowed to\ncome and go in their own city as they please. The Spicers will be turned out\nof the Great Temple, and it shall once again be your sacred ground. The\nDagoskans will be permitted to carry arms; indeed, we will provide you\nwith weapons from our own armouries. The natives will be treated like full\ncitizens of the Union. They deserve nothing less.”\n“So. So.” Kahdia clasped his hands together and sat back in his creaking\nchair. “Now, with the Gurkish knocking at the gates, you come to Dagoska,\nflaunting your little scroll as though it was the word of God, and you choose\nto do the right thing. You are not like all the others. You are a good man, a\nfair man, a just man. You expect me to believe this?”\n“Honestly? I don’t care a shit what you believe, and I care about doing\nthe right thing even less—that’s all a matter of who you ask. As for being a\ngood man”—and Glokta curled his lip—“that ship sailed long ago, and I\nwasn’t even there to wave it off. I’m interested in holding Dagoska. That\nand nothing else.”\n“And you know you cannot hold Dagoska without our help.”\n“Neither one of us is a fool, Kahdia. Don’t insult me by acting like one.\nWe can bicker with each other until the Gurkish tide sweeps over the land\nwalls, or we can cooperate. You never know, together we might even beat\nthem. Your people will help us dig the ditch, repair the walls, hang the\ngates. You will provide a thousand men to serve in the defence of the city,\nto begin with, and more later.”\n“Will I? Will I indeed? And if, with our help, the city stands? Will our\ndeal stand with it?”\nIf the city stands, I will be gone.

You could sulk down here in the slums with the flies\nfor company, and wait for the Emperor to come. Perhaps the great Uthman-\nul-Dosht will offer you a better deal.” Glokta looked Kahdia in the eye for a\nmoment. “But we both know he won’t.”\nThe priest pursed his lips, stroked his beard, then gave a deep sigh.\n“They say a man lost in the desert must take such water as he is offered, no\nmatter who it comes from. I accept your deal. Once the temple is empty we\nwill dig your holes, and carry your stone, and wear your swords. Something\nis better than nothing, and as you say, perhaps together we can even beat the\nGurkish.

The same chambers that were once occupied\nby my illustrious predecessor, Superior Davoust. They were a wide, airy,\nwell-furnished set of rooms. Perhaps they once belonged to a Dagoskan\nPrince, or a scheming vizier, or a dusky concubine, before the natives were\nthrown out into the dust of the Lower City. Better by far than my poky shit-\nhole in the Agriont, except that Superiors of the Inquisition have been\nknown to go missing from these rooms.\nOne set of windows faced northwards, out towards the sea, on the\nsteepest side of the rock, the other looked over the baking city. Both were\nequipped with heavy shutters. Outside, it was a sheer drop over bare stone\nto jagged rocks and angry salt water. The door was six fingers thick,\nstudded with iron, fitted with a heavy lock and four great bolts. Davoust\nwas a cautious man, and with good reason, it would seem. So how could\nassassins have got in, and having got in, how could they remove the body?\nHe felt his mouth curving into a smile. How will they remove mine,\nwhen they come? Already my enemies mount up—the sneering Vurms, the\npunctilious Vissbruck, the merchants whose profits I threaten, the Practicals\nwho served Harker and Davoust, the natives with good reason to hate\nanyone who wears black, my old enemies the Gurkish, of course, and all\nthat providing His Eminence does not get anxious at the lack of progress,\nand decide to have me replaced himself.

Some wounds take time to heal, and others never do.

Knowledge is so often the antidote to fear. But not\nhere. Not now. “I know nothing!”\n“I will be the judge of what you know.” Glokta wiped some sweat from\nhis face. The room was hot as a busy forge and the glowing coals in the\nbrazier were far from helping. “If a thing smells like a liar, and is the colour\nof a liar, the chances are it is a liar, would you not agree?”\n“Please! We are all on the same side!” Are we? Are we really? “I have\ntold you only the truth!”\n“Perhaps, but not as much of it as I need.”\n“Please! We are all friends here!”\n“Friends? In my experience, a friend is merely an acquaintance who has\nyet to betray you. Is that what you are, Harker?”\n“No!”\nGlokta frowned. “Then you are our enemy?”\n“What? No!

Saucy, but hardly relevant. He worked his hand around the pincers.\n“It is the Superior himself, not his money, that interests me. Believe me\nwhen I say that I grow tired of asking the question. What became of\nDavoust?”\n“I… I… I don’t know!”\nTrue, perhaps. But hardly the answer I need. “Not good enough.” Glokta\nsqueezed his hand and the metal jaws bit cleanly through flesh and met in\nthe middle with a gentle click. Harker bellowed, and thrashed, and roared in\nagony, blood bubbling from the red square of flesh where his nipple used to\nbe and running down his pale belly in dark streaks. Glokta winced at a\ntwinge in his neck and stretched his head out until he heard it click. Strange\nhow, with time, even the most terrible suffering of others can become…\ntedious.\n“Practical Frost, the Inquisitor is bleeding! If you please!”\n“I’th thorry.” The iron scraped as Frost dragged it from the brazier,\nglowing orange. Glokta could feel the heat of it even from where he was\nsitting. Ah, hot iron. It keeps no secrets, it tells no lies.\n“No! No! I—” Harker’s words dissolved into a bubbling scream as Frost\nground the brand into the wound and the room filled slowly with the salty\naroma of cooking meat. A smell which, to Glokta’s disgust, caused his\nempty stomach to rumble. How long is it since I had a good slice of meat?\nHe wiped a fresh sheen of sweat from his face with his free hand and\nworked his aching shoulders under his coat.\nAn ugly business, that we find ourselves in. So why do I do this? The\nonly answer was the soft crunch as Frost slid the iron carefully back into the\ncoals, sending up a dusting of orange sparks. Harker twisted, and\nwhimpered, and shook, his weeping eyes bulging, a strand of smoke still\ncurling up from the blackened flesh on his chest. An ugly business, of\ncourse. No doubt he deserves it, but that changes nothing. Probably he has\nno clue what became of Davoust, but that changes nothing either. The\nquestions must be asked, and exactly as if he did know the answers.\n“Why do you insist on defying me, Harker? Could it be… that you\nsuppose… that once I’m done with your nipples I’ll have run out of ideas?\nIs that what you’re thinking? That your nipples are where I’ll stop?”\nHarker stared at him, bubbles of spit forming and breaking on his lips.\nGlokta leaned closer. “Oh, no, no, no. This is only the beginning. This is\nbefore the beginning. Time opens up ahead of us in pitiless abundance.\nDays, and weeks, and months of it, if need be. Do you seriously believe that\nyou can keep your secrets for that long? You belong to me, now. To me, and\nto this room. This cannot stop until I know what I need to know.” He\nreached forward and gripped Harker’s other nipple between thumb and"

He took up the pincers and opened their bloody jaws. “How\ndifficult can that be to understand?”\nM\nagister Eider’s dining chamber was fabulous to behold. Cloths of silver\nand crimson, gold and purple, green and blue and vivid yellow, rippled in\nthe gentle breeze from the narrow windows. Screens of filigree marble\nadorned the walls, great pots as high as a man stood in the corners. Heaps of\npristine cushions were tossed about the floor, as though inviting passersby\nto sprawl in comfortable decadence. Coloured candles burned in tall glass\njars, casting warm light into every corner, filling the air with sweet scent. At\none end of the marble hall clear water trickled gently in a star-shaped pool.\nThere was more than a touch of the theatrical about the place. Like a\nQueen’s boudoir from some Kantic legend.\nMagister Eider, head of the Guild of Spicers, was herself the\ncentrepiece. The very Queen of merchants. She sat at the top of the table in\na pristine white gown, shimmering silk with just the slightest, fascinating\nhint of transparency. A small fortune in jewels flashed on every inch of\ntanned skin, her hair was piled up and held in place with ivory combs,\nexcepting a few strands, curling artfully around her face. It looked very\nmuch as if she had been preparing herself all day. And not a moment was\nwasted.\nGlokta, hunched in his chair at the opposite end with a bowl of steaming\nsoup before him, felt as if he had shuffled into the pages of a storybook. A\nlurid romance, set in the exotic South, with Magister Eider as the heroine,\nand myself the disgusting, the crippled, the black-hearted villain. How will\nthis fable end, I wonder? “So, tell me, Magister, to what do I owe this\nhonour?”\n“I understand that you have spoken to the other members of the council.\nI was surprised, and just a little hurt, that you had not sought an audience\nwith me already.”\n“I apologise if you felt left out. It seemed only fitting that I saved the\nmost powerful until last.”\nShe looked up with an air of injured innocence. And a most\nconsummately acted one. “Powerful? Me? Vurms controls the budget,\nissues the decrees, Vissbruck commands the troops, holds the defences.\nKahdia speaks for the great majority of the populace. I scarcely figure.”\n“Come now.” Glokta grinned his toothless grin. “You are radiant, of\ncourse, but I am not quite blinded. Vurms’ budget is a pittance compared to\nwhat the Spicers make. Kahdia’s people have been rendered almost\nhelpless. Through your pickled friend Cosca you command more than twice\nthe troops that Vissbruck does. The only reason the Union is even interested\nin this thirsty rock is for the trade that your guild controls.”\n“Well, I don’t like to boast.” The Magister gave an artless shrug. “But I\nsuppose that I do have some passing influence in the city. You have been\nasking questions, I see.”"

You have been\nasking questions, I see.”\n“That’s what I do.” Glokta raised his spoon to his mouth, trying his best\nnot to slurp between his remaining teeth. “This soup is delicious, by the\nway.” And, one hopes, not fatal.\n“I thought you might appreciate it. You see, I have been asking questions\nalso.”\nThe water plopped and tinkled in the pool, the fabric rustled on the\nwalls, the silverware clicked gently against the fine pottery of their bowls. I\nwould call that first round a draw. Carlot dan Eider was the first to break\nthe silence.\n“I realise, of course, that you have a mission from the Arch Lector\nhimself. A mission of the greatest importance. I see that you are not a man\nto mince your words, but you might want to tread a little more carefully.”\n“I admit my gait is awkward. A war wound, compounded by two years\nof torture. It’s a wonder I got to keep the leg at all.”\nShe smiled wide, displaying two rows of perfect teeth. “I am thoroughly\ntickled, but my colleagues have found you somewhat less entertaining.\nVurms and Vissbruck have both taken a decided dislike to you. ‘High-\nhanded’ was the phrase they used, I believe, among others I had better not\nrepeat.”\nGlokta shrugged. “I am not here to make friends.” And he drained his\nglass of a predictably excellent wine.\n“But friends can be useful. If nothing else, a friend is one less enemy.\nDavoust insisted on upsetting everyone, and the results have not been\nhappy.”\n“Davoust did not enjoy the support of the Closed Council.”\n“True. But no document will stop a knife thrust.”\n“Is that a threat?”\nCarlot dan Eider laughed. It was an easy, open, friendly laugh. It was\nhard to believe that anyone who made such a sound could be a traitor, or a\nthreat, or anything other than a perfectly charming host. And yet I am not\nentirely convinced. “That is advice. Advice born of bitter experience. I\nwould prefer it if you did not disappear quite yet.”\n“Really? I had no idea I was such a winning dinner guest.”\n“You are terse, confrontational, slightly frightening, and impose severe\nrestrictions on the menu, but the fact is you are more use to me here\nthan…”—and she waved her hand—“wherever Davoust went to. Would\nyou care for more wine?”\n“Of course.”\nShe got up from her chair and swept towards him, feet padding on the\ncool marble like a dancer’s. Bare feet, in the Kantic fashion. The breeze\nstirred the flowing garments around her body as she leaned forward to fill\nGlokta’s glass, wafted her rich scent in his face. Just the sort of woman my\nmother would have wanted me to marry—beautiful, clever, and oh so very\nrich. Just the sort of woman I would have wanted to marry, for that matter,\nwhen I was younger.

When I was a different man.\nThe flickering candlelight shone on her hair, flashed on the jewels\naround her long neck, glowed through the wine as it sloshed from the neck\nof the bottle. Does she try and charm me merely because I hold the writ of\nthe Closed Council? Nothing more than good business, to be on good terms\nwith the powerful? Or does she hope to fool me, and distract me, and lure\nme away from the unpleasant truth? Her eyes met his briefly, and she gave a\ntiny, knowing smile and looked back to his glass. Am I to be her little urchin\nboy, dirty face pressed up against the baker’s window, mouth watering for\nthe sweetmeats I know I can never afford? I think not.\n“Where did Davoust go to?”\nMagister Eider paused for a moment, then carefully set down the bottle.\nShe slid into the nearest chair, put her elbows on the table, her chin on her\nhands, and held Glokta’s eye. “I suspect that he was killed by a traitor in the\ncity. Probably an agent of the Gurkish. At the risk of telling you what you\nalready know, Davoust suspected there was a conspiracy afoot within the\ncity’s ruling council. He confided as much to me shortly before his\ndisappearance.”\nDid he indeed? “A conspiracy within the ruling council?” Glokta shook\nhis head in mock horror. “Is such a thing possible?”\n“Let us be honest with each other, Superior. I want what you want. We\nin the Guild of Spicers have invested far too much time and money in this\ncity to see it fall to the Gurkish, and you seem to offer a better chance of\nholding on to it than those idiots Vurms and Vissbruck. If there is a traitor\nwithin our walls, I want him found.”\n“Him… or her.”\nMagister Eider raised one delicate eyebrow. “It cannot have escaped\nyour notice that I am the only woman on the council.”\n“It has not.” Glokta slurped noisily from his spoon. “But forgive me if I\ndon’t discount you quite yet. It will require more than good soup and\npleasant conversation to convince me of anyone’s innocence.” Although it’s\na damn sight more than anyone else has offered me.\nMagister Eider smiled as she raised her glass. “Then how can I convince\nyou?”\n“Honestly? I need money.”\n“Ah, money. It always comes back to that. Getting money out of my\nGuild is like trying to dig up water in the desert—tiring, dirty, and almost\nalways a waste of time.” Somewhat like asking questions of Inquisitor\nHarker. “How much were you thinking of?”\n“We could begin with, say, a hundred thousand marks.”\nEider did not actually choke on her wine. More of a gentle gurgle. She\nset her glass down carefully, quietly cleared her throat, dabbed at her mouth\nwith the corner of a cloth, then looked up at him, eyebrows raised. “You\nvery well know that no such amount will be forthcoming.”\n“I’ll settle for whatever you can give me, for now.”\n“We’ll see. Are your ambitions limited to a mere hundred thousand"

Are your ambitions limited to a mere hundred thousand\nmarks, or is there anything else I can do for you?”\n“Actually there is. I need the merchants out of the Temple.”\nEider rubbed gently at her own temples, as though Glokta’s demands\nwere giving her a headache. “He wants the merchants out,” she murmured.\n“It was necessary to secure Kahdia’s support. With him against us we\ncannot hope to hold the city for long.”\n“I’ve been telling those arrogant fools the same thing for years, but\nstamping on the natives has become quite the popular pastime nonetheless.\nVery well, when do you want them out?”\n“Tomorrow. At the latest.”\n“And they call you high-handed?” She shook her head. “Very well. By\ntomorrow evening I could well be the most unpopular Magister in living\nmemory, if I still have my post at all, but I’ll try and sell it to the Guild.”\nGlokta grinned. “I feel confident that you could sell anything.”\n“You’re a tough negotiator, Superior. If you ever get tired of asking\nquestions, I have no doubt you’ve a bright future as a merchant.”\n“A merchant? Oh, I’m not that ruthless.” Glokta placed his spoon in the\nempty bowl and licked at his gums. “I mean no disrespect, but how does a\nwoman come to head the most powerful Guild in the Union?”\nEider paused, as though wondering whether to answer or not. Or judging\nhow much truth to tell when she does. She looked down at her glass, turned\nthe stem slowly round and round. “My husband was Magister before me.\nWhen we married, I was twenty-two years old, he was near sixty. My father\nowed him a great deal of money, and offered my hand as payment for the\ndebt.” Ah, so we all have our sufferings. Her lip twisted in a faint scowl.\n“My husband always had a good nose for a bargain. His health began to\ndecline soon after we married, and I took a more and more active role in the\nmanagement of his affairs, and those of the Guild. By the time he died I was\nMagister in all but name, and my colleagues were sensible enough to\nformalise the arrangement. The Spicers have always been more concerned\nfor profit than propriety.” Her eyes flicked up to look at Glokta. “I mean no\ndisrespect, but how does a war hero come to be a torturer?”\nIt was his turn to pause. A good question. How did that happen? “There\nare precious few opportunities for cripples.”\nEider nodded slowly, her eyes never leaving Glokta’s face. “That must\nhave been hard. To come back, after all that time in the darkness, and to find\nthat your friends had no use for you. To see in their faces only guilt, and\npity, and disgust. To find yourself alone.”\nGlokta’s eyelid was twitching, and he rubbed at it gently. He had never\ndiscussed such things with anyone before. And now here I am, discussing\nthem with a stranger. “There can be no doubt that I’m a tragic figure. I used\nto be a shit of a man, now I’m a husk of one. Take your pick.”"

Very sick, and very\nangry.” If only you knew. “It still seems a strange decision, though, for the\ntortured to turn torturer.”\n“On the contrary, nothing could be more natural. In my experience,\npeople do as they are done to. You were sold by your father and bought by\nyour husband, and yet you choose to buy and sell.”\nEider frowned. Something for her to think about, perhaps? “I would\nhave thought your pain would give you empathy.”\n“Empathy? What’s that?” Glokta winced as he rubbed at his aching leg.\n“It’s a sad fact, but pain only makes you sorry for yourself.”\nCampfire Politics\nL\nogen shifted uncomfortably in his saddle, and squinted up at the few\nbirds circling around over the great flat plain. Damn but his arse hurt. His\nthighs were sore, his nose was all full of the smell of horse. Couldn’t find a\ncomfortable position to put his fruits in. Always squashed, however often he\njammed his hand down inside his belt to move ’em. A damn uncomfortable\njourney this was turning out to be, in all sorts of ways.\nHe used to talk on the road, back in the North. When he was a boy he’d\ntalked to his father. When he was a young man he’d talked to his friends.\nWhen he’d followed Bethod he’d talked to him, all the day long, for they’d\nbeen close back then, like brothers almost. Talk took your mind off the\nblisters on your feet, or the hunger in your belly, or the endless bloody cold,\nor who’d got killed yesterday.\nLogen used to laugh at the Dogman’s stories while they slogged through\nthe snow. He used to puzzle over tactics with Threetrees while they rode\nthrough the mud. He used to argue with Black Dow while they waded\nthrough bogs, and no subject was ever too small. He’d even traded a joke or\ntwo with Harding Grim in his time, and there weren’t too many who could\nsay that.\nHe sighed to himself. A long, painful sigh that caught at the back of his\nthroat. Good times, no doubt, but far behind him now, in the sunny valleys\nof the past. Those boys were all gone back to the mud. All silent, forever.\nWorse yet, they’d left Logen out in the middle of nowhere with this lot.\nThe great Jezal dan Luthar wasn’t interested in anyone’s stories except\nhis own. He sat stiff upright and aloof the whole time, chin held high,\ndisplaying his arrogance, and his superiority, and his contempt for\neverything like a young man might show off his first sword, long before he\nlearned that it was nothing to be proud of.\nBayaz had no interest in tactics. When he spoke at all he barked in single\nwords, in yeses and in nos, frowning out across the endless grass like a man\nwho’s made a bad mistake and can’t see his way clear of it.

Brother\nLongfoot was away across the plain, scouting out the route. Probably best\nthat way. No one else had any talk at all. The Navigator, Logen had to\nadmit, had far too much.\nFerro rode some distance away from the rest of this friendly gathering,\nher shoulders hunched, her brows drawn down in a constant scowl, the long\nscar on her cheek puckered up an angry grey, doing her best to make the\nothers look like a sack of laughs. She leaned forward, into the wind,\npushing at it, as if she hoped to hurt it with her face. More fun to trade jokes\nwith the plague than with her, Logen reckoned.\nAnd that was the merry band. His shoulders slumped. “How long until\nwe get to the edge of the World?” he asked Bayaz, without much hope.\n“Some way yet,” growled the Magus through barely open teeth.\nSo Logen rode on, tired, and sore, and bored, and watched those few\nbirds gliding slowly over the endless plain. Nice, big, fat birds. He licked\nhis lips. “We could do with some meat,” he muttered. Hadn’t had fresh meat\nin a good long time now. Not since they left Calcis. Logen rubbed his\nstomach. The fatty softness from his time in the city was already tightening.\n“Nice bit of meat.”\nFerro frowned over at him, then up at the few birds circling above. She\nshrugged her bow off her shoulder.\n“Hah!” chuckled Logen. “Good luck.” He watched her slide an arrow\nsmoothly out from her quiver. Futile gesture. Even Harding Grim could\nnever have made that shot, and he was the best man Logen had ever seen\nwith a bow. He watched Ferro nock her shaft to the curved wood, back\narched, yellow eyes fixed on the gliding shapes overhead.\n“You’ll never bag one of those, not in a thousand years of trying.” She\npulled back the string. “Waste of a shaft!” he shouted. “You’ve got to be\nrealistic about these things!” Probably the arrow would drop back down and\nstab him in the face. Or stick his horse through the neck so it died and fell\nover and crushed him under it. A fitting end to this nightmare of a journey.\nA moment later one of the birds tumbled down into the grass, Ferro’s arrow\nstuck right through it.\n“No,” he whispered, gawping open-mouthed at her as she bent the bow\nagain. Another arrow sailed up into the grey sky. Another bird flopped to the\nearth, just beside the first. Logen stared at it, disbelieving. “No!”\n“Don’t tell me you haven’t seen stranger things,” said Bayaz. “A man\nwho talks to spirits, who travels with Magi, the most feared man in all the\nNorth?”\nLogen pulled his horse up and slithered down from the saddle.

If Logen had stabbed it with the arrow at a distance of a foot, he\ncould hardly have done it more neatly. “That’s wrong.”\nBayaz grinned down, hands crossed on the saddle before him. “In\nancient days, before history, so the legends say, our world and the Other\nSide were joined. One world. Demons walked the land, free to do as they\npleased. Chaos, beyond dreaming. They bred with humans, and their\noffspring were half-breeds. Part man, part demon. Devil-bloods. Monsters.\nOne among them took the name Euz. He delivered humanity from the\ntyranny of devils, and the fury of his battle with them shaped the land. He\nsplit the world above from the world below, and he sealed the gates\nbetween. To prevent such terror ever coming again, he pronounced the First\nLaw. It is forbidden to touch the Other Side direct, or to speak with devils.”\nLogen watched the others watch Ferro. Luthar and Quai both frowning\nat this uncanny display of archery. She leaned right back in her saddle,\nbowstring drawn as tight as it would go, glittering point of the next shaft\nheld perfectly steady, still managing to nudge her mount this way and that\nwith her heels. Logen could scarcely make a horse do what he wanted with\nthe reins in his hands, but he failed to see what Bayaz’s crazy story had to\ndo with it. “Devils and so on, the First Law.” Logen waved his hand. “So\nwhat?”\n“From the start the First Law was filled with contradictions. All magic\ncomes from the Other Side, falling upon the land as the light falls from the\nsun. Euz himself was part devil, and so were his sons—Juvens, Kanedias,\nGlustrod—and others besides. Their blood brought them gifts, and curses.\nPower, and long life, and strength or sight beyond the limits of simple men.\nTheir blood passed on into their children, growing ever thinner, into their\nchildren’s children, and so on through the long centuries. The gifts skipped\none generation, then another, then came but rarely. The devil-blood grew\nthin, and died out. It is rare indeed now, when our world and the world\nbelow have drifted so far apart, to see those gifts made flesh. We truly are\nprivileged to witness it.”\nLogen raised his eyebrows. “Her? Half devil?”\n“Much less than half, my friend.” Bayaz chuckled. “Euz himself was\nhalf, and his power threw up the mountains and gouged out the seas. Half\ncould strike a horror and a desire into your blood to stop your heart. Half\ncould blind you to look upon. Not half. No more than a fraction. But in her,\nthere is a trace of the Other Side.”\n“The Other Side, eh?” Logen looked down at the dead bird in his hand.\n“So if I was to touch her, would I break the First Law?”\nBayaz chuckled. “Now, that is a sharp question. You always surprise me,\nMaster Ninefingers. I wonder what Euz would say to it?” The Magus pursed"

There was a huddle of buildings on the\nside nearest them, or the shells of buildings. No roofs left, nothing but the\ntumbledown walls, mostly no more than waist high, the fallen stones from\nthem scattered across the valley’s slopes, in amongst the waving grass. It\ncould have been a scene out of the North. Lots of villages abandoned there,\nsince the wars. People driven out, dragged out, burned out. Logen had\nwatched it happen, often. He’d joined in more than once. He wasn’t proud\nof it, but he wasn’t proud of much from those times. Or any other, come to\nthink of it.\n“Not a lot left to live in,” whispered Luthar.\nFerro scowled at him. “Plenty left to hide behind.”\nEvening was coming on, the sun had dropped low on the horizon and\nfilled the broken village up with shadows. There was no sign of anyone\ndown there. No sounds beyond the giggling water, the slow wind slithering\nthrough the grass. No sign of anyone, but Ferro was right. No sign didn’t\nnecessarily mean no danger.\n“You had best go down there and take a look,” murmured Longfoot.\n“I best?” Logen glanced sideways at him. “You’re staying here then,\neh?”\n“I have no talent for fights. You are well aware of that.”\n“Huh,” muttered Logen. “No talent for the sorting of fights, plenty for\nthe finding of ’em though.”\n“Finding things is what I do. I’m here to navigate.”\n“Maybe you could find me a decent meal and a bed to sleep in,” snapped\nLuthar, in his whining Union accent.\nFerro sucked her teeth with disgust. “Someone’s got to go,” she\ngrowled, sliding over the lip of the slope on her belly. “I’ll take the left.”\nNo one else moved. “Us too,” Logen grunted at Luthar.\n“Me?”\n“Who else? Three’s a good number. Let’s go, and let’s keep it stealthy.”\nLuthar peered through the grass into the valley, licked his lips, rubbed\nhis palms together. Nervous, Logen could tell, nervous but proud at the\nsame time, like an untried boy before a battle, trying to show he’s not\nscared by sticking his chin out. Logen wasn’t fooled. He’d seen it all a\nhundred times before.\n“You planning to wait for the morning?” he grunted.\n“Just keep your mind on your own shortcomings, Northman,” hissed\nLuthar as he started to wriggle forward down the slope. “You’ve enough of\nthem!” The rowels of his big, shiny spurs rattled loud as he dragged himself\nover the edge, clumsy and unpractised, his arse sticking up in the air."

Stealthy, I said! You might as well hang a bell off\nyour cock!”\nLuthar scowled as he sat up to pull them off.\n“Stay down!” hissed Logen, pushing him back into the grass on his\nback. “You want to get us killed?”\n“Get off me!”\nLogen shoved him down again, then stabbed at him with his finger to\nmake sure he got the point. “I’m not dying over your fucking spurs and\nthat’s a fact! If you can’t keep quiet you can stay here with the Navigator.”\nHe glowered over at Longfoot. “Maybe you both can navigate your way\ninto the village once we’ve made sure it’s safe.” He shook his head and\ncrawled down the slope after Ferro.\nShe was already halfway to the brook, rolling and slithering over the\ncrumbled walls, sneaking across the spaces in between them, keeping low,\nhand on the grip of her curved sword, quick and silent as the wind over the\nplain.\nImpressive, no doubt, but Logen was nobody’s fool when it came to a\nspot of sneaking. He’d been known for it, when he was younger. Lost count\nof the number of Shanka, the number of men he’d come up behind. “The\nfirst you’ll hear of the Bloody-Nine is the blood hissing out of your neck”—\nthat used to be the rumour. Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say that\nhe’s stealthy.\nHe flowed up to the first wall, slid one leg over it, silent as a mouse. He\nlifted himself up, smooth as butter, keeping quiet, keeping low. His back\nfoot caught on a set of loose stones, dragged them scraping with him. He\ngrabbed at them, fumbled them, knocked over even more with his elbow,\nand they clattered down loud around him. He stumbled onto his weak ankle,\ntwisted it, squawked with pain, fell over, and rolled through a patch of\nthistles.\n“Shit,” he grunted, struggling up, one hand clutching at the hilt of his\nsword, all tangled up with his coat. Good thing he hadn’t had it out, or he\ncould’ve stuck himself through with it. Happened to a friend of his. So busy\nshouting that he tripped on a tree root and cut a big piece out of his head on\nhis own axe. Back to the mud double time.\nHe crouched among the fallen stones, waiting for someone to jump him.\nNo one came. Just the wind breathing through the gaps in the old walls, the\nwater chuckling away in the brook. He crept along beside a heap of rough\nstones, through an old doorway, slithered over a slumping wall, limping and\ngasping on his bad foot, scarcely making any effort to stay quiet any longer.\nThere was no one there. He’d known it as soon as he fell. No way they\ncould have missed that sorry performance. The Dogman would most likely"

The Dogman would most likely\nhave been weeping right about now, had he been alive. He waved up at the\nridge, and a moment later he saw Longfoot stand up and wave as well.\n“No one here,” he muttered to himself.\n“Just as well,” hissed Ferro’s voice, not more than a stride or two\nbehind. “You got a new way of scouting, pink. Make so much noise that\nthey come to you.”\n“Out of practice,” grunted Logen. “Still, no harm done. No one here.”\n“There was.” She was standing in the shell of one of the ruined\nbuildings, frowning down at the ground. A burned patch in the grass, a few\nstones set around it. A campfire.\n“No more ’n a day or two old,” muttered Logen, poking at the ashes\nwith a finger.\nLuthar walked up behind them. “No one here after all.” He had a smug,\nsucked-in look on his face, like he’d somehow been right about something\nall along. Logen didn’t see what.\n“Lucky for you there isn’t, or we might be stitching you together right\nabout now!”\n“I’d be stitching the fucking pair of you!” hissed Ferro. “I ought to stitch\nyour useless pink heads together! You’re both as worthless as a bag of sand\nin the desert! There’s tracks over there. Horses, more than one cart.”\n“Merchants maybe?” asked Logen, hopefully. He and Ferro looked at\neach other for a moment. “Might be better if we stay off the track from now\non.”\n“Too slow.” Bayaz had made it down into the village now. Quai and\nLongfoot weren’t far behind with the cart and the horses. “Far too slow. We\nstick to the track. We’ll see anyone coming in good time out here. Plenty of\ntime.”\nLuthar didn’t look convinced. “If we see them, they’ll see us. What\nthen?”\n“Then?” Bayaz raised an eyebrow. “Then we have the famous Captain\nLuthar to protect us.” He looked round at the ruined village. “Running\nwater, and shelter, of a kind. Seems like a good place to camp.”\n“Good enough,” muttered Logen, already rooting through the cart for\nlogs to start a fire of their own. “I’m hungry. What happened to those\nbirds?”\nL\nogen sat, and watched the others eat over the rim of his pot.\nFerro squatted at the very edge of the shifting light from the campfire,\nhunched over, shadowy face almost stuck right into her bowl, staring\naround suspiciously and shoving food in with her fingers like she was\nworried it might be snatched away any moment. Luthar was less\nenthusiastic. He was nibbling daintily at a wing with his bared front teeth,\nas though touching it with his lips might poison him, discarded morsels\nlined up carefully along the side of his platter. Bayaz chewed away with\nsome relish, his beard glistening with gravy. “It’s good,” he muttered\naround a mouthful. “You might want to consider cookery as a career,"

        "text": "some relish, his beard glistening with gravy. “It’s good,” he muttered\naround a mouthful. “You might want to consider cookery as a career,\nMaster Ninefingers, if you should ever grow tired of”—he waved his spoon\n—“whatever it is you do.”\n“Huh,” said Logen. In the North everyone took their turn at the fire, and\nit was reckoned an honour to do it. A good cook was almost as valued as a\ngood fighter. Not here. These were a sorry crowd when it came to minding\nthe pot. Bayaz could just about get his tea boiled, and that was as far as he\nwent. Quai could get a biscuit out of the box on a good day. Logen doubted\nwhether Luthar would even have known which way up the pot went. As for\nFerro, she seemed to despise the whole notion of cooking. Logen reckoned\nshe was used to eating her food raw. Perhaps while it was still alive.\nIn the North, after a hard day on the trail, when the men gathered around\nthe long fires to eat, there was a strict order to who sat where. The chief\nwould go at the top, with his sons and the Named Men of the clan around\nhim. Next came the Carls, in order of fame. Thralls were lucky to get their\nown small fires further out. Men would always have their place, and only\nchange it when their chief offered, out of respect for some great service\nthey’d done him, or for showing rare good bones in a fight. Sitting out of\nplace could earn you a kicking, or a killing even. Where you sat round the\nfire was where you stood in life, more or less.\nIt was different out here on the plains, but Logen could still see a pattern\nin who sat where, and it was far from a happy one. He and Bayaz were\nclose enough to the fire, but the others were further than comfort would\nhave put them. Drawn close by the wind, and the cold, and the damp night,\npushed further out by each other. He glanced over at Luthar, sneering down\ninto his bowl as though it was full of piss. No respect. He glanced over at\nFerro, staring yellow knives at him through narrowed eyes. No trust. He\nshook his head sadly. Without trust and respect the group would fall apart in\na fight, like walls without mortar.\nStill, Logen had won over tougher audiences, in his time. Threetrees, Tul\nDuru, Black Dow, Harding Grim—he’d fought each one in single combat,\nand beaten them all. Spared each man’s life, and left him bound to follow.\nEach one had tried their best to kill him, and with good reasons too, but in\nthe end Logen had earned their trust, and their respect, and their friendship\neven. Small gestures and a lot of time, that was how he’d done it. “Patience\nis the chief of virtues,” his father used to say, and “you won’t cross the\nmountains in a day.” Time might be against them, but there was nothing to\nbe gained by rushing. You have to be realistic about these things.\nLogen uncrossed his stiff legs, took hold of the water-skin, and got up,\nwalked slowly over to where Ferro was sitting. Her eyes followed him all"

She was a strange one, no doubt, and not just the looks of\nher, though the dead knew her looks were strange enough. She seemed hard\nand sharp and cold as a new sword, ruthless as any man that Logen could\nthink of. You would have thought she wouldn’t throw a log to save a\ndrowning man, but she’d done more than that to save him, and more than\nonce. Out of all of them, she was the one he’d trust first, and furthest. So he\nsquatted down and held the skin out to her, its bulbous shadow flickering\nand shifting on the rough wall behind her.\nShe frowned at it for a moment, then frowned up at Logen. Then she\nsnatched it off him and bent back over her pot, half turning her bony\nshoulders on him. Not a word of thanks, or a gesture even, but he didn’t\nmind. You won’t cross the mountains in a day, after all.\nHe dropped down again beside the fire, watched the flames dancing,\ncasting shifting light across the grim faces of the group. “Anyone know any\nstories?” he asked hopefully.\nQuai sucked at his teeth. Luthar curled his lip at Logen across the fire.\nFerro gave no sign that she had even heard. Hardly an encouraging start.\n“Not any?” No reply. “Alright then, I know a song or two, if I can\nremember the words.” He cleared his throat.\n“Very well!” cut in Bayaz. “If it will save us from a song, I know\nhundreds of stories. What did you have it in mind to hear about? A\nromance? A comedy? A tale of bravery against the odds?”\n“This place,” cut in Luthar. “The Old Empire. If it was such a great\nnation, how did it come to this?” He jerked his head over at the crumbling\nwalls, and what they all knew lay beyond. The miles and miles of nothing.\n“A wasteland.”\nBayaz sighed. “I could tell that tale, but we are lucky enough to have a\nnative of the Old Empire with us on our little trip, and a keen student of\nhistory to boot. Master Quai?” The apprentice looked up lazily from the\nfire. “Would you care to enlighten us? How did the Empire, once the\nglittering centre of the world, come to this pass?”\n“That story is long in the telling,” murmured the apprentice. “Shall I\nstart from the beginning?”\n“Where else should a man ever start?”\nQuai shrugged his bony shoulders and began to speak. “Almighty Euz,\nvanquisher of demons, closer of gates, father of the World, had four sons,\nand to each he gave a gift. To his eldest, Juvens, he gave the talent of High\nArt, the skill to change the world with magic, tempered by knowledge. To\nhis second son, Kanedias, went the gift of making, of shaping stone and\nmetal to his own purposes. To his third son, Bedesh, Euz gave the skill of\nspeaking with spirits, and of making them do his bidding.” Quai gave a"

To his third son, Bedesh, Euz gave the skill of\nspeaking with spirits, and of making them do his bidding.” Quai gave a\nwide yawn, smacked his lips, and blinked at the fire. “So were born the\nthree pure disciplines of magic.”\n“I thought he had four sons,” grumbled Luthar.\nQuai’s eyes slid sideways. “So he did, and therein lies the root of the\nEmpire’s destruction. Glustrod was the youngest son. To him should have\ngone the gift of communing with the Other Side. The secrets of summoning\ndevils from the world below and binding them to one’s will. But such things\nwere forbidden by the First Law, and so Euz gave nothing to his youngest\nson but his blessing, and we all know what those are worth. He taught the\nother three their share of his secrets and left, ordering his sons to bring\norder to the world.”\n“Order.” Luthar tossed his platter down on the grass beside him and\nglanced disdainfully round at the shadowy ruins. “They didn’t get far.”\n“At first they did. Juvens set about his purpose with a will, and bent all\nhis power and all his wisdom to it. He found a people that pleased him,\nliving beside the Aos, and favoured them with laws and learning,\ngovernment and science. He gave to them the skills to conquer their\nneighbours, and made of their chief an Emperor. Son followed father, year\nfollowed year, and the nation grew and prospered. The lands of the Empire\nstretched as far as Isparda in the south, Anconus in the north, the very\nshores of the Circle Sea to the east, and beyond. Emperor followed\nEmperor, but always Juvens was there—guiding, advising, shaping all\nthings according to his grand design. All was civilised, all was peaceful, all\nwas content.”\n“Almost all,” muttered Bayaz, poking at the guttering fire with a stick.\nQuai gave a smirk. “We have forgotten Glustrod, just as his father did.\nThe ignored son. The shunned son. The cheated son. He begged all three\nbrothers for a share of their secrets, but they were jealous of their gifts, and\nall three refused him. He looked upon what Juvens had achieved, and was\nbitter beyond words. He found dark places in the world, and in secret he\nstudied those sciences forbidden by the First Law. He found dark places in\nthe world, and he touched the Other Side. He found dark places, and he\nspoke in the tongue of devils, and he heard their voices answer him.” Quai’s\nvoice dropped down to a whisper. “And the voices told Glustrod where to\ndig…”\n“Very good, Master Quai,” cut in Bayaz, sternly. “Your grip on the\nhistories seems much improved. Let us not tarry on the details, however. We\ncan leave Glustrod’s diggings for another day.”\n“Of course,” murmured Quai, his dark eyes glittering in the firelight, his\ngaunt face full of gloomy hollows. “You know best, master.

It did not take him long to turn the weak-willed\nto his purposes, and the strong-willed against each other, for he was\ncunning, and charming, and fair to look upon. He heard the voices always,\nnow, from the world below. They suggested that he sow discord\neverywhere, and he listened. They urged him to eat the flesh of men, and\nsteal their power, and he did so. They commanded him to seek out those\ndevil-bloods that remained in our world, spurned, hated, exiled, and make\nof them an army, and he obeyed.”\nSomething touched Logen’s shoulder from behind and he near jumped\nin the air. Ferro was standing over him, the water-skin held out in her hand.\n“Thanks,” he growled as he took it from her, pretending that his heart\nwasn’t knocking at his ribs. He took a quick swig and banged the stopper in\nwith his palm, then put it down beside him. When he looked up, Ferro\nhadn’t moved. She stood there above him, looking down at the dancing\nflames. Logen shuffled up a step, making room. Ferro scowled, sucked her\nteeth, kicked at the ground, then slowly squatted down on her haunches,\nmaking sure to leave plenty of space between them. She held her hands out\nto the fire and bared her shining teeth at it.\n“Cold over there.”\nLogen nodded. “These walls don’t keep the wind off much.”\n“No.” Her eyes swept across the group and found Quai. “Don’t stop for\nme,” she snapped.\nThe apprentice grinned. “Strange and sinister was the host that Glustrod\ngathered. He waited for Juvens to leave the Empire, then he crept into the\ncapital at Aulcus and set his well-laid schemes in motion. It seemed as if a\nmadness swept the city. Son fought with father, wife with husband,\nneighbour with neighbour. The Emperor was cut down on the steps of his\npalace by his own sons and then, maddened with greed and envy, they\nturned upon each other. Glustrod’s twisted army had slithered into the\nsewers beneath the city and rose up, turning the streets into charnel pits, the\nsquares into slaughter yards. Some among them could take forms, stealing\nthe faces of others.”\nBayaz shook his head. “Taking forms. A dread and insidious trick.”\nLogen remembered a woman, in the cold darkness, who had spoken with\nthe voice of his dead wife, and he frowned and hunched his shoulders.\n“A dread trick indeed,” said Quai, his sickly grin growing even wider.\n“For who can be trusted if one cannot trust one’s own eyes, one’s own ears,\nto tell friend from foe? But worse was to come. Glustrod summoned\ndemons from the Other Side, bound them to his will, and sent them to\ndestroy those who might resist him.”\n“Summoning and sending,” hissed Bayaz. “Cursed disciplines. Dire\nrisks. Terrible breaches of the First Law.”"

Terrible breaches of the First Law.”\n“But Glustrod recognised no law beyond his own strength. Soon he sat\nin the Emperor’s throne room upon a pile of skulls, sucking the flesh of men\nas a baby sucks milk, basking in his awful victory. The Empire descended\ninto chaos, the very slightest taste of the chaos of ancient days, before the\ncoming of Euz, when our world and the world below were one.”\nA gust of wind sighed through the chinks in the ancient stonework\naround them, and Logen shivered and pulled his blanket tight around him.\nDamn story was making him nervous. Stealing faces, and sending devils,\nand eating men. But Quai did not stop. “When he found out what Glustrod\nhad done, Juvens’ fury was terrible, and he sought the aid of his brothers.\nKanedias would not come. He stayed sealed in his house, tinkering with his\nmachines, caring nothing for the world outside. Juvens and Bedesh raised\nan army without him, and they fought a war against their brother.”\n“A terrible war,” muttered Bayaz, “with terrible weapons, and terrible\ncasualties.”\n“The fighting spread across the continent from one end to the other, and\ndrew in every petty rivalry, and gave birth to a host of feuds, and crimes,\nand vengeances, whose consequences still poison the world today. But in\nthe end Juvens was victorious. Glustrod was besieged in Aulcus, his\nchangelings unmasked, his army scattered. Now, in his most desperate\nmoment, the voices from the world below whispered to him a plan. Open a\ngate to the Other Side, they said. Pick the locks, and crack the seals, and\nthrow wide the doors that your father made. Break the First Law one last\ntime, they said, and let us back into the world, and you will never again be\nignored, be shunned, be cheated.”\nThe First of the Magi nodded slowly to himself. “But he was cheated\nonce more.”\n“Poor fool! The creatures of the Other Side are made of lies. To deal\nwith them is to grasp the most awful peril. Glustrod made ready his rituals,\nbut in his haste he made some small mistake. Only a grain of salt out of\nplace, perhaps, but the results were horrible indeed. The great power that\nGlustrod had gathered, strong enough to tear a hole in the fabric of the\nworld, was released without form or reason. Glustrod destroyed himself.\nAulcus, great and beautiful capital of the Empire, was laid waste, the land\naround it forever poisoned. No one ventures within miles of the place now.\nThe city is a shattered graveyard. A blasted ruin. A fitting monument to the\nfolly and the pride of Glustrod and his brothers.” The apprentice glanced up\nat Bayaz. “Do I speak the truth, master?”\n“You do,” murmured the Magus. “I know. I saw it. A young fool with a\nfull and lustrous head of hair.” He ran a hand over his bald scalp. “A young\nfool who was as ignorant of magic, and wisdom, and the ways of power as\nyou are now, Master Quai.”"

How did you like that\ntale, Master Ninefingers?”\nLogen puffed out his cheeks. “I’d been hoping for something with a few\nmore laughs, but I guess I’ll take what’s offered.”\n“A pack of nonsense, if you ask me,” sneered Luthar.\n“Huh,” snorted Bayaz. “How fortunate for us that no one did. Perhaps\nyou ought to get the pots washed, Captain, before it gets too late.”\n“Me?”\n“One of us caught the food, and one of us cooked it. One of us has\nentertained the group with a tale. You are the only one among us who has as\nyet contributed nothing.”\n“Apart from you.”\n“Oh, I am far too old to be sloshing around in streams at this time of\nnight.” Bayaz’s face grew hard. “A great man must first learn humility. The\npots await.”\nLuthar opened his mouth to speak, thought better of it, pushed himself\nangrily up from his place, and threw his blanket down in the grass. “Damn\npots,” he cursed as he snatched them up from around the fire and stomped\noff towards the brook.\nFerro watched him go, a strange expression on her face that might even\nhave been her version of a smile. She looked back at the fire, and licked her\nlips. Logen pulled the stopper from the water-skin and held it out to her.\n“Uh,” she grunted, snatched it from his hand, took a quick swallow.\nWhile she was wiping her mouth on her sleeve, she glanced sideways at\nhim, and frowned. “What?”\n“Nothing,” he said quickly, looking away and holding up his empty\npalms. “Nothing at all.” He was smiling on the inside, though. Small\ngestures and time. That was how he’d get it done.\nSmall Crimes\nC\nold, eh, Colonel West?”\n“Yes, Your Highness, winter is nearly upon us.” There had been a kind\nof snow in the night. A cold, wet sleet that covered everything in icy\nmoisture. Now, in the pale morning, the whole world seemed half-frozen.\nThe hooves of their horses crunched and slurped in the half-frozen mud.\nWater dripped sadly from the half-frozen trees. West was no exception. His\nbreath smoked from his runny nose. The tips of his ears tingled\nunpleasantly, numb from the cold.\nPrince Ladisla hardly seemed to notice, but then he was swathed in an\nenormous coat, hat, and mittens of shining black fur, no doubt several\nhundred marks’ worth of it. He grinned over. “The men seem good and fit,\nthough, in spite of it all.”\nWest could scarcely believe his ears.

Their wide tents were pitched in orderly rows in the middle of the\ncamp, cooking fires in front, horses tethered nearby in good order.\nThe position of the levies, who made up a good three-quarters of their\nstrength, was less happy. Many were shamefully ill-prepared. Men with no\ntraining or no weapons, some who were plainly too ill or too old for\nmarching, let alone for battle. Some had little more than the clothes they\nstood up in, and those were in a woeful state. West had seen men huddled\ntogether under trees for warmth, nothing but half a blanket to keep the rain\noff. It was a disgrace.\n“The King’s Own are well provided for, but I’m concerned about the\nsituation of some of the levies, Your—”\n“Yes,” said Ladisla, talking over him precisely as if he had not spoken,\n“good and fit! Chomping at the bit! Must be the fire in their bellies keeps\n’em warm, eh, West? Can’t wait to get at the enemy! Damn shame we have\nto wait here, kicking our heels behind this damn river!”\nWest bit his lip. Prince Ladisla’s incredible powers of self-deception\nwere becoming more frustrating with every passing day. His Highness had\nfixed upon the idea of being a great and famous General, with a matchless\nforce of fighting men under his command. Of winning a famous victory,\nand being celebrated as a hero back in Adua. Rather than exerting a single\nparticle of effort to make it happen, however, he behaved as if it already\nhad, utterly regardless of the truth. Nothing which was distasteful, or\ndispleasing, or at odds with his cock-eyed notions could be permitted to be\nnoticed. Meanwhile, the dandies on his staff, without a month’s military\nexperience between them, congratulated him on his fine judgement, slapped\neach other on the back, and agreed with his every utterance, no matter how\nludicrous.\nNever to want for anything, or work for anything, or show the tiniest\ngrain of self-discipline in a whole life must give a man a strange outlook on\nthe world, West supposed, and here was the proof, riding along beside him,\nsmiling away as though the care of ten thousand men was a light\nresponsibility. The Crown Prince and the real world, as Lord Marshal Burr\nhad observed, were entire strangers to one another.\n“Cold,” Ladisla murmured. “Not much like the deserts of Gurkhul now,\neh, Colonel West?”\n“No, Your Highness.”\n“But some things are the same, eh? I’m speaking of war, West! War in\ngeneral! The same everywhere! The courage! The honour! The glory! You\nfought with Colonel Glokta, didn’t you?”\n“Yes, Your Highness, I did.”\n“I used to love to hear stories of that man’s exploits! One of my heroes,\nwhen I was young. Riding round the enemy, harassing his lines of\ncommunication, falling on the baggage train and whatnot.” The Prince’s\nriding crop rode around, harassed, and fell on imaginary baggage in the air\nbefore him. “Capital!

We could do with some of that dash here, eh,\nWest? Some of that vim! That vigour! Shame that he’s dead.”\nWest looked up. “He isn’t dead, Your Highness.”\n“He isn’t?”\n“He was captured by the Gurkish, and then returned to the Union when\nthe war ended. He… er… he joined the Inquisition.”\n“The Inquisition?” The Prince looked horrified. “Why on earth would a\nman give up the soldiering life for that?”\nWest groped for words, but then thought better of it. “I cannot imagine,\nYour Highness.”\n“Joined the Inquisition! Well, I never.” They rode in silence for a\nmoment. Gradually, the Prince’s smile returned. “But we were talking of the\nhonour of war, were we not?”\nWest grimaced. “We were, Your Highness.”\n“First through the breach at Ulrioch, weren’t you?

Half-blind with the smoke, half choking on the dust,\nshrieks and wails and the clashing of metal coming at him from all around,\nhardly able to breathe for fear. Men pressing in on all sides, groaning,\nshoving, stumbling, yelling, running with blood and sweat, black with\ngrime and soot, half-seen faces twisted with pain and fury. Devils, in hell.\nWest remembered screaming “Forward!” over and over until his throat\nwas raw, even though he had no idea which way forward was. He\nremembered stabbing someone with his sword—friend or enemy, he did not\nknow, then or now. He remembered falling and cutting his head on a rock,\ntearing his jacket on a broken timber. Moments, fragments, as if from a\nstory he once heard someone else telling.\nWest pulled his coat tighter round his chilly shoulders, wishing it was\nthicker. “Quite an experience, Your Highness.”\n“Damn shame that bloody Bethod won’t be coming this way!” Prince\nLadisla slashed petulantly at the air with his riding crop. “Little better than\ndamn guard duty! Does Burr take me for a fool, eh, West, does he?”\nWest took a deep breath. “I couldn’t possibly say, Your Highness.”\nThe Prince’s fickle mind had already moved off. “What about those pets\nof yours? Those Northmen. The ones with the comical names. What’s he\ncalled, that dirty fellow? Wolfman, is it?”\n“Dogman.”\n“Dogman, that’s it! Capital!” The Prince chuckled to himself. “And that\nother one, biggest damn fellow I ever saw! Excellent! What are they up to?”"

What are they up to?”\n“I sent them scouting north of the river, Your Highness.” West rather\nwished he was with them. “The enemy are probably far away, but if they\naren’t, we need to know about it.”\n“Of course we do. Excellent idea. So that we can prepare to attack!”\nA timely withdrawal and a fast messenger to Marshal Burr was more\nwhat West had in mind, but there was no point in saying so. Ladisla’s whole\nnotion of war was of ordering a glorious charge, then retiring to bed.\nStrategy and retreat were not words in his vocabulary.\n“Yes,” the Prince was muttering to himself, eyes fixed intently on the\ntrees beyond the river. “Prepare an attack and sweep them back across the\nborder…”\nThe border was a hundred leagues away. West seized his moment. “Your\nHighness, if I may, there is a great deal for me to do.”\nIt was no lie. The camp had been organised, or disorganised, without a\nthought for convenience or defence. An unruly maze of ramshackle canvas\nin a great clearing near the river, where the ground was too soft and had\nsoon been turned into a morass of sticky mud by the supply carts. At first\nthere had been no latrines, then they had been dug too shallow and much\ntoo close to the camp, not far from where the provisions were being stored.\nProvisions which, incidentally, had been badly packed, inadequately\nprepared, and were already close to spoiling, attracting every rat in\nAngland. If it had not been for the cold, West did not doubt that the camp\nwould already have been riddled with disease.\nPrince Ladisla waved his hand. “Of course, a great deal to do. You can\ntell me more of your stories tomorrow, eh, West? About Colonel Glokta and\nso forth. Damn shame he’s dead!” he shouted over his shoulder as he\ncantered off towards his enormous purple tent, high up on the hill above the\nstink and confusion.\nWest turned his mount with some relief and urged it down the slope into\nthe camp. He passed men tottering through the half-frozen sludge,\nshivering, breath steaming, hands wrapped in dirty rags. He passed men\nsitting in sorry groups before their patched tents, no two dressed the same,\nas close to meagre fires as they dared, fiddling with cooking pots, playing\nmiserable games of damp cards, drinking, and staring into the cold air.\nThe better-trained levies had gone with Poulder and Kroy to seek out the\nenemy. Ladisla had been left with the rump: those too weak to march well,\ntoo poorly equipped to fight well, too broken even to do nothing with any\nconviction. Men who might never have left their homes in all their lives,\nforced to cross the sea to a land they knew nothing of, to fight an enemy\nthey had no quarrel with, for reasons they did not understand.\nSome few of them might have felt some trace of patriotic fervour, some\nswell of manly pride when they left, but by now the hard marching, the bad\nfood, and the cold weather had truly worn, starved, and frozen all"

Prince Ladisla was scarcely the inspirational leader\nto put it back, had he even been making the slightest effort to do so.\nWest looked down at those grim, tired, pinched faces as he rode past,\nand they stared back, beaten already. All they wanted was to go home, and\nWest could hardly blame them. So did he.\n“Colonel West!”\nThere was a big man grinning over at him, a man with a thick beard,\nwearing the uniform of an officer in the King’s Own. West realised with a\nstart that it was Jalenhorm. He slid down from his saddle and grabbed hold\nof the big man’s hand in both of his. It was good to see him. A firm, honest,\ntrustworthy presence. A reminder of a past life, when West did not move\namong the great men of the world, and things were an awful lot simpler.\n“How are you, Jalenhorm?”\n“Alright, thank you, sir. Just taking a turn round the camp, waiting.” The\nbig man cupped his hands and blew into them, rubbed them together.\n“Trying to stay warm.”\n“That’s what war is, in my experience. A great deal of waiting, in\nunpleasant conditions. A great deal of waiting, with occasional moments of\nthe most extreme terror.”\nJalenhorm gave a dry grin. “Something to look forward to then. How’re\nthings on the Prince’s staff?”\nWest shook his head. “A competition to see who can be most arrogant,\nignorant, and wasteful. How about you? How’s the camp life?”\n“We’re not so badly off. It’s some of these levies I feel sorry for. They’re\nnot fit to fight. I heard a couple of the older ones died last night from the\ncold.”\n“It happens. Let’s just hope they bury them deep, and a good way from\nthe rest of us.” West could see that the big man thought him heartless, but\nthere it was. Few of the casualties in Gurkhul had died in battle. Accidents,\nillness, little wounds gone bad. You came to expect it. As badly equipped as\nsome of the levies were? They would be burying men every day. “Nothing\nyou need?”\n“There is one thing. My horse dropped a shoe in this mud, and I tried to\nfind someone to fit a new one.” Jalenhorm spread his hands. “I could be\nwrong, but I don’t think there’s a smith in the whole camp.”\nWest stared at him. “Not one?”\n“I couldn’t find any. There are forges, anvils, hammers, and all the rest\nbut… no one to work them. I spoke to one of the quartermasters. He said\nGeneral Poulder refused to release any of his smiths, and so did General\nKroy, so, well,”—and Jalenhorm shrugged his shoulders—“we don’t have\nany.”\n“No one thought to check?”\n“Who?”\nWest felt the familiar headache tugging at the back of his eyes.

Arrows\nneed heads, blades need sharpening, armour and saddles and the carts that\nhaul the supplies break, and need to be repaired. An army with no smiths is\nlittle better than an army with no weapons. And here they were, out in the\nfrozen country, miles from the nearest settlement. Unless…\n“We passed a penal colony on the way.”\nJalenhorm squinted as he tried to remember. “Yes, a foundry, I think. I\nsaw smoke above the trees…”\n“They would have some skilled metal-workers.”\nThe big man’s eyebrows went up. “Some criminal metal-workers.”\n“I’ll take whatever we can get. Today your horse is short a shoe,\ntomorrow we might have nothing to fight with! Get a dozen men together,\nand a wagon. We’ll leave at once.”\nT\nhe prison loomed up out of the trees through the cold rain, a fence of\ngreat, mossy logs tipped with bent and rusted spikes. A grim-looking place\nwith a grim purpose. West swung from his saddle while Jalenhorm and his\nmen reined up behind him, then squelched across the rutted track to the gate\nand hammered on the weathered wood with the pommel of his sword.\nIt took a while, but eventually a small hatch snapped open. A pair of\ngrey eyes frowned at him through the slot. Grey eyes above a black mask. A\nPractical of the Inquisition.\n“My name is Colonel West.”\nThe eyes regarded him coldly. “So?”\n“I am in the service of Crown Prince Ladisla, and I need to speak to the\ncommandant of this camp.”\n“Why?”\nWest frowned, doing his very best to look impressive with his hair\nplastered to his scalp and the rain dripping off his chin. “There is a war on\nand I do not have time to bandy words with you! I need to speak to the\ncommandant most urgently!”\nThe eyes narrowed. They looked at West for a while, and then at the\ndozen bedraggled soldiers behind him. “Alright,” said the Practical. “You\ncan come in, but only you. The rest will have to wait.”\nThe main street was a stretch of churned-up mud between leaning\nshacks, water trickling from the eaves, spattering into the dirt. There were\ntwo men and a woman in the road, wet through, struggling to move a cart\nladen with stones, up to the axles in mush. All three had heavy chains on\ntheir ankles. Ragged, bony, hollow faces, as empty of hope as they were\nempty of food.\n“Get that fucking cart shifted,” the Practical growled at them, and they\nstooped back to their unenviable task.\nWest struggled through the muck towards a stone building at the far end\nof the camp, trying to hop from one dry patch to another, without success.\nAnother dour Practical was standing on the threshold, water running from a\nstained oilskin over his shoulders, hard eyes following West with a mixture\nof suspicion and indifference. He and his guide stepped past without a word\nand into the dim hall beyond, full of the noise of drumming rain. The\nPractical knocked at an ill-fitting door.\n“Come in.”"

The\nPractical knocked at an ill-fitting door.\n“Come in.”\nA small, spare room with grey walls, cold and smelling slightly of damp.\nA mean fire flickered in the grate, a sagging shelf was stacked with books.\nA portrait of the King of the Union stared regally down from one wall. A\nlean man in a black coat sat writing at a cheap desk. He looked at West for a\nwhile, then carefully put down his pen and rubbed at the bridge of his nose\nwith an inky thumb and forefinger.\n“We have a visitor,” grunted the Practical.\n“So I see. I am Inquisitor Lorsen, commandant of our little camp.”\nWest gave the bony hand the most perfunctory of squeezes. “Colonel\nWest. I am here with Prince Ladisla’s army. We are camped a dozen miles\nto the north.”\n“Of course. How might I be of assistance to His Highness?”\n“We are desperately in need of skilled metal-workers. You run a foundry\nhere, correct?”\n“A mine, a foundry, and a smithy for the manufacture of farming tools,\nbut I fail to see what—”\n“Excellent. I will take a dozen or so men back with me, the most skilled\nmen you have available.”\nThe commandant frowned. “Out of the question. The prisoners here are\nguilty of the most serious crimes. They cannot be released without a signed\norder from the Arch Lector himself.”\n“Then we have a problem, Inquisitor Lorsen. I have ten thousand men\nwith weapons that need sharpening, armour that needs mending, horses that\nneed shoeing. We might be called into action at any moment. I cannot wait\nfor orders from the Arch Lector or anyone else. I must leave with smiths,\nand there it is.”\n“But you must understand that I cannot allow—”\n“You fail to realise the gravity of the situation!” barked West, his temper\nalready fraying. “By all means send a letter to the Arch Lector! I will send a\nman back to my camp for a company of soldiers! We can see who gets help\nfirst!”\nThe commandant thought about that for a while. “Very well,” he said\neventually, “follow me.”\nTwo dirty children stared at West from the porch of one of the shacks as\nhe stepped out of the commandant’s building, back into the incessant\ndrizzle.\n“You have children here?”\n“We have whole families, if they are judged a danger to the state.”\nLorsen glanced sideways at him. “A shame, but holding the Union together\nhas always required harsh measures. I gather from your silence that you\ndisapprove.”\nWest watched one of the shabby children limping through the muck,\ndoomed, perhaps, to spend their whole life in this place. “I think it’s a\ncrime.”\nThe commandant shrugged. “Don’t deceive yourself. Everyone is guilty\nof something, and even the innocent can be a threat. Perhaps it takes small\ncrimes to prevent bigger ones, Colonel West, but it’s up to bigger men than\nus to decide. I only make sure they work hard, don’t prey upon each other,\nand don’t escape.”"

A well-trodden way to avoid responsibility.”\n“Which of us is it who lives among them, out here in the middle of\nnowhere? Which of us is it who watches over them, dresses them, feeds\nthem, cleans them, fights the endless, pointless war against their damn lice?\nIs it you who stops them beating, and raping, and killing each other? You’re\nan officer in the King’s Own, eh, Colonel? So you live in Adua? In fine\nquarters in the Agriont, among the rich and well groomed?” West frowned,\nand Lorsen chuckled at him. “Which of us has truly avoided the\nresponsibility, as you put it? My conscience has never been cleaner. Hate us\nif you like, we’re used to it. No one likes to shake hands with the man who\nempties the latrine pits either, but pits have to be emptied all the same.\nOtherwise the world fills up with shit. You can have your dozen smiths, but\ndon’t try to take the high ground with me. There is no high ground here.”\nWest didn’t like it, but he had to admit the man made a good case, so he\nset his jaw and struggled on in silence, head down. They squelched towards\na long, windowless stone-built shed, thick smoke roiling up into the misty\nair from tall chimneys at each corner. The Practical slid back the bolt on the\nheavy door and heaved it open, and West followed him and Lorsen into the\ndarkness.\nThe heat was like a slap in the face after the freezing air outside. Acrid\nsmoke stung at West’s eyes, nipped at his throat. The din in the narrow\nspace was frightening. Bellows creaked and wheezed, hammers clanged on\nanvils, sending up showers of angry sparks, red-hot metal hissed furiously\nin water barrels. There were men everywhere, packed in tight together,\nsweating, and groaning, and coughing, hollow faces half lit by the orange\nglow from the forges. Devils, in hell.\n“Stop your work!” roared Lorsen. “Stop and form up!”\nThe men slowly set down their tools, lurched and stumbled and rattled\nforward to form a line while four or five Practicals looked on from the\nshadows. A shabby, broken, stooping, sorrowful line. A couple of the men\nhad irons on their wrists as well as their ankles. They scarcely looked like\nthe answer to all of West’s problems, but he had no choice. This was all\nthere was.\n“We have a visitor, from outside. Say your piece, Colonel.”\n“My name is Colonel West,” he croaked, voice cracking on the stinging\nair. “There are ten thousand soldiers camped a dozen miles down the road,\nunder Crown Prince Ladisla. We have need of smiths.” West cleared his\nthroat, tried to speak louder without coughing his lungs out. “Who among\nyou can work metals?”\nNo one spoke.

The men stared at their threadbare shoes or their bare\nfeet, with the odd sidelong glance at the glowering Practicals.\n“You need not be afraid. Who can work metals?”\n“I can, sir.” A man stepped forward from the line, the irons on his ankles\nrattling. He was lean and sinewy, slightly stooped. As the lamplight fell\nacross his head, West found himself wincing. He was disfigured by hideous\nburns. One side of his face was a mass of livid, slightly melted-looking\nscars, no eyebrow, scalp patchy with pink bald spots. The other side was\nlittle better. The man scarcely had a face at all. “I can work a forge, and I\ndid some soldiering too, in Gurkhul.”\n“Good,” muttered West, doing his best to swallow his horror at the\nman’s appearance. “Your name?”\n“Pike.”\n“Are any of these others good with metal, Pike?”\nThe burned man shuffled and clanked his way down the line, pulling\nmen forward by their shoulders while the commandant looked on, his frown\ngrowing deeper with every passing moment.\nWest licked his dry lips. Hard to believe that in so little time he could\nhave gone from so horribly cold to so horribly hot, but here he was, more\nuncomfortable than ever. “I’ll need keys to their irons, Inquisitor.”\n“There are no keys. The irons are melted shut. They are not intended\never to be removed and I would strongly advise you not to. Many of these\nprisoners are extremely dangerous, and you should bear in mind that you\nwill be returning them to us as soon as you can make alternative\narrangements. The Inquisition is not in the business of early releases.” He\nstalked off to speak to one of the Practicals.\nPike sidled up, pulling another convict by the elbow. “Pardon me, sir,”\nhe murmured, growling voice kept low. “But could you find a place for my\ndaughter?”\nWest shrugged his shoulders, uncomfortable. He would have liked to\ntake everyone and burn the damn place to the ground, but he was already\npushing his luck. “It’s not a good idea, a woman in amongst all those\nsoldiers. Not a good idea at all.”\n“A better idea than staying here, sir. I can’t leave her on her own. She\ncan help me at the forge. She can swing a hammer herself if it comes to\nthat. She’s strong.”\nShe didn’t look strong. She looked skinny and ragged, bony face\nsmeared with soot and grease. West could have taken her for a boy. “I’m\nsorry, Pike, but it’s no easy ride where we’re going.”\nShe grabbed hold of West’s arm as he turned away. “It’s no easy ride\nhere.” Her voice was a surprise. Soft, smooth, educated. “Cathil is my\nname. I can work.” West looked down at her, ready to shake his arm free,\nbut her expression reminded him of something. Painless. Fearless. Empty\neyes, flat, like a corpse.\nArdee. Blood smeared across her cheek."

He had to get out of this\nhorrible place.\nHe looked away, his eyes stinging. “Her too,” he barked.\nLorsen snorted. “Are you joking, Colonel?”\n“Believe me, I’m not in a joking mood.”\n“Skilled men is one thing.

Very well. I cannot stop you.” He\nleaned in a little closer. “But the Arch Lector will hear about this.

Something to be smiled out at through the wet window while one\nsat, warm and dry in one’s quarters. Something that took the young ladies in\nthe park by surprise and made them squeal, sticking their dresses excitingly\nto their clammy skin. Something to be dashed through, laughing with one’s\nfriends, as one made one’s way from tavern to tavern, before drying out\nbefore a roaring fire with a mug of hot spiced wine. Jezal used to enjoy the\nrain almost as much as the sun.\nBut that was before.\nOut here on the plains, storms were of a different stamp.

This was a cold and\nmurderous, merciless and grudge-bearing, bitter and relentless fury of a\nstorm, and somehow it made all the difference that the nearest roof, let\nalone the nearest tavern, was hundreds of miles behind them. The rain came\ndown in sheets, dousing the endless plain and everything on it with icy\nwater. The fat drops stung at Jezal’s scalp like sling-stones, nipped at his\nexposed hands, the tops of his ears, the back of his neck.

It had certainly cost him enough, and he had looked very well\nin it in the shop, quite the rugged outdoorsman, but the seams had begun to\nleak almost as soon as the first drops fell. For some hours now he had been\nevery bit as wet as if he had climbed into the bath with his clothes on, and a\ngood deal colder.\nHis boots were full of icy water, his thighs were chafed ragged against\nhis wet trousers, the waterlogged saddle creaked and squelched with every\nmovement of his unhappy horse. His nose was running, his nostrils and his\nlips were sore, the very reins were painful in his wet palms. His nipples in\nparticular were two points of agony in a sea of discomfort. The whole\nbusiness was utterly unbearable.\n“When will it end?” he muttered bitterly to himself, hunching his\nshoulders and looking up beseechingly at the gloomy heavens, the rain\npattering on his face, in his mouth, in his eyes. Happiness seemed at that\nmoment to consist of nothing more than a dry shirt. “Can’t you do\nsomething?” he moaned at Bayaz.\n“Like what?” the Magus snapped back at him, water coursing down his\nface and dripping from his bedraggled beard. “You think that I’m enjoying\nthis? Out on the great plain in a bastard of a storm at my age? The skies\nmake no special dispensation for Magi, boy, they piss on everyone the\nsame. I suggest you adjust to it and keep your whining to yourself. A great\nleader must share the hardships of his followers, of his soldiers, of his\nsubjects. That is how he wins their respect. Great leaders do not complain.\nNot ever.”\n“Fuck them then,” muttered Jezal under his breath. “And this rain, too!”\n“You call this rain?” Ninefingers rode past him, a big smile spread\nacross his ugly lump of a face. Not long after the drops began to come\ndown hard, Jezal had been most surprised to see the Northman shrug off\nfirst his battered coat, and then his shirt, roll them up in an oilskin and ride\non stripped to the waist, heedless of the water running down his great slab\nof scarred back, happy as a great hog wallowing in the mud.\nSuch behaviour had, at first, struck Jezal as another unforgivable display\nof savagery, and he had only thanked his stars that the primitive had\ndeigned to keep his trousers on, but as the cold rain began to seep through\nhis coat he had become less sure.

He remembered it all with a\npainful clarity. The bruise on her face, the colour of her eyes, the set of her\nmouth, one side twisted up. Just thinking of it made him have to swallow\nthat familiar lump in his throat. The lump he swallowed twenty times a day.\nFirst thing in the morning, when he woke, and last thing at night, as he lay\non the hard ground. To be back with Ardee now, safe and warm, seemed\nlike the realisation of all his dreams.\nHe wondered how long she might wait, as the weeks dragged on, and\nshe received no word. Might she even now be writing daily letters to\nAngland that he would never receive? Letters expressing her tender\nfeelings. Letters desperately seeking news. Letters begging for replies. Now\nher worst expectations would all be confirmed. That he was a faithless ass,\nand a liar, and had forgotten all about her, when nothing could have been\nfurther from the truth. He ground his teeth in frustration and despair at the\nthought, but what could he do? Replies were hard to send from a blighted,\nblasted, ruined wasteland, even supposing he could have written one in this\nepic downpour. He inwardly cursed the names of Bayaz and Ninefingers, of\nLongfoot and Quai. He cursed the Old Empire and he cursed the endless\nplain. He cursed the whole demented expedition. It was becoming an hourly\nritual.\nJezal began to perceive, dimly, that he had until now had rather an easy\nlife. It seemed strange that he had moaned so long and hard about rising\nearly to fence, or about lowering himself to play cards with Lieutenant\nBrint, or about how his sausages were always a touch overdone of a\nmorning. He should have been laughing, bright-eyed and with a spring in\nhis step, simply to have been out of the rain. He coughed, and sniffed, and\nwiped at his sore nose with his sore hand. At least with so much water\naround, no one would notice him weeping.\nOnly Ferro looked as if she was enjoying herself even less than him,\noccasionally glaring at the pissing clouds, her face wrinkled up with hatred\nand horror. Her spiky hair was plastered flat to her skull, her waterlogged\nclothes hung limp from her scrawny shoulders, water ran down her scarred\nface and dripped from the end of her sharp nose, the point of her sharp chin.\nShe looked like a mean-tempered cat dunked unexpectedly in a pond, its\nbody suddenly seeming a quarter of the size it had been, stripped of all its\nair of menace. Perhaps a woman’s voice might be the thing to lift him from\nthis state of mind, and Ferro was the nearest thing to a woman within a\nhundred miles."

Perhaps a woman’s voice might be the thing to lift him from\nthis state of mind, and Ferro was the nearest thing to a woman within a\nhundred miles.\nHe spurred his horse up alongside her, doing his best to smile, and she\nturned her scowl on him. Jezal found to his discomfort that at close\nquarters, much of the menace returned. He had forgotten about those eyes.\nYellow eyes, sharp as knives, pupils small as pinpricks, strange and\ndisconcerting. He wished he had never approached her now, but he could\nhardly go without saying something.\n“Bet it doesn’t rain much where you come from, eh?”\n“Are you going to shut your fucking hole, or do I have to hurt you?”\nJezal cleared his throat, and quietly allowed his mount to drop back\naway from her. “Crazy bitch,” he whispered under his breath. Damn her,\nthen, she could keep her misery. He wasn’t about to start wallowing in self-\npity. That wasn’t his way at all.\nT\nhe rain had finally stopped when they came upon the place, but the air\nwas still full of heavy damp, the sky above was still full of strange colours.\nThe evening sun pierced the swirling clouds with pink and orange, casting\nan eerie glow over the grey plain.\nTwo empty carts stood upright, another was tipped up on its side, one\nwheel broken off, a dead horse still tethered to it, lying with its pink tongue\nlolling out of its mouth, a pair of broken arrows sticking from its bloody\nside. The corpses were scattered all around in the flattened grass, like dolls\ndiscarded by a bad-tempered child. Some had deep wounds, or limbs\nbroken, or arrows poking from their bodies. One had an arm off at the\nshoulder, a short length of snapped bone sticking out as if from a butcher’s\njoint.\nRubbish was scattered all around them. Broken weapons, splintered\nwood. A few trunks smashed open, rolls of cloth ripped out and slashed\nacross the wet ground. Burst barrels, shattered boxes, rooted through and\nlooted.\n“Merchants,” grunted Ninefingers, looking down. “Like we’re\npretending to be. Life’s cheap out here alright.”\nFerro curled her lip. “Where isn’t it?”\nThe wind whipped cold across the plain, cutting clean through Jezal’s\ndamp clothes. He had never seen a corpse before, and here were laid out…\nhow many? At least a dozen. He started to feel slightly peculiar halfway\nthrough counting them.\nNo one else seemed much moved, though familiarity with violence was\nhardly surprising among these characters. Ferro was crawling around the\nbodies, peering down and prodding them with as little emotion as an\nundertaker. Ninefingers looked as though he had seen far worse, which\nJezal did not doubt he had, and done far worse besides. Bayaz and Longfoot\nboth looked mildly troubled, but not much more so than if they had come\nupon some unknown horse tracks. Quai scarcely even looked interested.\nJezal could have done with a share of their indifference at that moment.\nHe would not have admitted it, but he was feeling more than a little sick.\nThat skin: slack, and still, and waxy pale, beaded with wet from the rain."

Those wounds. Ragged red lines, blue-and-black bruises, rips and\ntears and gaping mouths in flesh.\nJezal turned suddenly in his saddle, looking behind, to the left, to the\nright, but every view was the same. Nowhere to run to, if he had even\nknown in what direction the nearest settlement lay. In a group of six and yet\nhe felt utterly alone. In a vast, open space, and yet he felt utterly trapped.\nOne of the corpses seemed to be staring, unnervingly, straight at him. A\nyoung man, no more than Jezal’s age, with sandy hair and protruding ears.\nHe could have done with a shave, except, of course, that it hardly mattered\nnow. There was a yawning red gash across his belly, his bloody hands lying\non either side of it, as though trying to squeeze it shut. His guts glistened\nwetly inside, all purple red. Jezal felt his gorge rising. He was already\nfeeling faint from eating too little that morning. Damn sick of dry biscuit,\nand he could hardly force down the slops the others put together. He turned\naway from the sickening scene and stared down at the grass, pretending to\nbe searching for important clues while his stomach clenched and heaved.\nHe gripped his reins as tightly as he could, forcing down the spit as it\nrushed into his mouth. He was a proud son of the Union, damn it. What was\nmore he was a nobleman, of a distinguished family. What was still more he\nwas a bold officer of the King’s Own, and a winner of the Contest. To vomit\nat the sight of a little gore would be to disgrace himself before this mixture\nof fools and primitives, and that could under no circumstances be permitted.\nThe honour of his nation was at stake. He glared fixedly at the wet ground,\nand he clamped his teeth shut, and he ordered his stomach to be still.\nGradually, it began to work. He sucked in deep breaths through his nose.\nCool, damp, calming air. He was in complete control. He looked back at the\nothers.\nFerro was squatting on the ground with her hand in one of the victim’s\ngaping wounds as far almost as her wrist. “Cold,” she snapped at\nNinefingers, “been dead since this morning at least.” She pulled her hand\nout, fingers slimy with gore.\nJezal had belched half his meagre breakfast down his coat before he had\ntime even to slide out of his saddle. He staggered a couple of drunkard’s\nsteps, took a gasping breath, and retched again. He bent over, hands on his\nknees, head spinning, spitting bile out onto the grass.\n“You alright?”\nJezal glanced up, doing his best to look nonchalant with a long string of\nbitter drool hanging from his face. “Something I ate,” he muttered, wiping\nat his nose and mouth with his trembling hand. A pitiful ruse, he had to\nadmit."

A pitiful ruse, he had to\nadmit.\nNinefingers only nodded, though. “That meat this morning, most likely.\nI been feeling sick myself.” He gave one of his revolting smiles and offered\nJezal a water-skin. “Best keep drinking. Flush it away, uh?”\nJezal sloshed a mouthful of water round his mouth and spat it out,\nwatching Ninefingers walk back to the bodies, and frowning. That had been\nstrange. Coming from another source it might have seemed almost a\ngenerous gesture. He took another swig of water, and began to feel better.\nHe made, somewhat unsteadily, for his horse, and clambered back into the\nsaddle.\n“Whoever did it was well armed, and in numbers,” Ferro was saying.\n“The grass is full of tracks.”\n“We should be careful,” said Jezal, hoping to impose himself on the\nconversation.\nBayaz turned sharply to look at him. “We should always be careful! That\ngoes without saying! How far are we from Darmium?”\nLongfoot squinted up at the sky, then out across the plain. He licked his\nfinger and held it up to the wind. “Even for a man of my talents, it is hard to\nbe accurate without the stars. Fifty miles or thereabouts.”\n“We’ll need to turn off the track soon.”\n“We are not crossing the river at Darmium?”\n“The city is in chaos. Cabrian holds it, and admits no one. We cannot\ntake the risk.”\n“Very well. Aostum it is. We will take a wide route round Darmium and\noff westwards. A slightly longer path but—”\n“No.”\n“No?”\n“The bridge at Aostum lies in ruins.”\nLongfoot frowned. “Gone, eh? Truly, God loves to test his faithful. We\nmay have to ford the Aos then—”\n“No,” said Bayaz. “The rains have been heavy and the great river is\ndeep. The fords are all closed to us.”\nThe Navigator looked puzzled. “You, of course, are my employer, and as\na proud member of the order of Navigators I will always do my utmost to\nobey, but I am afraid that I can see no other way. If we cannot cross at\nDarmium, or at Aostum, and we cannot ford the river…”\n“There is one other bridge.”\n“There is?” Longfoot looked baffled for a moment, then his eyes\nsuddenly widened. “You cannot mean—”\n“The bridge at Aulcus still stands.”\nEveryone glanced at each other for a moment, frowning. “I thought you\nsaid the place was a ruin,” said Ninefingers.\n“A shattered graveyard, I heard,” murmured Ferro.\n“I thought you said no one goes within miles of the place.”\n“It would hardly have been my first choice, but there are no others. We\nwill join the river and follow the northern bank to Aulcus.” Nobody moved.\nLongfoot in particular had a look of stunned horror on his face. “Now!”\nsnapped Bayaz. “It is plainly not safe to remain here.” And with that he"

Quai shrugged and flicked his reins\nand the cart grumbled off through the grass after the First of the Magi.\nLongfoot and Ninefingers followed behind, all frowns and foreboding.\nJezal stared at the bodies, still lying where they had found them, their\neyes staring accusingly up into the darkening sky. “Shouldn’t we bury\nthem?”\n“If you like,” grunted Ferro, springing up into the saddle in one easy\nmotion. “Maybe you could bury them in puke.”\nBloody Company\nR\niding, that was what they were doing. That was what they’d been doing\nfor days. Riding, looking for Bethod, with winter coming on. Bog and\nforest, hill and valley. Rain and sleet, fog and snow. Looking for signs that\nhe was coming their way, and knowing that there wouldn’t be any. A lot of\nwasted time, to the Dogman’s mind, but once you’ve been fool enough to\nask for a task, you better do the one you’re given.\n“Stupid bloody job, this,” snarled Dow, wincing and twitching and\nfussing with his reins. He’d never been too much of a one for horseback.\nLiked to keep his feet on the ground and pointed at the enemy. “Waste of\nour fucking time. How d’you put up with scouting, Dogman? Stupid bloody\njob!”\n“Someone’s got to get it done, don’t they? Least I got a horse now.”\n“Well, I’m right delighted for you!” he sneered. “You got a horse!”\nThe Dogman shrugged his shoulders. “Better than walking.”\n“Better than walking, eh?” scoffed Dow. “That just binds it all up!”\n“I got new breeches and all. Not to mention good woollens. The wind\ndon’t blow half so cold round my fruits no more.”\nThat got a chuckle from Tul, but it seemed Dow wasn’t in a laughing\nmood. “Wind round your fruits? By the fucking dead, boy, is this what\nwe’re come to? You forgotten who you are? You was Ninefingers’ closest!\nYou came over the mountains with him in the first place! You’re in all them\nsongs along with him! You scouted at the head of armies. A thousand men,\nall following your say-so!”\n“That didn’t turn out too happy for anyone concerned,” muttered\nDogman, but Dow was already laying into Tul.\n“And how about you, big man? Tul Duru Thunderhead, strongest bastard\nin the North. Wrestled bears and won, I heard. Held the pass all alone, while\nyour clan got clean away. A giant, they say, ten feet tall, born under a storm,\nand with a belly full o’ thunder. What about it, giant? The only thunder I’ve\nheard you make lately is when you take a shit!”\n“What of it?” snarled Tul. “You any different? Men used to whisper your\nname, scared to speak it out loud.

Times have changed, and you rolled just as far downhill as the rest of\nus!”\nDow only smiled. “That’s my point, big lad, that’s just my point. We\nused to be something, each one of us. Named Men. Known men. Feared\nmen. I remember my brother telling me that there ain’t no better man than\nHarding Grim with bow nor blade, no better man in all the North. Steadiest\ndamn hand in the whole Circle of the World! How about that, eh, Grim?”\n“Uh,” said Grim.\nDow nodded his head. “Exactly what I’m saying. Now look at us. We\nain’t so much rolled downhill as fell off a bloody cliff! Running errands for\nthese Southerners? These fucking women in men’s trousers? These damn\nsalad-eaters with their big words and their thin little swords?”\nDogman shifted in his saddle, uncomfortable. “That West knows what\nhe’s about.”\n“That West!” sneered Dow. “He knows his arse from his mouth, and in\nthat he’s a damn stretch better than the rest, but he’s soft as pig fat, and you\nknow it. Got no bones in him at all! None of ’em have! I’d be shocked to\nmy roots if the better part of ’em have ever seen a skirmish. You reckon\nthey’d stand a charge from Bethod’s Carls?” He snorted hard laughter to\nhimself. “Now there’s a joke!”\n“It can’t be denied they’re a piss-weak crowd,” muttered Tul, and the\nDogman couldn’t very well disagree. “Half of ’em are too hungry to lift a\nweapon, let alone swing one with some fire, if they could even work out\nhow. All the good ones went north to fight Bethod, leaving us here with the\nscrapings from the pot.”\n“Scrapings from a piss-pot, I’m thinking. What about you, Threetrees?”\ncalled Dow. “The Rock of Uffrith, eh? You were the spike up Bethod’s arse\nfor six months, a hero to every right-thinking man in the North! Rudd\nThreetrees! There’s a man carved out of stone! There’s a man who never\nbacks down! You want honour? You want dignity? You want to know what\na man should be? Look no fucking further! What do you make of all this,\neh? Running errands! Checking these bogs for Bethod where we all know\nhe ain’t! Work fit for boys and we’re lucky to get it, I suppose?”\nThreetrees pulled up his horse and turned it slowly round. He sat in his\nsaddle, hunched up, tired-looking, and he stared at Dow for a minute.\n“Open your ears and listen for once,” he said, “…’cause I don’t want to be\ntelling you this every mile we go.

You can harp on the past all you\nplease, Dow, like some old woman upset ’cause her tits used to stay up by\nthemselves, or you can shut your fucking hole and help me get on with\nthings.”\nHe gave each one of ’em a look in the eye, and the Dogman felt a touch\nshamed for doubting him. “As for checking for Bethod where he ain’t, well,\nBethod’s never been one to turn up where he’s supposed to be. Scouting’s\nthe task we’ve been given, and scouting’s the task I mean to get done.” He\nleaned forward in his saddle. “So how’s this for a fucking formula? Mouth\nshut. Eyes open.” And he turned and nudged his horse on through the trees.\nDow took a deep breath. “Fair enough, chief, fair enough. It’s just a\nshame is all. That’s what I’m saying. Just a shame.”\nT\nhere’s three of ’em,” said Dogman. “Northmen, for certain, but hard to\ntell their clan. Being as they’re down here, I’m guessing they follow\nBethod.”\n“More ’n likely,” said Tul. “Seems that’s the fashion these days.”\n“Just three?” asked Threetrees. “No reason for Bethod to have three men\non their own all the way out here. Must be more nearby.”\n“Let’s deal with the three,” growled Dow, “and get to the rest later. I\ncame here to fight.”\n“You came here ’cause I dragged you here,” snapped Threetrees. “You\nwas all for turning back an hour ago.”\n“Uh,” said Grim.\n“We can get around ’em if we need to.” Dogman pointed through the\ncold woods. “They’re up on the slope there, in the trees. No trouble to get\naround ’em.”\nThreetrees looked up at the sky, pink and grey through the branches, and\nshook his head. “No. We’re losing the light, and I wouldn’t like leaving ’em\nbehind us in the dark. Since we’re here, and since they’re here, we’d best\ndeal with ’em. Weapons it is.” He squatted down, talking quiet. “Here’s\nhow we’ll do it. Dogman, get round and above, up on that slope there. Take\nthe one on the left when you hear the signal. You follow me? The one on the\nleft. And best not to miss.”\n“Aye,” said Dogman, “on the left.” Not missing more or less went\nwithout saying.\n“Dow, you slide in quiet and take the middle.”\n“The middle,” growled Dow. “He’s done.”\n“That leaves one for you, Grim.” Grim nodded without looking up,"

I don’t want to be\nputting one o’ you in the mud over this. Places, then.”\nThe Dogman found a good spot up above Bethod’s three scouts and\nwatched from behind a tree trunk. Seemed like he’d done this a hundred\ntimes, but it never got any easier on the nerves. Probably just as well. It’s\nwhen it gets easy that a man makes mistakes.\nDogman was watching for him, so he just caught sight of Dow in the\nfading light, slithering up through the brush, eyes fixed ahead on his task.\nHe was getting close now, real close. Dogman nocked an arrow and took an\naim at the one on the left, breathing slow to keep his hands steady. It was\nthen that he realised. Now he was on the other side, the one that had been\non the left was on the right. So which one should he shoot?\nHe cursed to himself, struggling to remember what Threetrees said. Get\naround and take the one on the left. Worst thing of all would have been to\ndo nothing, so he aimed up at the one on his left and hoped for the best.\nHe heard Threetrees call from down below, sounding like a bird out in\nthe woods. Dow gathered himself to jump. Dogman let his arrow fly. It\nthudded into the back of his task just as Grim’s arrow stuck him in the front,\nand Dow seized hold of the middle one and stabbed him from behind. That\nleft one of ’em untouched, and very surprised-looking.\n“Shit,” whispered the Dogman.\n“Help!” screamed the last of ’em, before Dow jumped on him. They\nrolled in the leaves, grunting and thrashing. Dow’s arm went up and down\n—once, twice, three times, then he stood up, glaring through the trees and\nlooking mighty annoyed. Dogman was just shrugging his shoulders when\nhe heard a voice behind him.\n“What?”\nDogman froze, cold all over. Another one, out in the bushes, not ten\nstrides away. He reached for an arrow and nocked it, real quiet, then turned\nslowly round. He saw two of ’em, and they saw him, and his mouth went\nsour as old beer. They all stared. Dogman aimed at the bigger one and\npulled the string right back.\n“No!” he shouted. The arrow thudded into his chest and he groaned and\nstumbled, fell down on his knees. Dogman dropped his bow and made a\nsnatch at his knife, but he hadn’t got it drawn before the other one was on\nhim. They went down hard in the brush, and started rolling.\nLight, dark, light, dark. Over and over they went, down the slope,\nkicking and tearing and punching at each other. Dogman’s head smacked\nagainst something and he was down on his back, wrestling with this\nbastard. They hissed at each other, not words exactly, sounds like dogs\nmake fighting. The man pulled his hand free and got a blade out from\nsomewhere and Dogman caught his wrist before he could stab it home."

The Dogman’s\nshoulders, his arms, his hands were burning, running out of strength.\nStaring at his face. Stubble on his chin, yellow teeth, pock marks on his\nbent nose, hair hanging down around it. The point of the blade nudged\ncloser. Dogman was dead, and there was no help for it.\nSnick.\nAnd his head wasn’t there anymore. Blood washed over Dogman’s face,\nhot and sticky and reeking. The corpse went slack and he shoved it away,\nblood in his eyes, blood up his nose, blood in his mouth. He staggered up,\ngasping and choking and spitting.\n“Alright, Dogman. You’re alright.” Tul. Must’ve come up on them while\nthey were struggling.\n“I’m still alive,” Dogman whispered, the way Logen used to when a\nfight was done. “Still alive.” By the dead, though, that had been a close\nthing.\n“They ain’t got too much in the way of gear,” Dow was saying, poking\nround the campsite. Cookpot on the fire, weapons, and such like, but not\nmuch food. Not enough to be all alone out there in the woods.\n“Scouts maybe,” said Threetrees. “Outriders for some bigger band?”\n“Reckon they must be,” said Dow.\nThreetrees slapped his hand down on the Dogman’s shoulder. “You\nalright?”\nHe was still busy trying to rub the blood off his face. “Aye, I think so.”\nBit shaky still, but that would settle. “Cuts and scrapes, I reckon. Nothing\nI’ll die of.”\n“Good, ’cause I can’t spare you. Why don’t you take a creep up through\nthem trees and have a look-see, while we clear up this mess here?

What do you say now?”\n“Could be I made a mistake.”\n“A big one,” said the Dogman.\nThere were a hundred fires burning down there on the dark slopes, a\nhundred fires and more. There were men down there too, it hardly needed\nsaying. Thralls mostly, lightly armed, but plenty of Carls as well.

He knows all the\nways, they say.”\n“Whose signs are they then?” asked Dogman.\n“Don’t know, could be some boys from out east, past the Crinna. There’s\nsome strange folk out that way. You know any o’ them banners, Grim?”\n“Aye,” said Grim, but that was all he said.\n“Don’t hardly matter whose signs they are,” muttered Dow, “just look at\nthe numbers of ’em. There’s half the fucking North down there.”\n“And the worst half,” said Dogman. He was looking at Bethod’s sign,\nset up in the middle of the host. A red circle daubed on black hides, an acre\nof ’em, it looked like, big as a field, mounted on a tall pine trunk, flapping\nevil in the wind. Huge great thing. “Wouldn’t fancy carrying it,” he\nmuttered.\nDow slithered over and leaned in close. “Might be that we could sneak\nin there in the dark,” he whispered. “Might be we could sneak in and put a\nblade in Bethod.”\nThey all looked at each other. It was a terrible risk, but Dogman had no\ndoubts it was worth the trying. Wasn’t a one of them hadn’t dreamed of\nsending Bethod back to the mud.\n“Put a blade in him, the bastard,” muttered Tul, and he had a smile right\nacross his face.\n“Uh,” grunted Grim."

Work for Named Men like them, or like they used to be, maybe.\nThere’d be some songs about that, alright. Dogman’s blood was rushing at\nthe thought, skin prickling on his hands, but Threetrees was having none of\nit.\n“No. We can’t risk it. We got to go back and tell the Union. Tell ’em\nthey got guests coming. Bad guests, and in numbers.” He tugged at his\nbeard, and Dogman could tell he didn’t like it, backing off. None of ’em\ndid, but they knew he was right, even Dow. Chances were they’d never get\nto Bethod, and if they did they’d never get out.\n“We got to go back,” said Dogman.\n“Fair enough,” said Dow. “We go back. Shame though.”\n“Aye,” said Threetrees. “Shame.”\nLong Shadows\nB\ny the dead.” Ferro said nothing, but for the first time since Logen met\nher, the scowl had slipped off. Her face was slack, mouth hanging slightly\nopen. Luthar, on the other hand, was grinning like a fool.\n“You ever see anything like that?” he shouted over the noise, pointing\nout at it with a trembling hand.\n“There is nothing else like that,” said Bayaz.\nLogen had to admit that he’d been wondering what all the fuss was\nabout when it came to crossing a river. Some of the bigger ones in the North\ncould be a problem, especially in the wrong season and with a lot of gear to\ncarry. But if there was no bridge, you found a good ford, held your weapons\nover your head, and sloshed across. Might take a while for your boots to dry\nout, and you had to keep your eyes well opened for an ambush, but\notherwise there was nothing much to fear from a river. Good place to fill\nyour water-skin.\nFilling your skin at the Aos would have been a dangerous business, at\nleast without a hundred strides of rope.\nLogen had once stood on the cliffs near Uffrith, and watched the waves\ncrash against the rocks far below, the sea stretching away, grey and foaming\nout of sight. A dizzying, and a humbling, and a worrying place to stand. The\nfeeling at the brink of the great river’s canyon was much the same, except\nthat a quarter mile away or so another cliff rose up from the water. The far\nbank, if you could use the word about a towering rock face.\nHe shuffled up gingerly to the very edge, prodding at the soft ground\nwith the toes of his boots, and peered over the brink. Not a good idea. The\nred earth overhung slightly, bound up with white grass roots, and then the\njagged rocks dropped away, almost sheer. Where the frothing water slapped\nagainst them, far below, it sent great plumes of bright spray into the air,\nclouds of damp mist that Logen could almost feel on his face. Tufts of long"

Tufts of long\ngrass clung to the cracks and the ledges, and birds flitted between them,\nhundreds of small white birds. Logen could just make out their twittering\ncalls over the mighty rumble of the river.\nHe thought on being dropped into that thundering weight of dark water\n—sucked, and whirled, and ripped around like a leaf in the storm. He\nswallowed, and shuffled cautiously back from the edge, looking around for\nsomething to cling on to. He felt tiny, and weightless, as if a strong gust of\nwind might snatch him away. He could almost feel the water moving\nthrough his boots, the surging, rolling, unstoppable power of it, making the\nvery earth tremble.\n“So you can see why a bridge might be such a good idea!” shouted\nBayaz in his ear.\n“How can you even build a bridge across that?”\n“At Aostum the river splits in three, and the canyon is much less deep.\nThe Emperor’s architects built islands, and made their bridges of many\nsmall arches. Even so, it took them twelve years to build. The bridge at\nDarmium is the work of Kanedias himself, a gift to his brother Juvens when\nthey were yet on good terms. It crosses the river in a single span. How he\ndid it, none now can say.” Bayaz turned for the horses. “Get the others, we\nshould keep moving!”\nFerro was already walking back from the brink. “So much rain.” She\nlooked over her shoulder, frowned and shook her head.\n“Don’t get rivers like that where you come from, eh?”\n“Out in the Badlands, water is the most precious thing you can have.\nMen kill over a bottle of it.”\n“That’s where you were born? The Badlands?” A strange name for a\nplace, but it sounded about right for her.\n“There are no births in the Badlands, pink. Only deaths.”\n“Harsh land, eh? Where were you born, then?”\nShe scowled. “What do you care?”\n“Just trying to be friendly.”\n“Friends!” she sneered, brushing past him towards the horses.\n“Why? You got so many out here you couldn’t use another?”\nShe stopped, half turned, and looked at him through narrowed eyes. “My\nfriends don’t last, pink.”\n“Nor do mine, but I reckon I’ll take the risk if you will.”\n“Alright,” she said, but there was nothing friendly in her face. “The\nGurkish conquered my home when I was a child, and they took me for a\nslave. They took all the children.”\n“A slave?”\n“Yes, fool, a slave! Bought and sold like meat by the butcher! Owned by\nsomeone else, and they do as they please with you, like they would with a\ngoat, or a dog, or the dirt in their gardens! That what you want to know,\nfriend?”\nLogen frowned. “We don’t have that custom in the North.”\n“Ssss,” she hissed, lip curling with scorn. “Good for fucking you!”\nT\nhe ruin loomed over them.

A forest of shattered pillars, a maze of broken\nwalls, the ground around it strewn with fallen blocks as long as a man was\ntall. Crumbling windows and empty doorways yawned like wounds. A\nragged black outline, chopped out from the flying clouds like a giant row of\nbroken teeth.\n“What city was this?” asked Luthar.\n“No city,” said Bayaz. “At the height of the Old Time, at the greatest\nextent of the Emperor’s power, this was his winter palace.”\n“All this?” Logen squinted at the sprawling wreck. “One man’s house?”\n“And not even the whole year round. Most of the time, the court would\nstay in Aulcus. In winter, when the cold snows swept down off the\nmountains, the Emperor would bring his retinue here. An army of\nguardsmen, of servants, of cooks, of officials, of princes, and children, and\nwives, making their way across the plain ahead of the cold winds, taking up\nresidence here for three short months in the echoing halls, the beautiful\ngardens, the gilded chambers.” Bayaz shook his bald head. “In times long\npast, before the war, this place glittered like the sea beneath the rising sun.”\nLuthar sniffed. “So Glustrod tore it down, I suppose?”\n“No. It was not in that war, but another that it fell, many years later. A\nwar fought by my order, after the death of Juvens, against his eldest\nbrother.”\n“Kanedias,” muttered Quai, “the Master Maker.”\n“A war just as bitter, just as brutal, just as merciless as the one before.\nAnd even more was lost. Juvens and Kanedias both, in the end.”\n“Not a happy family,” muttered Logen.\n“No.” Bayaz frowned up at the mighty wreckage. “With the death of the\nMaker, the last of the four sons of Euz, the Old Time ended. We are left\nonly with the ruins, and the tombs, and the myths. Little men, kneeling in\nthe long shadows of the past.”\nFerro stood up in her stirrups. “There are riders,” she barked, staring off\nat the horizon. “Forty or more.”\n“Where?” snapped Bayaz, shading his eyes. “I don’t see anything.” Nor\ncould Logen. Only the waving grass and the towering clouds.\nLongfoot frowned. “I see no riders, and I am blessed with perfect vision.\nWhy, I have often been told that—”\n“You want to wait until you see them,” hissed Ferro, “or get off the road\nbefore they see us?”\n“We’ll head into the ruins,” snapped Bayaz over his shoulder. “And wait\nfor them to pass. Malacus! Turn the cart!”\nThe wreck of the winter palace was full of shadows, and stillness, and\ndecay. The outsize ruins towered around them, all covered with old ivy and\nwet moss, streaked and crusted with the droppings of bird and bat. The\nanimals had made the place their palace now.

Spiders had spun great glistening webs\nin leaning doorways, heavy with sparkling beads of dew. Tiny lizards\nsunned themselves in patches of light on the fallen blocks, swarming away\nas they came near. The rattling of the cart over the broken ground, the\nfootfalls and the hoofbeats echoed back from the slimy stones. Everywhere\nwater dripped, and ran, and plopped in hidden pools.\n“Take this, pink.” Ferro slapped her sword into Logen’s hands.\n“Where are you going?”\n“You wait down here, and stay out of sight.” She jerked her head\nupwards. “I’ll watch them from up there.”\nAs a boy, Logen had never been out of the trees round the village. As a\nyoung man he’d spent days in the High Places, testing himself against the\nmountains. At Heonan in the winter, the hillmen had held the high pass.\nEven Bethod had thought that there was no way round, but Logen had\nfound a way up the frozen cliff and settled that score. He could see no way\nup here, though. Not without an hour or two to spare. Cliffs of leaning\nblocks heavy with dead creeper, crags of tottering stonework slick with\nmoss, seeming to lean and tip as the clouds moved fast above.\n“How the hell you planning to get up…”\nShe was already halfway up one of the pillars. She didn’t so much climb\nas swarm like an insect, hand over hand. She paused at the top for a\nmoment, found a footing she liked, then sprang through the air, right over\nLogen’s head, landed on the wall behind and scrambled up onto it, sending\na shower of broken mortar down into his face. She squatted on the top and\nfrowned down at him. “Just try not to make too much noise!” she hissed,\nthen was gone.\n“Did you see…” muttered Logen, but the others had already moved\nfurther into the damp shadows, and he hurried after them, not wanting to be\nleft alone in this overgrown graveyard. Quai had pulled his cart up further\non, and was leaning against it beside the restless horses. The First of the\nMagi was kneeling near him in the weeds, rubbing at the lichen-crusted\nwall with his palms.\n“Look at this,” snapped Bayaz as Logen tried to edge past. “These\ncarvings here. Masterpieces of the ancient world! Stories, and lessons, and\nwarnings from history.” His thick fingers brushed gently at the scarred\nstone. “We might be the first men to look upon these in centuries!”\n“Mmm,” muttered Logen, puffing out his cheeks.\n“Look here!” Bayaz gestured at the wall. “Euz gives his gifts to his three\noldest sons, while Glustrod looks on from the shadows. The birth of the\nthree pure disciplines of magic. Some craftsmanship, eh?”\n“Right.”\n“And here,” grunted Bayaz, knocking some weeds away and shuffling\nalong to the next mossy panel, “Glustrod plans to destroy his brother’s\nwork.” He had to tear at a tangle of dead ivy to get at the one beyond. “He"

He hears voices from the world below, you see? He\nsummons devils and sends them against his enemies. And in this one,” he\nmuttered, tugging at the weight of brown creeper, “let me see now…”\n“Glustrod digs,” muttered Quai. “Who knows? In the next one he might\neven have found what he’s looking for.”\n“Hmm,” grumbled the First of the Magi, letting the ivy fall back across\nthe wall. He glowered at his apprentice as he stood up, frowning. “Perhaps,\nsometimes, the past is better left covered.”\nLogen cleared his throat and edged away, ducked quickly under a\nleaning archway. The wide space beyond was filled with small, knotty trees,\nplanted in rows, but long overgrown. Great weeds and nettles, brown and\nsagging rotten from the rain, stood almost waist high around the mossy\nwalls.\n“Perhaps I should not say it myself,” came Longfoot’s cheerful voice,\n“but it must be said! My talent for navigation stands alone! It rises above\nthe skills of every other Navigator as the mountain rises over the deep\nvalley!” Logen winced, but it was Bayaz’s anger or Longfoot’s bragging,\nand that was no choice at all.\n“I have led us across the great plain to the River Aos, without a\ndeviation of even a mile!” The Navigator beamed at Logen and Luthar, as\nthough expecting an avalanche of praise. “And without a single dangerous\nencounter, in a land reckoned among the most dangerous under the sun!”\nHe frowned. “Perhaps a quarter of our epic journey is now safely behind us.\nI am not sure that you appreciate the difficulty involved. Across the\nfeatureless plain, as autumn turns to winter, and without even the stars to\nreckon by!” He shook his head. “Huh. Truly, the pinnacle of achievement is\na lonely place.”\nHe turned away and wandered over to one of the trees. “The lodgings\nare a little past their best, but at least the fruit trees are still in working\norder.” Longfoot plucked a green apple from a low-hanging branch and\nbegan to shine it on his sleeve. “Nothing like a fine apple, and from the\nEmperor’s orchard, no less.” He grinned to himself. “Strange, eh? How the\nplants outlast the greatest works of men.”\nLuthar sat down on a fallen statue nearby, slid the longer of his two\nswords from its sheath, and laid it across his knees. Steel glinted mirror-\nbright as he turned it over in his lap, frowned at it, licked a finger, and\nscrubbed at some invisible blemish. He pulled out his whetstone, spat on it,\nand carefully set to work on the long, thin blade. The metal rang gently as\nthe stone moved back and forward. It was soothing, somehow, that sound,\nthat ritual, familiar from a thousand campfires of Logen’s past.\n“Must you?” asked Brother Longfoot. “Sharpening, polishing,"

It was soothing, somehow, that sound,\nthat ritual, familiar from a thousand campfires of Logen’s past.\n“Must you?” asked Brother Longfoot. “Sharpening, polishing,\nsharpening, polishing, morning and night, it makes my head hurt. It’s not as\nif you’ve even made any use of them yet. Probably find when you need\nthem that you’ve sharpened them away to nothing, eh?” He chuckled at his\nown joke. “Where will you be then?”\nLuthar didn’t even bother to look up. “Why don’t you keep your mind\non getting us across this damn plain, and leave the swords to those who\nknow the difference?” Logen grinned to himself. An argument between the\ntwo most arrogant men he had ever met was well worth watching, in his\nopinion.\n“Huh,” snorted Longfoot, “show me someone who knows the difference\nand I’ll happily never mention blades again.” He lifted the apple to his\nmouth, but before he could bite into it, his hand was empty. Luthar had\nmoved almost too fast to follow, and speared it on the glinting point of his\nsword. “Give me that back!”\nLuthar stood up. “Of course,” he tossed it off the end of the blade with a\npractised flick of his wrist. Before Longfoot’s reaching hands could close\naround it, Luthar had snatched his short sword from its sheath and whipped\nit blurring through the air. The Navigator was left juggling with the two\neven halves for a moment before dropping them both in the dirt.\n“Damn your showing off!” he snapped.\n“We can’t all have your modesty,” muttered Luthar. Logen chuckled to\nhimself while Longfoot stomped back over to the tree, staring up into the\nbranches for another apple.\n“Nice trick,” he grunted, strolling through the weeds to where Luthar\nwas sitting. “You’re quick with those needles.”\nThe young man gave a modest shrug. “It has been remarked upon.”\n“Mmm.” Stabbing an apple and stabbing a man were two different\nthings, but quickness was some kind of start. Logen looked down at Ferro’s\nsword, turned it over in his hands, then slid it out from its wooden sheath. It\nwas a strange weapon to his mind, grip and blade both gently curved,\nthicker at the end than at the hilt, sharpened only down one edge, with\nscarcely any point on it at all. He swung it in the air a couple of times.\nStrange weight, more like an axe than a sword.\n“Odd-looking thing,” muttered Luthar.\nLogen checked the edge with his thumb. Rough-feeling, it dragged at the\nskin. “Sharp, though.”\n“Don’t you ever sharpen yours?”\nLogen frowned. He reckoned he must have spent weeks of his life, all\ntold, sharpening the weapons he’d carried. Every night, out on the trail,\nafter the meal, men would sit and work at their gear, steel scraping on metal\nand stone, flashing in the light of the campfires.

His hair might have been caked with mud, his skin\nstiff with old sweat, his clothes riddled with lice, but his weapons had\nalways gleamed like the new moon.\nHe took hold of the cold grip and pulled the sword that Bayaz had given\nhim out of its stained scabbard. It looked a slow and ugly thing compared to\nLuthar’s swords, and to Ferro’s too, if it came to that. There was hardly any\nshine on the heavy grey blade at all. He turned it over in his hand. The\nsingle silver letter glinted near the hilt. The mark of Kanedias.\n“Don’t know why, but it doesn’t need sharpening. I tried it to begin with,\nbut all it did was wear down the stone.” Longfoot had hauled himself up\ninto one of the trees, and was slithering along a thick branch towards an\napple hanging out of reach near its end.\n“If you ask me,” grunted the Navigator, “the weapons suit their owners\nto the ground. Captain Luthar—flash and fine-looking but never used in\ncombat. The woman Maljinn—sharp and vicious and worrying to look\nupon. The Northman Ninefingers—heavy, solid, slow, and simple. Hah!” he\nchuckled, dragging himself slightly further down the limb. “A most fitting\nmetaphor! Juggling with words has always been but one among my many\nremarkable—”\nLogen grunted as he swung the sword over his head. It bit through the\nbranch where it met the trunk, clean through, almost to the other side. More\nthan far enough that Longfoot’s weight ripped through the rest, and brought\nthe whole limb, Navigator and all, crashing down into the weeds below.\n“Slow and simple enough for you?”\nLuthar spluttered with laughter as he sharpened his short sword, and\nLogen laughed as well. Laughing with a man was a good step forward. First\ncomes the laughter, then the respect, then the trust.\n“God’s breath!” shouted Longfoot, scrabbling his way out from under\nthe branch. “Can a man not eat without disturbance?”\n“Sharp enough,” chuckled Luthar. “No doubt.”\nLogen hefted the sword in his hand. “Yes, this Kanedias knew how to\nmake a weapon, alright.”\n“Making weapons is what Kanedias did.” Bayaz had stepped through the\ncrumbling archway and into the overgrown orchard. “He was the Master\nMaker, after all. The one that you hold is among the very least of what he\nmade, forged to be used in a war against his brothers.”\n“Brothers,” snorted Luthar. “I know exactly how he felt. There’s always\nsomething. Usually a woman, in my experience.” He gave his short sword\none last stroke with the whetstone. “And where women are concerned, I\nalways come out on top.”\n“Is that so?” Bayaz snorted. “As it happens, a woman did enter the case,\nbut not in the way you’re thinking.”\nLuthar gave a sickening grin. “What other way is there to think about\nwomen?

Ferro was squatting on top, wiping\nher hand on a spray of ivy. It was hard to tell with the bright sky behind, but\nLogen wondered if she might not have the trace of a smile on her face.\nLuthar certainly wasn’t smiling. “You fucking mad bitch!” he screamed,\nscraping the white goo from his coat and flinging it at the wall. “Bunch of\nbloody savages!” And he shoved angrily past and through the fallen arch.\nLaughter was one thing, it seemed, but the respect might be a while coming.\n“In case any of you pinks are interested,” called Ferro, “the riders are\ngone.”\n“Which way?” asked Bayaz.\n“Away east, the way we came, riding hard.”\n“Looking for us?”\n“Who knows? They didn’t have signs. But if they are looking, more than\nlikely they will find our trail.”\nThe Magus frowned. “Then you’d best get down from there. We need to\nmove.” He thought about it for a moment. “And try not to throw any more\nshit!”\nAnd Next… My Gold\nTo Sand dan Glokta, Superior of Dagoska, and for his eyes alone.\nI am most troubled to discover that you think yourself short of both\nmen and money.\nAs far as soldiers are concerned, you must make do with what you\nhave, or what you can procure. As you are already well aware, the\ngreat majority of our strength is committed in Angland.\nUnfortunately, a certain rebellious temper among the peasantry\nthroughout Midderland is more than occupying what remains.\nAs to the question of funds, I fear that nothing can be spared. You\nwill not ask again. I advise you to squeeze what you can from the\nSpicers, from the natives, from anyone else who is to hand. Borrow\nand make do, Glokta. Demonstrate that resourcefulness that made\nyou so famous in the Kantic War.\nI trust that you will not disappoint me.\nSult\nArch Lector of His Majesty’s Inquisition.\nM\natters proceed with the greatest speed, Superior, if I may say so.

Only narrow dams hold back the brine at either end,\nand at your order the entire business is ready to be flooded!” Vissbruck sat\nback with a happy smile on his plump face. Quite as if the whole thing had\nbeen his idea.\nBelow them in the Upper City, the morning chanting was beginning. A\nstrange wailing that drifted from the spires of the Great Temple, out over\nDagoska, and into every building, even here, in the audience chamber of the\nCitadel.

We should never have let them back\ninto their temple! Damn their bloody chanting, it gives me a headache!”\nAnd it’s worth it for that alone. Glokta grinned. “If it makes Kahdia\nhappy, your headache is something I can live with. Like it or not, we need\nthe natives, and the natives like to chant. Get used to it, is my advice. That\nor wrap a blanket round your head.”\nVissbruck sat back in his chair and listened while Vurms sulked. “I have\nto admit that I find the sound rather soothing, and we cannot deny the effect\nthe Superior’s concessions have had on the natives. With their help the land\nwalls are repaired, the gates are replaced, and the scaffolds are already\nbeing dismantled. Stone has been acquired for new parapets, but, ah, and\nhere is the problem, the masons refuse to work another day without money.\nMy soldiers are on quarter pay, and morale is low. Debt is the problem,\nSuperior.”\n“I’ll say it is,” muttered Vurms angrily. “The granaries are close to\ncapacity, and two new wells have been dug in the Lower City, at great\nexpense, but my credit is utterly exhausted. The grain merchants are after\nmy blood!” A damn sight less keenly than every merchant in the city is after\nmine, I daresay. “I can scarcely show my face any longer for their\nclamouring. My reputation is in jeopardy, Superior!”\nAs if I had no larger concerns than the reputation of this dolt. “How\nmuch do we owe?”\nVurms frowned. “For food, water, and general equipment, no less than a\nhundred thousand.” A hundred thousand? The Spicers love making money,\nbut they hate spending it more. Eider will not come up with half so much, if\nshe even chooses to try.\n“What about you, General?”\n“The cost of hiring mercenaries, excavating the ditch, of the repairs to\nthe walls, of extra weapons, armour, ammunition…” Vissbruck puffed out\nhis cheeks. “In all, it comes to nearly four hundred thousand marks.”\nIt was the most Glokta could do to keep from choking on his own\ntongue. Half a million? A King’s ransom and more besides. I doubt that Sult\ncould provide so much, even if he had the mind, and he does not. Men die\nall the time over debts a fraction of the size. “Work however you can.\nPromise whatever you want. The money is on its way, I assure you.”\nThe General was already collecting his notes. “I am doing all I can, but\npeople are beginning to doubt that they will ever be paid.”\nVurms was more direct. “No one trusts us any longer. Without money,\nwe can do nothing.”\nN\nothing,” growled Severard.

They break\ndown the door and find…” Nothing. “The bed has been slept in, but there is\nno body. Not the slightest sign of a struggle even.”\n“Nothing,” muttered Severard.\n“What do we know? Davoust suspected a conspiracy within the city, a\ntraitor intending to deliver Dagoska to the Gurkish. He believed a member\nof the ruling council was involved. It would seem likely that he uncovered\nthe identity of this person, and was somehow silenced.”\n“But who?”\nWe must turn the question on its head. “If we cannot find our traitor, we\nmust make them come to us. If they work to get the Gurkish in, we need\nonly succeed in keeping them out. Sooner or later, they will show\nthemselves.”\n“Rithky,” mumbled Frost. Risky indeed, especially for Dagoska’s latest\nSuperior of the Inquisition, but we have no choices.\n“So we wait?” asked Severard.\n“We wait, and we look to our defences. That and we try to find some\nmoney. Do you have any cash, Severard?”\n“I did have some. I gave it to a girl, down in the slums.”\n“Ah. Shame.”\n“Not really, she fucks like a madman. I’d thoroughly recommend her, if\nyou’re interested.”\nGlokta winced as his knee clicked. “What a thoroughly heart-warming\ntale, Severard, I never had you down for a romantic. I’d sing a ballad if I\nwasn’t so short of funds.”\n“I could ask around. How much are we talking about?”\n“Oh, not much. Say, half a million marks?”\nOne of the Practical’s eyebrows went up sharply. He reached into his\npocket, dug around for a moment, pulled his hand out, and opened it. A few\ncopper coins shone in his palm.\n“Twelve bits,” he said. “Twelve bits is all I can raise.”\nT\nwelve thousand is all I can raise,” said Magister Eider. Scarcely a drop in\nthe bucket. “My Guild are nervous, business has not been good, the great\nmajority of their assets are bound up in ventures of one kind or another. I\nhave little cash to hand either.”\nI daresay you have a good deal more than twelve thousand, but what’s\nthe difference? I doubt even you have half a million tucked away. There\nprobably isn’t that amount in the whole city. “One would almost think they\ndidn’t like me.”\nShe snorted. “Turning them out of the temple? Arming the natives? Then\ndemanding money? It might be fair to say you’re not their favourite\nperson.”\n“Might it be fair to say they’re after my blood?” And plenty of it, I\nshouldn’t wonder.\n“It might, but for the time being, at least, I think I’ve managed to\nconvince them that you’re a good thing for the city.” She looked levelly at\nhim for a moment. “You are a good thing, aren’t you?”\n“If keeping the Gurkish out is your priority.” That is our priority, isn’t\nit? “More money wouldn’t hurt, though.”"

They\nmuch prefer making it to spending it, even when it’s in their own best\ninterests.” She gave a heavy sigh, rapped her fingernails on the table, looked\ndown at her hand. She seemed to consider a moment, then she began to pull\nthe rings from her fingers. When she had finally got them all off, she tossed\nthem into the box along with the coins.\nGlokta frowned. “A winning gesture, Magister, but I could not possibly\n—”\n“I insist,” she said, unclasping her heavy necklace and dropping it into\nthe box. “I can always get more, once you’ve saved the city. In any case,\nthey’ll do me no good when the Gurkish rip them from my corpse, will\nthey?” She slipped her heavy bracelets off her wrists, yellow gold, studded\nwith green gemstones. They rattled down amongst the rest. “Take the\njewels, before I change my mind. A man lost in the desert should take such\nwater—”\n“As he is offered, regardless of the source. Kahdia told me the very\nsame thing.”\n“Kahdia is a clever man.”\n“He is. I thank you for your generosity, Magister.” Glokta snapped the\nlid of the box shut.\n“The least I could do.” She got up from her chair and walked to the door,\nher sandals hissing across the carpet. “I will speak with you soon.”\nH\ne says he must speak with you now.”\n“What was his name, Shickel?”\n“Mauthis. A banker.”\nOne more creditor, come clamouring for his money. Sooner or later I’ll\nhave to just arrest the pack of them. That will be the end of my little\nspending spree, but it will almost be worth it to see the looks on their faces.\nGlokta gave a hopeless shrug. “Send him in.”\nHe was a tall man in his fifties, almost ill-looking in his gauntness,\nhollow-cheeked and sunken-eyed. There was a stern precision to his\nmovements, a steady coldness to his gaze. As though he is weighing the\nvalue of all he looks at in silver marks, including me.\n“My name is Mauthis.”\n“I was informed, but I am afraid that there are no funds available at the\npresent moment.” Unless you count Severard’s twelve bits. “Whatever debt\nthe city has with your bank will have to wait. It will not be for much longer,\nI assure you.” Just until the sea dries up, the sky falls in, and devils roam\nthe earth.\nMauthis gave a smile. If you could call it that. A neat, precise, and\nutterly joyless curving of the mouth. “You misunderstand me, Superior\nGlokta. I have not come to collect a debt. For seven years, I have had the\nprivilege of acting as the chief representative in Dagoska, of the banking\nhouse of Valint and Balk.”\nGlokta paused, then tried to sound offhand. “Valint and Balk, you say?"

        "text": "privilege of acting as the chief representative in Dagoska, of the banking\nhouse of Valint and Balk.”\nGlokta paused, then tried to sound offhand. “Valint and Balk, you say?\nYour bank financed the Guild of Mercers, I believe.”\n“We had some dealings with that guild, before their unfortunate fall\nfrom grace.” I’ll say you did. You owned them, from the ground up. “But\nthen we have dealings with many guilds, and companies, and other banks,\nand individuals, great and small. Today I have dealings with you.”\n“Dealings of what nature?”\nMauthis turned to the door and snapped his fingers. Two burly natives\nentered, grunting, sweating, struggling under the weight of a great casket: a\nbox of polished black wood, bound with bands of bright steel, sealed with a\nheavy lock. They set it down carefully on the fine carpet, wiped sweat from\ntheir foreheads, and tramped out the way they came while Glokta frowned\nafter them. What is this? Mauthis pulled a key from his pocket and turned it\nin the lock. He reached forward and lifted the lid of the chest. He moved out\nof the way, carefully and precisely, so Glokta could see the contents.\n“One hundred and fifty thousand marks in silver.”\nGlokta blinked. And so it is. The coins flashed and glittered in the\nevening light. Flat, round, silver, five-mark pieces. Not a jingling heap, not\nsome barbarian’s horde. Neat, even stacks, held in place by wooden dowels.\nAs neat and even as Mauthis himself.\nThe two porters were gasping their way back into the room, carrying\nbetween them a second box, slightly smaller than the first. They placed it on\nthe floor and strode out, not so much as glancing at the fortune glittering in\nplain view beside them.\nMauthis unlocked the second chest with the same key, raised the lid, and\nstood aside. “Three hundred and fifty thousand marks in gold.”\nGlokta knew his mouth was open, but he could not close it. Bright,\nclean, gold, glowing yellow. All that wealth seemed almost to give off\nwarmth, like a bonfire. It tugged at him, dragged at him, pulled him\nforward. He took a hesitant step, in fact, before he stopped himself. Great\nbig, golden, fifty-mark pieces. Neat, even stacks, just as before. Most men\nwould never in their lives see such coins. Few men indeed can ever have\nseen so many.\nMauthis reached into his coat and pulled out a flat leather case. He\nplaced it carefully on the table and unfolded it: once, twice, three times.\n“One half of one million marks in polished stones.”\nThere they lay on the soft black leather, on the hard brown tabletop,\nburning with all the colours under the sun. Two large handfuls, perhaps, of\nmulticoloured, glittering gravel. Glokta stared down at them, numb, and\nsucked at his gums. Magister Eider’s jewels seem suddenly rather quaint.\n“In total, I have been ordered by my superiors to advance to you, Sand\ndan Glokta, Superior of Dagoska, the sum of precisely one million marks.”\nHe unrolled a heavy paper. “You will sign here.”"

His left eye gave a\nflurry of twitches. “Why?”\n“To certify that you received the money.”\nGlokta almost laughed. “Not that! Why the money?” He flailed one hand\nat it all. “Why all this?”\n“It would appear that my employers share your concern that Dagoska\nshould not fall to the Gurkish. More than that I cannot tell you.”\n“Cannot, or will not?”\n“Cannot. Will not.”\nGlokta frowned at the jewels, at the silver, at the gold. His leg was\nthrobbing, dully. All that I wanted, and far more. But banks do not become\nbanks by giving money away. “If this is a loan, what is the interest?”\nMauthis flashed his icy smile again. “My employers would prefer to call\nit a contribution to the defence of the city. There is one condition, however.”\n“Which is?”\n“It may be that in the future, a representative of the banking house of\nValint and Balk will come to you requesting… favours. It is the most\nearnest hope of my employers that, if and when that time comes, you will\nnot disappoint them.”\nOne million marks’ worth of favours. And I place myself in the power of\na most suspect organisation. An organisation whose motives I do not begin\nto understand. An organisation that, until recently, I was on the point of\ninvestigating for high treason. But what are my options? Without money, the\ncity is lost, and I am finished. I needed a miracle, and here it is, sparkling\nbefore me. A man lost in the desert must take such water as is offered…\nMauthis slid the document across the table. Several blocks of neat\nwriting, and a space, for a name. For my name. Not at all unlike a paper of\nconfession. And prisoners always sign their confessions. They are only\noffered when there is no choice.\nGlokta reached for the pen, dipped it in the ink, wrote his name in the\nspace provided.\n“That concludes our business.” Mauthis rolled up the document,\nsmoothly and precisely. He slipped it carefully into his coat. “My\ncolleagues and I are leaving Dagoska this evening.” A great deal of money\nto contribute to the cause, but precious little confidence in it. “Valint and\nBalk are closing their offices here, but perhaps we will meet in Adua, once\nthis unfortunate situation with the Gurkish is resolved.” The man gave his\nmechanical smile one more time. “Don’t spend it all at once.” And he\nturned on his heel and strode out, leaving Glokta alone with his\nmonumental windfall.\nHe shuffled over to it, breathing hard, and stared down. There was\nsomething obscene about all that money. Something disgusting. Something\nfrightening, almost. He snapped shut the lids of the two chests. He locked\nthem with trembling hands. He shoved the key in his inside pocket. He\nstroked the metal bindings of the two boxes with his fingertips. His palms\nwere greasy with sweat. I am rich."

The dim light shone back at him\nthrough the many facets, a thousand brilliant sparks of fire—blue, green,\nred, white. Glokta did not know much about gemstones, but he was\nreasonably sure that this one was a diamond. I am very, very rich.\nHe looked back at the rest, sparkling on the flat piece of leather. Some of\nthem were small, but many were not. Several were larger than the one he\nheld in his hand. I am immensely, fabulously wealthy. Imagine what one\ncould do with so much money. Imagine what one could control… perhaps,\nwith this much, I can save the city. More walls, more supplies, more\nequipment, more mercenaries. The Gurkish, thrown back from Dagoska in\ndisarray. The Emperor of Gurkhul, humbled. Who would have thought it?\nSand dan Glokta, once more the hero.\nHe rolled the shining little pebbles around with a fingertip, lost in\nthought. But so much spending in so little time could raise questions. My\nfaithful servant Practical Vitari would be curious, and she would make my\nnoble master the Arch Lector curious. One day I beg for money, the next I\nspend it as if it burns? I was forced to borrow, Your Eminence. Indeed?\nHow much? No more than a million marks. Indeed? And who would lend\nsuch a sum? Why, our old friends at the banking house of Valint and Balk,\nYour Eminence, in return for unspecified favours, which they might call in\nat any moment. Of course, my loyalty is still beyond question. You\nunderstand, don’t you? I mean to say, it’s only a fortune in jewels. Body\nfound floating by the docks…\nHe pushed his hand absently through the cold, hard, glittering stones,\nand they tickled pleasantly at the skin between his fingers. Pleasant, but\nperilous. We must still tread carefully. More carefully than ever…\nFear\nI\nt was a long way to the edge of the World, of that there could be no doubt.\nA long, and a lonely, and a nervous way. The sight of the corpses on the\nplain had worried everyone. The passing riders had made matters worse.\nThe discomforts of the journey had in no way diminished. Jezal was still\nconstantly hungry, usually too cold, often wet through, and would probably\nbe saddle sore for the rest of his days. Every night he stretched out on the\nhard and lumpy ground, dozed and dreamed of home, only to wake to the\npale morning more tired and aching than when he lay down. His skin\ncrawled, and chafed, and stung with the unfamiliar feeling of dirt, and he\nwas forced to admit that he had begun to smell almost as vile as the others.\nIt was enough, altogether, to make a civilised man run mad, and now, to add\nto all of this, there was the constant nagging of danger."

        "text": "It was enough, altogether, to make a civilised man run mad, and now, to add\nto all of this, there was the constant nagging of danger.\nFrom that point of view, the terrain was not on Jezal’s side. Hoping to\nshake off any pursuers, Bayaz had ordered them away from the river a few\ndays earlier. The ancient road wound now through deep scars in the plain,\nthrough rocky gullies, through shadowy gorges, alongside chattering\nstreams in deep valleys.\nJezal began to think on the endless, grinding flatness almost with\nnostalgia. At least out there one did not look at every rock, and shrub, and\nfold in the ground and wonder whether there was a crowd of bloodthirsty\nenemies behind it. He had chewed his fingernails almost until the blood ran.\nEvery sound made him bite his tongue and spin around in his saddle,\nclutching at his steels, staring for a murderer, who turned out to be a bird in\na bush. It was not fear, of course, for Jezal dan Luthar, he told himself,\nwould laugh in the face of danger. An ambush, or a battle, or a breathless\npursuit across the plain—these things, he imagined, he could have taken in\nhis stride. But this endless waiting, this mindless tension, this merciless\nrubbing-by of slow minutes was almost more than he could stand.\nIt might have helped had there been someone with whom he could share\nhis unease, but as far as companionship went, little had changed. The cart\nstill rolled along the cracked old road while Quai sat grim and silent on top.\nBayaz said nothing but for the occasional lecture on the qualities of great\nleadership, qualities which seemed markedly absent in himself. Longfoot\nwas off scouting out the route, only appearing every day or two to let them\nknow how skilfully he was doing it. Ferro frowned at everything as though\nit was her personal enemy, and at Jezal most of all, it sometimes seemed,\nher hands never far from her weapons. She spoke rarely, and then only to\nNinefingers, to snarl about ambushes, or covering their tracks better, or the\npossibilities of being followed.\nThe Northman himself was something of a puzzle. When Jezal had first\nlaid eyes on him, gawping at the gate of the Agriont, he had seemed less\nthan an animal. Out here in the wild, though, the rules were different. One\ncould not simply walk away from a man one disliked, then do one’s best to\navoid him, belittle him in company, and insult him behind his back. Out\nhere you were stuck with the companions you had, and, being stuck with\nhim, Jezal had come slowly to realise that Ninefingers was just a man, after\nall. A stupid, and a thuggish, and a hideously ugly one, no doubt. As far as\nwit and culture went, he was a cut below the lowliest peasant in the fields of\nthe Union, but Jezal had to admit that out of all the group, the Northman\nwas the one he had come to hate least. He had not the pomposity of Bayaz,\nthe watchfulness of Quai, the boastfulness of Longfoot, or the simple"

Jezal would not have been ashamed to ask a farmer\nhis opinion on the raising of crops, or a smith his opinion on the making of\narmour, however dirty, ugly or lowborn they might have been. Why not\nconsult a hardened killer on the subject of violence?\n“I understand that you have led men in battle,” Jezal tried as his\nopening.\nThe Northman turned his dark, slow eyes on him. “More than once.”\n“And fought in duels.”\n“Aye.” He scratched at the ragged scars on his stubbly cheek. “I didn’t\ncome to look like this from a wobbly hand at shaving.”\n“If your hand was that wobbly, you would choose, perhaps, to grow a\nbeard.”\nNinefingers chuckled. Jezal was almost used to the sight now. It was still\nhideous, of course, but smacked more of good-natured ape than crazed\nmurderer. “I might at that,” he said.\nJezal thought about it a moment. He did not wish to make himself\nappear weak, but honesty might earn the trust of a simple man. If it worked\nwith dogs, why not with Northmen? “I myself,” he ventured, “have never\nfought in a full-blooded battle.”\n“You don’t say?”\n“No, truly. My friends are in Angland now, fighting against Bethod and\nhis savages.” Ninefingers’ eyes swivelled sideways. “I mean… that is to\nsay… fighting against Bethod. I would be with them myself, had not Bayaz\nasked me to come on this… venture.”\n“Their loss is our gain.”\nJezal looked sharply across. From a subtler source, that might almost\nhave sounded like sarcasm. “Bethod started this war, of course. A most\ndishonourable act of unprovoked aggression on his part.”\n“You’ll get no argument from me on that score. Bethod’s got a gift when\nit comes to starting wars. The only thing he’s better at is the finishing of\n’em.”\nJezal laughed. “You can’t mean that you think he’ll beat the Union?”\n“He’s beaten worse odds, but you know best. We don’t all have your\nexperience.”\nThe laughter stuttered out in Jezal’s throat. He was almost sure that had\nbeen irony, and it made him think for a moment. Was Ninefingers looking at\nhim now, and behind that scarred, that plodding, that battered mask\nthinking, “What a fool”? Could it be that Bayaz had been right? That there\nwas something to be learned from this Northman after all? There was only\none way to find out.\n“What’s a battle like?” he asked.\n“Battles are like men. No two are ever quite the same.”\n“How do you mean?”\n“Imagine waking up at night to hear a crashing and a shouting,\nscrambling out of your tent into the snow with your trousers falling down,\nto see men all around you killing one another. Nothing but moonlight to see\nby, no clue who’re enemies and who’re friends, no weapon to fight with.”"

Nothing but moonlight to see\nby, no clue who’re enemies and who’re friends, no weapon to fight with.”\n“Confusing,” said Jezal.\n“No doubt. Or imagine crawling in the mud, between the stomping\nboots, trying to get away but not knowing where to go, with an arrow in\nyour back and a sword cut across your arse, squealing like a pig and waiting\nfor a spear to stick you through, a spear you won’t even see coming.”\n“Painful,” agreed Jezal.\n“Very. Or imagine standing in a circle of shields no more than ten strides\nacross, all held by men roaring their loudest. There’s just you and one other\nman in there, and that man’s won a reputation for being the hardest bastard\nin the North, and only one of you can leave alive.”\n“Hmm,” murmured Jezal.\n“That’s right. You like the sound of any of those?” Jezal did not, and\nNinefingers smiled. “I didn’t think so, and honestly? Nor do I. I’ve been in\nall kind of battles, and skirmishes, and fights. Most of them started in chaos,\nand all of ’em ended in it, and not once did I not come near to shitting\nmyself at some point.”\n“You?”\nThe Northman chuckled. “Fearlessness is a fool’s boast, to my mind.\nThe only men with no fear in them are the dead, or the soon to be dead,\nmaybe. Fear teaches you caution, and respect for your enemy, and to avoid\nsharp edges used in anger. All good things in their place, believe me. Fear\ncan bring you out alive, and that’s the very best anyone can hope for from\nany fight. Every man who’s worth a damn feels fear. It’s the use you make\nof it that counts.”\n“Be scared? That’s your advice?”\n“My advice would be to find a good woman and steer well clear of the\nwhole bloody business, and it’s a shame no one told me the same twenty\nyears ago.” He looked sideways at Jezal. “But if, say, you’re stuck out on\nsome great wide plain in the middle of nowhere and can’t avoid it, there’s\nthree rules I’d take to a fight. First, always do your best to look the coward,\nthe weakling, the fool. Silence is a warrior’s best armour, the saying goes.\nHard looks and hard words have never won a battle yet, but they’ve lost a\nfew.”\n“Look the fool, eh? I see.” Jezal had built his whole life around trying to\nappear the cleverest, the strongest, the most noble. It was an intriguing idea,\nthat a man might choose to look like less than he was.\n“Second, never take an enemy lightly, however much the dullard he\nseems. Treat every man like he’s twice as clever, twice as strong, twice as\nfast as you are, and you’ll only be pleasantly surprised. Respect costs you\nnothing, and nothing gets a man killed quicker than confidence.”\n“Never underestimate the foe. A wise precaution.” Jezal was beginning\nto realise that he had underestimated this Northman. He wasn’t half the\nidiot he appeared to be.\n“Third, watch your opponent as close as you can, and listen to opinions"

What about the other half?”\nThe Northman shrugged. “Luck.”\nI\ndon’t like this,” growled Ferro, frowning up at the steep sides of the\ngorge. Jezal wondered if there was anything in the world she did like.\n“You think we’re followed?” asked Bayaz. “You see anyone?”\n“How could I see anyone from down here? That’s the point!”\n“Good ground for an ambush,” muttered Ninefingers. Jezal looked\naround him nervously. Broken rocks, bushes, scrubby trees—the ground\nwas full of hiding places.\n“Well, this is the route that Longfoot picked for us,” grumbled Bayaz,\n“and there’s no purpose in hiring a cleaner if you’re going to swab the\nlatrines yourself.

Quai hauled on the reins and brought the cart to a\nsudden halt. Jezal looked along the lip of the gorge, his heart thumping in\nhis mouth. He saw the speaker now. A big man dressed in antique leather\narmour, sitting carelessly on the edge of the drop with one leg dangling, his\nlong hair flapping softly in the breeze. A pleasant and a friendly-looking\nman, as far as Jezal could tell at this distance, with a wide smile on his face.\n“My name is Finnius, a humble servant of the Emperor Cabrian!”\n“Cabrian?” shouted Bayaz. “I heard he’d lost his reason!”\n“He’s got some interesting ideas.” Finnius shrugged. “But he’s always\nseen us right. Let me explain matters—we’re all around you!” A serious-\nseeming man with a short sword and shield stepped out from behind the\ndead tree trunk.

No jokes, please no jokes, but Finnius only chuckled.\n“They didn’t tell me you were funny. Reckon that’s a bonus. At least until\nwe kill you. Where’s the other one, eh? The Navigator?”\n“No idea,” growled Bayaz, “unfortunately. If anyone dies, it should be\nhim.”\n“Don’t take it too hard. We’ll catch up with him later.” And Finnius\nlaughed an easy laugh, and the men around them grinned and fingered their\nweapons. “So if you’d be good enough to give your arms to those fellows\nahead of you, we can get you trussed up and start back towards Darmium\nbefore nightfall!”\n“And when we get there?”\nFinnius gave a happy shrug. “Not my business. I don’t ask questions of\nthe Emperor, and you don’t ask questions of me. That way, no one gets\nskinned alive. Do you take my meaning, old man?”\n“Your meaning is hard to miss, but I am afraid that Darmium is quite out\nof our way.”\n“What are you,” called Finnius, “soft in the head?”\nThe nearest man stepped forward and grabbed hold of Bayaz’s bridle.\n“That’s enough of that,” he growled.\nJezal felt that horrible sucking in his guts. The air around Bayaz’s\nshoulders trembled, like the hot air above a forge. The foremost of the men\nfrowned, opened his mouth to speak. His face seemed to flatten, then his\nhead broke open and he was suddenly snatched away as though flicked by a\ngiant, unseen finger. He had not even time to scream."

He had not even time to scream.\nNor had the four men who stood behind him. Their ruined bodies, the\nbroken remnants of the grey tree trunk, and a great quantity of earth and\nrocks around them were ripped from the ground and flung through the air to\nshatter against the rocky wall of the gorge a hundred strides distant with a\nsound like a house collapsing.\nJezal’s mouth hung open. His body froze. It had taken only a terrifying\ninstant. One moment five men had been standing there, the next they were\nslaughtered meat among a heap of settling debris. Somewhere behind him\nhe heard the hum of a bowstring. There was a cry and a body dropped down\ninto the valley, bounced from the sheer rocks and flopped rag-like,\nfacedown in the stream.\n“Ride, then!” roared Bayaz, but Jezal could only sit in his saddle and\ngape. The air around the Magus was still moving, more than ever. The rocks\nbehind him rippled and twisted like the stones on the bed of a stream. The\nold man frowned, stared down at his hands. “No…” he muttered, turning\nthem over before him.\nThe brown leaves on the ground were lifting up into the air, fluttering as\nthough on a gust of wind. “No,” said Bayaz, his eyes opening wide. His\nwhole body had begun to shake. Jezal gawped as the loose stones around\nthem rose from the ground, drifting impossibly upwards. Sticks began to\nsnap from the bushes, clods of grass began to tear themselves away from\nthe rocks, his coat rustled and flapped, dragged upwards by some unseen\nforce.\n“No!” screamed Bayaz, then his shoulders hunched in a sudden spasm.\nA tree beside them split apart with a deafening crack and splinters of wood\nshowered out into the whipping air. Someone was shouting, but Jezal could\nscarcely hear them. His horse reared and he had not the wit to hold on. He\ncrashed onto his back on the earth while the whole valley shimmered,\ntrembled, vibrated around him.\nBayaz’s head snapped back, rigid, one hand up and clawing at the air. A\nrock the size of a man’s head flew past Jezal’s face and burst apart against a\nboulder. The air was filled with a storm of whipping rubbish, of fragments\nof wood, and stone, and soil, and broken gear. Jezal’s ears were ringing with\na terrifying clattering, rattling, howling. He flung himself down on his face,\ncrossed his arms over his head, and squeezed his eyes shut.\nHe thought of his friends. Of West, and Jalenhorm, and Kaspa, of\nLieutenant Brint even. He thought of his family and his home, of his father\nand his brothers. He thought of Ardee. If he lived to see them again, he\nwould be a better man. He swore it to himself with silent, trembling lips as\nthe unnatural wind ripped the valley apart around him. He would no longer\nbe selfish, no longer be vain, no longer be lazy. He would be a better friend,"

He would be a better friend,\na better son, a better lover, if only he lived through this. If only he lived\nthrough this. If only…\nHe could hear his own terrified breath coming in quick gasps, the blood\nsurging in his head.\nThe noise had stopped.\nJezal opened his eyes. He lifted his hands from his head and a shower of\ntwigs and soil fell around him. The gorge was full of settling leaves, misty\nwith choking dust. Ninefingers was standing nearby, red blood running\ndown his dirty face from a cut on his forehead. He was walking slowly\nsideways. He had his sword drawn, hanging down by his leg. Someone was\nfacing him. One of the men that had blocked the way behind them, a tall\nman with a mop of red hair. Circling each other. Jezal watched, kneeling,\nmouth wide open. He felt in some small way that he should intervene, but\nhe had not the beginnings of an idea how to do so.\nThe red-haired man moved suddenly, leaping forward and swinging his\nsword over his head. He moved fast, but Ninefingers was faster. He stepped\nsideways so that the whistling blade missed his face by inches, then he\nslashed his opponent across the belly as he passed. The man grunted,\nstumbled a step or two. Ninefingers’ heavy sword chopped into the back of\nhis skull with a hollow clicking sound. He tripped over his own feet and\npitched onto his face, blood bubbling from the gaping wound in his head.\nJezal watched it spread slowly out through the dirt around the corpse. A\nwide, dark pool, slowly mingling with the dust and the loose soil on the\nvalley floor. No second touch. No best of three.\nHe became aware of a scuffling, grunting sound, and looked up to see\nNinefingers staggering around with another man, a great big man. The two\nof them were growling and clawing at each other, wrestling over a knife.\nJezal gawped at them. When had that happened?\n“Stab him!” shouted Ninefingers as the two of them grappled. “Fucking\nstab him!” Jezal knelt there, staring up. One hand gripped the hilt of his\nlong steel as though he were hanging off a cliff and this was the last handful\nof grass, the other hung limp.\nThere was a gentle thud. The big man grunted. There was an arrow\nsticking out of his side. Another thud. Two arrows. A third appeared, tightly\ngrouped. He slid slowly out of Ninefingers’ grip, onto his knees, coughing\nand moaning. He crawled towards Jezal, sat back slowly, grimacing and\nmaking a strange mewling sound. He lay back in the road, the arrows\nsticking up into the air like rushes in the shallows of a lake. He was still.\n“What about that Finnius bastard?”\n“He got away.”\n“He’ll get others!”\n“It was deal with him or deal with that one there.”\n“I had that one!”\n“’Course you did. If you could have held him another year, maybe\nLuthar might have got round to drawing a blade, eh?”"

Jezal wobbled slowly up to his\nfeet. His mouth was dry, his knees were weak, his ears were ringing. Bayaz\nlay in the road on his back a few strides away, his apprentice kneeling\nbeside him. One of the wizard’s eyes was closed, the other slightly open,\nthe lid twitching, a slit of white eyeball showing underneath.\n“You can let go of that now.” Jezal looked down. His hand was still\nclenched around the grip of his steel, knuckles white. He willed his fingers\nto relax and they slowly uncurled, far away. His palm ached from all that\ngripping. Jezal felt a heavy hand on his shoulder. “You alright?”\nNinefingers’ voice.\n“Eh?”\n“You hurt?”\nJezal stared at himself, turning his hands over stupidly. Dirty, but no\nblood. “I don’t think so.”\n“Good. The horses ran. Who can blame them, right? If I had four legs,\nI’d be halfway back to the sea by now.”\n“What?”\n“Why don’t you catch them?”\n“Who made you the leader?”\nNinefingers’ heavy brows drew in slightly. Jezal became aware that they\nwere standing very close to one another, and that the Northman’s hand was\nstill on his shoulder. It was only resting there, but he could feel the strength\nof it through his coat, and it felt strong enough to twist his arm off. Damn\nhis mouth, it got him in all kinds of trouble. He expected a punch in the face\nat the very least, if not a fatal wound in his head, but Ninefingers only\npursed his lips thoughtfully and began to speak.\n“We’re a lot different, you and me. Different in all kind of ways. I see\nyou don’t have much respect for my kind, or for me in particular, and I\ndon’t much blame you. The dead know I got my shortcomings, and I ain’t\nentirely ignorant of ’em. You may think you’re a clever man, and I’m a\nstupid one, and I daresay you’re right. There’s sure to be a very many things\nthat you know more about than I do. But when it comes to fighting, I’m\nsorry to say, there’s few men with a wider experience than me. No offence,\nbut we both know you’re not one of ’em. No one made me the leader, but\nthis is the task that needs doing.” He stepped closer still, his great paw\ngripping Jezal’s shoulder with a fatherly firmness, halfway between\nreassurance and threat. “Is that a worry?”\nJezal thought about it for a moment. He was out of his depth, and the\nevents of the past few minutes had demonstrated beyond question just how\nfar. He looked down at the man that Ninefingers had killed only a moment\nbefore, and the cleft in the back of his head yawned wide. Perhaps, for the\nmoment, it would be best if he simply did as he was told.\n“No worry,” he said."

Perhaps, for the\nmoment, it would be best if he simply did as he was told.\n“No worry,” he said.\n“Good!” Ninefingers grinned, clapped him on the shoulder, and let him\ngo. “Horses still need catching, and you’re the man for the job, I reckon.”\nJezal nodded, and stumbled away to look for them.\nOne Hundred Words\nT\nhere was something peculiar afoot, that was sure. Colonel Glokta tested\nhis limbs, but he appeared unable to move. The sun was blinding bright in\nhis eyes.\n“Did we beat the Gurkish?” he asked.\n“We certainly did,” said Haddish Kahdia, leaning over into Glokta’s\nfield of view. “With God’s help we put them to the sword. Butchered them\nlike cattle.” The old native went back to chewing on the severed hand he\nheld. He’d already got through a couple of fingers.\nGlokta raised his arm to take it, but there was nothing there, only a\nbloody stump, chewed off at the wrist. “I swear,” murmured the Colonel,\n“it’s my hand you’re eating.”\nKahdia smiled. “And it is entirely delicious. I do congratulate you.”\n“Utterly delicious,” muttered General Vissbruck, taking the hand from\nKahdia and sucking a strip of ragged flesh from it. “Must be all that fencing\nyou did as a young man.” There was blood smeared across his plump,\nsmiling face.\n“The fencing, of course,” said Glokta. “I’m glad you like it,” though the\nwhole business did seem somewhat strange.\n“We do, we do!” cried Vurms. He was cupping the remains of Glokta’s\nfoot in his hands like a slice of melon, and nibbling at it daintily. “All four\nof us are delighted! Tastes like roast pork!”\n“Like good cheese!” shouted Vissbruck.\n“Like sweet honey!” cooed Kahdia, sprinkling a little salt onto Glokta’s\nmidriff.\n“Like sweet money,” purred Magister Eider’s voice from somewhere\ndown below.\nGlokta propped himself up on his elbows. “Why, what are you doing\ndown there?”\nShe looked up and grinned at him. “You took my rings. The least you\ncan do is give me something in return.” Her teeth sank into his right thigh,\ndeep in like tiny daggers, and scooped out a neat ball of flesh. She slurped\nblood hungrily from the wound, tongue darting out across his skin.\nColonel Glokta raised his eyebrows. “You’re right, of course. Quite\nright.” It really hurt a great deal less than one would have expected, but\nsitting upright was rather draining. He fell back onto the sand and lay there,\nlooking up at the blue sky. “All of you are quite right.”\nShe had made it up to his hip now. “Ah,” giggled the Colonel, “that\ntickles!” What a pleasure it was, he thought, to be eaten by such a beautiful\nwoman. “A little to the left,” he murmured, closing his eyes, “just a little to\nthe left…”\nG"

His left leg trembled under the clammy sheet, wasted muscles\nknotted hard with searing cramps. He bit down on his lip with his remaining\nteeth to keep from screaming, snorted heaving gasps through his nose, face\nscrewed up with his furious efforts to control the pain.\nJust when it seemed that his leg would rip itself apart, the sinews\nsuddenly relaxed. Glokta collapsed back into his clammy bed and lay there,\nbreathing hard. Damn these fucking dreams. Every part of him was aching,\nevery part of him was weak and trembling, wet with cold sweat. He\nfrowned in the darkness. There was a strange sound filling the room. A\nrushing, hissing sound. What is that? Slowly, gingerly, he rolled over and\nlevered himself out of bed, hobbled to the window, and stood there, looking\nout.\nIt was as though the city beyond his room had vanished. A grey curtain\nhad descended, cutting him off from the world. Rain. It spattered against the\nsill, fat drops bursting into soft spray, throwing a cool mist into the\nchamber, dampening the carpet beneath the window, the drapes around the\nopening, soothing Glokta’s clammy skin. Rain. He had forgotten that such a\nthing existed.\nThere was a flash, lightning in the distance. The spires of the Great\nTemple were cut out black through the hissing murk for an instant, and then\nthe darkness closed back in, joined by a long, angry muttering of distant\nthunder. Glokta stuck his arm out through the window, felt the water\npattering cold against his skin. A strange, unfamiliar feeling.\n“I swear,” he murmured to himself.\n“The first rains come.” Glokta nearly choked as he spun around,\nstumbled, clutched at the wet stones around the window for support. It was\ndark as hell in the room, there was no telling where the voice had come\nfrom. Did I only imagine it? Am I still dreaming? “A sublime moment. The\nworld seems to live again.” Glokta’s heart froze in his chest. A man’s voice,\ndeep and rich. The voice of the one who took Davoust? Who will soon take\nme?\nThe room was illuminated by another brilliant flash. The speaker sat\ncross-legged on the carpet. An old black man with long hair. Between me\nand the door. No way past, even if I was a considerably better runner than I\nam. The light was gone as soon as it arrived, but the image persisted for a\nmoment, burned into Glokta’s eyes. Then came the crash of thunder\nsplitting the sky, echoing in the darkness of the wide chamber. No one\nwould hear my despairing screams for help, even if anyone cared.\n“Who the hell are you?” Glokta’s voice was squeaky with shock.\n“Yulwei is my name. You need not be alarmed.”\n“Not alarmed? Are you fucking joking?”"

Are you fucking joking?”\n“If I had a mind to kill you, you would have died in your sleep. I would\nhave left a body, though.”\n“Some comfort.” Glokta’s mind raced, thinking over the objects within\nreach. I might make it as far as the ornamental tea-jar on the table. He\nalmost laughed. And do what with it? Offer him tea? Nothing to fight with,\neven if I was a considerably more effective fighter than I am. “How did you\nget in?”\n“I have my ways. The same ways in which I crossed the wide desert,\ntravelled the busy road from Shaffa unobserved, passed through the Gurkish\nhost and into the city.”\n“And to think, you could have just knocked.”\n“Knocking does not guarantee an entrance.” Glokta’s eyes strained\nagainst the gloom, but he could see nothing beyond the vague grey outlines\nof furniture, the arched grey spaces of the other windows. The rain pattered\non the sill behind, hissed quietly on the roofs of the city below. Just when\nhe was wondering if his dream was over, the voice came again. “I have\nbeen watching the Gurkish, as I have these many years. That is my allotted\ntask. My penance, for the part I played in the schism that has split my\norder.”\n“Your order?”\n“The order of Magi. I am the fourth of Juvens’ twelve apprentices.”\nA Magus. I might have known. Like that bald old meddler Bayaz, and I\ngained nothing but confusion from him. As if there were not enough to\nworry about with politics and treachery, now we must have myth and\nsuperstition to boot. Still, it looks as if I will last out the night, at least.\n“A Magus, eh? Forgive me if I don’t celebrate. Such dealings as I’ve had\nwith your order have been a waste of my time, at best.”\n“Perhaps I can repair our reputation, then. I bring you information.”\n“Free of charge?”\n“This time. The Gurkish are moving. Five of their golden standards pass\ndown the peninsula tonight, under cover of the storm. Twenty thousand\nspears, with great engines of war. Five more standards wait behind the hills,\nand that is not all. The roads from Shaffa to Ul-Khatif, from Ul-Khatif to\nDaleppa, from Daleppa to the sea—all are thick with soldiers. The Emperor\nputs forth all his strength. The whole South moves. Conscripts from Kadir\nand Dawah, wild riders from Yashtavit, fierce savages from the jungles of\nShamir, where men and women fight side by side. They all come\nnorthwards. Coming here, to fight for the Emperor.”\n“So many, just to take Dagoska?”\n“And more besides. The Emperor has built himself a navy. One hundred\nsail of great ships.”\n“The Gurkish are no sailors. The Union controls the seas.”\n“The world changes, and you must change with it or be swept aside.\nThis war will not be like the last. Khalul finally sends forth his own"

Khalul finally sends forth his own\nsoldiers. An army many long years in the making. The gates of the great\ntemple-fortress of Sarkant are opening, high in the barren mountains. I have\nseen it. Mamun comes forth, thrice-blessed and thrice-cursed, the fruit of\nthe desert, first apprentice of Khalul. Together they broke the Second Law,\ntogether they ate the flesh of men. The Hundred Words come behind, Eaters\nall, disciples of the Prophet, bred for battle and fed over these long years,\nadepts in the disciplines of arms and of High Art. No peril like it has faced\nthe world since the Old Time, when Juvens fought with Kanedias. Since\nbefore that, perhaps, when Glustrod touched the Other Side, and sought to\nopen the gates to the world below.”\nAnd blah, blah, blah. A shame. He had been making surprising sense for\na Magus. “You want to give me information? Keep your bedtime stories\nand tell me what happened to Davoust.”\n“There is an Eater here. I smell it. A dweller in the shadows. One whose\nonly task is to destroy those who oppose the Prophet.” And myself the first\nof them? “Your predecessor never left these chambers. The Eater took him,\nto protect the traitor who works within the city.”\nYes. Now we speak my language. “Who is the traitor?” Glokta’s voice\nsounded shrill, sharp, greedy in his own ear.\n“I am no fortune-teller, cripple, and if I could give you the answer,\nwould you believe me? Men must learn at their own pace.”\n“Bah!” snapped Glokta. “You are just like Bayaz. You talk, and talk, and\nyet you say nothing. Eaters? Nothing but old stories and nonsense!”\n“Stories? Did Bayaz not take you within the Maker’s House?” Glokta\nswallowed, his hand clinging, trembling, tight to the damp stone under the\nwindow. “Yet still you doubt me? You are slow to learn, cripple. Have I not\nseen the slaves march to Sarkant, dragged from every land the Gurkish\nconquer? Have I not seen the countless columns, driven up into the\nmountains? To feed Khalul and his disciples, to swell their power ever\nfurther. A crime against God! A breach of the Second Law, written in fire by\nEuz himself! You doubt me, and perhaps you are wise to doubt me, but at\nfirst light you will see the Gurkish have come. You will count five\nstandards, and you will know I spoke the truth.”\n“Who is the traitor?” hissed Glokta. “Tell me, you riddling bastard!”\nSilence, but for the splashing of rain, the trickling of water, the rustling of\nwind in the hangings about the window.

They\nmoved together in perfect formation to the deep thumping of great drums,\nrank upon rigid rank, the sound of their tramping boots like the distant\nthunder of the night before. Already, the sun had sucked away all evidence\nof the rain, and now it flashed mirror-bright on thousands of helmets,\nthousands of shields, thousands of swords, glittering arrowheads, coats of\narmour. A forest of shining spears, moving inexorably forward. A merciless,\ntireless, irresistible tide of men.\nUnion soldiers were scattered around the top of the land walls, squatting\nbehind the parapet, fingering their flatbows, peering out nervously at the\nadvancing host. Glokta could sense their fear. And who can blame them? We\nmust be outnumbered ten to one already. There were no drums up here in\nthe wind, no shouted orders, no hurried preparations. Only silence.\n“And here they come,” mused Nicomo Cosca, grinning out at the scene.\nHe alone seemed untouched by fear. He has either an iron nerve or a\nleaden imagination. Lazing in a drinking-hole or waiting for death all\nseems to be one to him. He was standing with one foot up on the parapet,\nforearms crossed on his knee, half-full bottle dangling from one hand. The\nmercenary’s battle dress was much the same as his drinking gear. The same\nsagging boots, the same ruined trousers. His one allowance for the dangers\nof the battlefield was a black breastplate, etched front and back with golden\nscrollwork. It too had seen better days, the enamel chipped, the rivets\nstained with rust. But it must once have been quite the masterpiece.\n“That’s a fine piece of armour you have there.”\n“What, this?” Cosca looked down at his breastplate. “In its day, perhaps,\nbut it’s seen some hard use over the years. Been left out in the rain more\nthan once. A gift from the Grand Duchess Sefeline of Ospria, in return for\ndefeating the army of Sipani in the five-month war. It came with a promise\nof her eternal friendship.”\n“Nice, to have friends.”\n“Not really. That very night she tried to have me killed. My victories had\nmade me far too popular with Sefeline’s own subjects. She feared I might\ntry to seize power. Poison, in my wine.” Cosca took a long swig from his\nbottle. “Killed my favourite mistress. I was forced to flee, with little more\nthan this damn breastplate, and seek employment with the Prince of Sipani.\nThat old bastard didn’t pay half so well, but at least I got to lead his army\nagainst the Duchess, and have the satisfaction of seeing her poisoned in her\nturn.” He frowned. “Made her face turn blue. Bright blue, believe me.\nNever get too popular, that’s my advice.”\nGlokta snorted. “Overpopularity is scarcely my most pressing worry.”\nVissbruck cleared his throat noisily, evidently upset at being ignored. He\ngestured towards the endless ranks of men advancing down the isthmus."

He\ngestured towards the endless ranks of men advancing down the isthmus.\n“Superior, the Gurkish approach.” Indeed? I had not noticed. “Do I have\nyour permission to flood the ditch?”\nOh yes, your moment of glory. “Very well.”\nVissbruck strutted to the parapet with an air of the greatest self-\nimportance. He slowly raised his arm, then chopped it portentously through\nthe air. Somewhere, out of sight below, whips cracked and teams of mules\nstrained on ropes. The complaining squeal of wood under great pressure\nreached them on the battlements, then a creaking and a cracking as the\ndams gave way, and then an angry thundering as the great weight of salt\nwater broke through and surged down the deep ditch from both ends,\nfoaming angry white. Water met water just beneath them, throwing\nglittering spray into the air as high as the battlements and higher yet. A\nmoment later, and this new ribbon of sea was calm. The ditch had become a\nchannel, the city had become an island.\n“The ditch is flooded!” announced General Vissbruck.\n“So we see,” said Glokta. “Congratulations.” Let us hope the Gurkish\nhave no strong swimmers among them. They certainly have no shortage of\nmen to choose from.\nFive tall poles waved gently above the tramping mass of soldiers,\nGurkish symbols glittering upon them in solid gold. Symbols of battles\nfought, and battles won. The standards of five legions, flashing in the\nmerciless sun. Five legions. Just as the old man told me. Will ships follow,\nthen? Glokta turned his head and peered out across the Lower City. The\nlong wharves stuck into the bay like the spines of a hedgehog, still busy\nwith ships. Ships carrying our supplies in, and a last few nervous merchants\nout. There were no walls there. Few defences of any kind. We did not think\nwe needed them. The Union has always ruled the seas. If ships should\ncome…\n“Do we still have supplies of wood and stone?”\nThe General nodded vigorously, all eagerness. Finally adjusted to the\nchanges in the chain of command, it seems. “Abundant supplies, Superior,\nprecisely as your orders specified.”\n“I want you to build a wall behind the docks and along the shoreline. As\nstrong, and as high, and as soon as possible. Our defences there are weak.\nThe Gurkish may test them sooner or later.”\nThe General frowned out at the swarming army of soldiers crawling\nover the peninsula, looked down towards the calm docks, and back. “But\nsurely the threat from the landward side is a little more… pressing? The\nGurkish are poor sailors, and in any case have no fleet worthy of the name\n—”\n“The world changes, General. The world changes.”\n“Of course.” Vissbruck turned to speak to his aides.\nGlokta shuffled up to the parapet beside Cosca. “How many Gurkish\ntroops, would you judge?”\nThe Styrian scratched at the flaky rash on the side of his neck. “I count\nfive standards. Five of the Emperor’s legions, and plenty more besides."

        "text": "troops, would you judge?”\nThe Styrian scratched at the flaky rash on the side of his neck. “I count\nfive standards. Five of the Emperor’s legions, and plenty more besides.\nScouts, engineers, irregulars from across the South. How many troops…”\nHe squinted up into the sun, lips moving silently as though his head was full\nof complex sums. “A fucking lot.” He tipped his head back and sucked the\nlast drops from his bottle, then he smacked his lips, pulled back his arm,\nand hurled it towards the Gurkish. It flashed in the sun for a moment, then\nshattered against the hard dirt on the other side of the channel. “Do you see\nthose carts at the back?”\nGlokta squinted down his eye-glass. There did indeed seem to be a\nshadowy column of great wagons behind the mass of soldiery, barely\nvisible in the shimmering haze and the clouds of dust kicked up by the\nstomping boots. Soldiers need supplies of course, but then again… Here\nand there he could see long timbers sticking up like spider’s legs. “Siege\nengines,” muttered Glokta to himself. All just as Yulwei said. “They are in\nearnest.”\n“Ah, but so are you.” Cosca stood up beside the parapet, started to fiddle\nwith his belt. A moment later, Glokta heard the sound of his piss spattering\nagainst the base of the wall, far below. The mercenary grinned over his\nshoulder, thin hair fluttering in the salt wind. “Everyone’s in lots of earnest.\nI must speak to Magister Eider. I’d say I’ll be getting my battle money\nsoon.”\n“I think so.” Glokta slowly lowered his eye-glass. “And earning it too.”\nThe Blind Lead the Blind\nT\nhe First of the Magi lay twisted on his back in the cart, wedged between\na water barrel and a sack of horse feed, a coil of rope for his pillow. Logen\nhad never seen him look so old, and thin, and weak. His breath came\nshallow, his skin was pale and blotchy, drawn tight over his bones and\nbeaded with sweat. From time to time he’d twitch, and squirm, and mutter\nstrange words, his eyelids flickering like a man trapped in a bad dream.\n“What happened?”\nQuai stared down. “Whenever you use the Art, you borrow from the\nOther Side, and what is borrowed has to be repaid. There are risks, even for\na master. To seek to change the world with a thought… the arrogance of it.”\nThe corners of his mouth twitched up into a smile. “Borrow too often,\nperhaps, one time you touch the world below, and leave a piece of yourself\nbehind…”\n“Behind?” muttered Logen, peering down at the twitching old man. He\ndidn’t much like the way Quai was talking. It was no smiling matter, as far\nas he could see, to be stuck out in the middle of nowhere without a clue\nwhere they were going.\n“Just think,” whispered the apprentice. “The First of the Magi himself,\nhelpless as a baby.” He laid his hand gently on Bayaz’s chest. “He clings on"

I could reach out now, with this weak hand… and kill\nhim.”\nLogen frowned. “Why would you want to do that?”\nQuai looked up, and smiled his sickly smile. “Why would anyone? I was\nmerely saying.” And he snatched his hand away.\n“How long will he stay like this?”\nThe apprentice sat back in the cart and stared up at the sky. “There’s no\nsaying. Maybe hours. Maybe forever.”\n“Forever?” Logen ground his teeth. “Where does that leave us? You\nhave any idea where we’re going? Or why? Or what we do when we get\nthere? Should we turn back?”\n“No.” Quai’s face was sharp as a blade. Sharper than Logen would ever\nhave expected from him. “We have enemies behind us. To turn back now\nwould be more dangerous than to continue. We carry on.”\nLogen winced, and rubbed at his eyes. He felt tired, and sore, and sick.\nHe wished he’d asked Bayaz his plans when he’d had the chance. He\nwished he’d never left the North, if it came to that. He could have sought\nout a reckoning with Bethod, and died in a place he knew, at the hands of\nmen that he at least understood.\nLogen had no wish to lead. The time was he’d hungered after fame, and\nglory, and respect, but the winning of them had been costly, and they’d\nproved to be hollow prizes. Men had put their faith in him, and he’d led\nthem by a painful and a bloody route straight back to the mud. There was no\nambition in him anymore. He was cursed when it came to making\ndecisions.\nHe took his hands away and looked around him. Bayaz still lay\nmuttering in his fevered sleep. Quai was gazing carelessly up at the clouds.\nLuthar was standing with his back to the others, staring down the gorge.\nFerro was sitting on a rock, cleaning her bow with a rag, and scowling.\nLongfoot had reappeared, predictably, just as the danger ended, and was\nstanding not far away, looking pleased with himself. Logen grimaced, and\ngave a long sigh. There was no help for it. There was no one else.\n“Alright, we head for this bridge, at Aulcus, then we see.”\n“Not a good idea,” tutted Longfoot, wandering up to the cart and peering\nin. “Not a good idea in the least. I warned our employer of that before his…\nmishap. The city is deserted, destroyed, ruined. A blighted, and a broken,\nand a dangerous place. The bridge may still stand, but according to rumour\n—”\n“Aulcus was the plan, and I reckon we’ll stick with it.”\nLongfoot carried on as though he hadn’t spoken. “I think, perhaps, that it\nwould be best if we headed back towards Calcis. We are still less than\nhalfway to our ultimate destination, and have ample food and water for the\nreturn journey. With some luck—”"

With some luck—”\n“You were paid to go all the way?”\n“Well, er, indeed I was, but—”\n“Aulcus.”\nThe Navigator blinked. “Well, yes, I see that you are decided.\nDecisiveness, and boldness, and vigour, it would seem, are among your\ntalents, but caution, and wisdom, and experience, if I may say, are among\nmine, and I am in no doubt whatsoever that—”\n“Aulcus,” growled Logen.\nLongfoot paused with his mouth half open. Then he snapped it shut.\n“Very well. We will follow the road back onto the plains, and head\nwestwards to the three lakes. Aulcus is at their head, but the journey is still\na long and dangerous one, especially with winter well upon us. There\nshould be—”\n“Good.” Logen turned away before the Navigator had the chance to say\nanything more. That was the easy part. He sucked his teeth, and walked\nover to Ferro.\n“Bayaz is…” he struggled for the right word. “Out. We don’t know how\nlong for.”\nShe nodded. “We going on?”\n“Er… I reckon… that’s the plan.”\n“Alright.” She got up from her rock and slung the bow over her\nshoulder. “Best get moving, then.”\nEasier than he’d expected. Too easy, perhaps. He wondered if she was\nthinking of sneaking off again. He was considering it himself, truth be told.\n“I don’t even know where we’re going.”\nShe snorted. “I’ve never known where I was going. You ask me, it’s an\nimprovement, you in charge.” She walked off towards the horses. “I never\ntrusted that bald bastard.”\nAnd that only left Luthar. He was standing with his back to the others,\nshoulders slumped, thoroughly miserable-looking. Logen could see the\nmuscles on the side of his head working as he stared at the ground.\n“You alright?”\nLuthar hardly seemed to hear him. “I wanted to fight. I wanted to, and I\nknew how to, and I had my hand on my steels.” He slapped angrily at the\nhilt of one of his swords. “I was helpless as a fucking baby! Why couldn’t I\nmove?”\n“That it? By the dead, boy, that happens to some men the first time!”\n“It does?”\n“More than you’d believe. At least you didn’t shit yourself.”\nLuthar raised his eyebrows. “That happens?”\n“More than you’d believe.”\n“Did you freeze up, the first time?”\nLogen frowned. “No. Killing comes too easy to me. Always has done.\nBelieve me, you’re the lucky one.”\n“Unless I’m killed for doing nothing.”\n“Well,” Logen had to admit, “there is that.” Luthar’s head dropped even\nlower, and Logen clapped him on the arm. “But you didn’t get killed!

Logen slid his arm round his shoulder and guided him back towards\nthe horses. “Then you’ve got the chance to do better next time.”\n“Next time?”\n“’Course. Doing better next time. That’s what life is.”\nLogen climbed back into the saddle, stiff and sore. Stiff from all the\nriding, sore from the fight in the gorge. Some bit of rock had cracked him\non the back, that and he’d got a good punch on the side of his head. Could\nhave been a lot worse.\nHe looked round at the others. They were all mounted up, staring at him.\nFour faces, as different as could be, but all with the same expression, more\nor less. Waiting for his say. Why did anyone ever think he had the answers?\nHe swallowed, and dug his heels in.\n“Let’s go.”\nPrince Ladisla’s Stratagem\nY\nou really should spend less time in here, Colonel West.” Pike set down\nhis hammer for a moment, the orange light from his forge reflecting in his\neyes, shining bright on his melted face. “People will start to talk.”\nWest cracked a nervous grin. “It’s the only warm place in the whole\ndamn camp.” It was true enough, but a long way from the real reason. It\nwas the only place in the whole damn camp where no one would look for\nhim. Men who were starving, men who were freezing, men who had no\nwater, or no weapon, or no clue what they were doing. Men who’d died of\ncold or illness and needed burying. Even the dead couldn’t manage without\nWest. Everyone needed him, day and night. Everyone except Pike and his\ndaughter, and the rest of the convicts. They alone seemed self-sufficient,\nand so their forge had become his refuge. A noisy, and a crowded, and a\nsmoky refuge, no doubt, but no less sweet for that. He preferred it\nimmeasurably to being with the Prince and his staff. Here among the\ncriminals it was more… honest.\n“You’re in the way, Colonel. Again.” Cathil shoved past him, a knife-\nblade glowing orange in the tongs in one gloved hand. She shoved it into\nthe water, frowning, turning it this way and that while steam hissed up\naround her. West watched her move, quick and practised, beads of moisture\non her sinewy arm, the back of her neck, hair dark and spiky with sweat.\nHard to believe he’d ever taken her for a boy. She might handle the metal as\nwell as any of the men, but the shape of her face, not to mention her chest,\nher waist, the curve of her backside, all unmistakably female…\nShe glanced over her shoulder and caught him looking. “Don’t you have\nan army to run?”\n“They’ll last ten minutes without me.”\nShe drew the cold, black blade from the water and tossed it clattering\nonto the heap beside the whetstone. “You sure?”\nMaybe she was right at that. West took a deep breath, sighed, turned\nwith some reluctance, and ventured out through the door of the shed and\ninto the camp.\nThe winter air nipped at his cheeks after the heat of the smithy, and he"

        "text": "with some reluctance, and ventured out through the door of the shed and\ninto the camp.\nThe winter air nipped at his cheeks after the heat of the smithy, and he\npulled up the collars of his coat, hugged himself as he struggled down the\ncamp’s main road. It was deathly quiet out here at night, once he had left\nthe rattling of the forge behind him. He could hear the frozen mud sucking\nat his boots, his breath rasping in his throat, the faint cursing of some\ndistant soldier, grumbling his way through the darkness. He stopped a\nmoment and looked up, arms folded round himself for warmth. The sky was\nperfectly clear, the stars prickling bright, spread across the blackness like\nshining dust.\n“Beautiful,” he murmured to himself.\n“You get used to it.”\nIt was Threetrees, picking his way between the tents with the Dogman at\nhis shoulder. His face was in shadow, all dark pits and white angles like a\ncliff in the moonlight, but West could tell there was some ill news coming.\nThe old Northman could hardly have been described as a figure of fun at the\nbest of times, but now his frown was grim indeed.\n“Well met,” said West in the Northern tongue.\n“You think? Bethod is inside five days’ march of your camp.”\nThe cold seemed suddenly to cut through West’s coat and make him\nshiver. “Five days?”\n“If he’s stayed put since we saw him, and that ain’t likely. Bethod was\nnever one for staying put. If he’s marching south, he could be three days\naway. Less even.”\n“What are his numbers?”\nThe Dogman licked his lips, breath smoking round his lean face in the\nchill air. “I’d guess at ten thousand, but he might have more behind.”\nWest felt colder yet. “Ten thousand? That many?”\n“Around ten, aye. Mostly Thralls.”\n“Thralls? Light infantry?”\n“Light, but not like this rubbish you have here.” Threetrees scowled\naround at the shabby tents, the badly built campfires, close to guttering out.\n“Bethod’s Thralls are lean and bloody from battles and tough as wood from\nmarching. Those bastards can run all day and still fight at the end of it, if it’s\nneeded. Bowmen, spearmen, all well practised.”\n“There’s no shortage of Carls and all,” muttered the Dogman.\n“That there ain’t, with strong mail and good blades, and plenty of horses\ninto the bargain. There’ll be Named Men too, no doubt. It’s the pick of the\ncrop Bethod’s brought with him, and some sharp war leaders in amongst\n’em. That and some strange folk from out east. Wild men, from beyond the\nCrinna. Must have left a few boys dotted about up north, for your friends to\nchase around after, and brought his best fighters south with him, against\nyour weakest.” The old warrior stared grimly round at the slovenly camp\nfrom under his thick eyebrows. “No offence, but I don’t give you a shit of a\nchance if it comes to a battle.”\nThe worst of all outcomes. West swallowed. “How fast could such an\narmy move?”\n“Fast. Their scouts might be with us day after tomorrow. Main body a"

Main body a\nday later. If they’ve come right on, that is, and it’s hard to say if they will.\nWouldn’t put it past Bethod to try and cross the river lower down, come\nround behind us.”\n“Behind us?” They were scarcely equipped for a predictable enemy.\n“How could he have known we were here?”\n“Bethod always had a gift for guessing out his enemies. Good sense for\nit. That and he’s a lucky bastard. Loves to take chances. Ain’t nothing more\nimportant in war than a good slice o’ luck.”\nWest looked around him, blinking. Ten thousand battle-hardened\nNorthmen, descending on their ramshackle camp. Lucky, unpredictable\nNorthmen. He imagined trying to turn the ill-disciplined levies, up to their\nankles in mud, trying to get them to form a line. It would be a slaughter.\nAnother Black Well in the making. But at least they had a warning. Three\ndays to prepare their defences, or better still, to begin to retreat.\n“We must speak to the Prince at once,” he said.\nS\noft music and warm light washed out into the chill night air as West\njerked back the tent flap. He stooped through, reluctantly, with the two\nNorthmen close behind him.\n“By the dead…” muttered Threetrees, gaping round.\nWest had forgotten how bizarre the Prince’s quarters must appear to a\nnewcomer, especially one who was a stranger to luxury. It was less a tent\nthan a huge hall of purple cloth, ten strides or more in height, hung with\nStyrian tapestries and floored with Kantic carpets. The furniture would have\nbeen more in keeping in a palace than a camp. Huge carved dressers and\ngilt chests held the Prince’s endless wardrobe, enough to clothe an army of\ndandies. The bed was a gargantuan four-poster, bigger than most tents in the\ncamp on its own. A highly polished table in one corner sagged under the\nweight of heaped-up delicacies, silver and gold plate twinkling in the\ncandlelight. One could hardly imagine that only a few hundred strides away,\nmen were cramped, and cold, and had not enough to eat.\nCrown Prince Ladisla himself sat sprawled in a huge chair of dark wood,\na throne, one could have said, upholstered in red silk. An empty glass\ndangled from one hand, while the other waved back and forth to the music\nof a quartet of expert musicians, plucking, fiddling, and blowing gently at\ntheir shining instruments in the far corner. Around His Highness were four\nof his staff, impeccably dressed and fashionably bored, among them the\nyoung Lord Smund, who had perhaps become, over the past few weeks,\nWest’s least favourite person in the entire world.\n“It does you great credit,” Smund was braying loudly to the Prince.\n“Sharing the hardships of the camp has always been a fine way to win the\nrespect of the common soldier—”\n“Ah, Colonel West!” chirped Ladisla. “And two of his Northern scouts!\nWhat a delight!

You must take some food!” He made a floppy, drunken\ngesture towards the table.\n“Thank you, Your Highness, but I have eaten. I have some news of the\ngreatest—”\n“Or some wine! You must all have wine, this is an excellent vintage!\nWhere did that bottle get to?” He fumbled about beneath his chair.\nThe Dogman had already crossed to the table and was leaning over it,\nsniffing at the food like… a dog. He snatched a large slice of beef from the\nplate with his dirty fingers, folded it carefully and stuffed it whole into his\nmouth, while Smund looked on, lip curled with contempt. It would have\nbeen embarrassing, under normal circumstances, but West had larger\nworries.\n“Bethod is within five days’ march of us,” he nearly shouted, “with the\nbest part of his strength!”\nOne of the musicians fumbled his bow and hit a screeching, discordant\nnote. Ladisla jerked his head up, nearly sliding from his seat. Even Smund\nand his companions were pulled from their indolence.\n“Five days,” muttered the Prince, his voice hoarse with excitement, “are\nyou sure?”\n“Perhaps no more than three.”\n“How many are they?”\n“As many as ten thousand, and veterans to a—”\n“Excellent!” Ladisla slapped the arm of his chair as if it were a\nNorthman’s face. “We are on equal terms with them!”\nWest swallowed. “Perhaps in numbers, Your Highness, but not in\nquality.”\n“Come now, Colonel West,” droned Smund. “One good Union man is\nworth ten of their kind.” He stared down his nose at Threetrees.\n“Black Well proved that notion a fantasy, even if our men were properly\nfed, trained, and equipped. Aside from the King’s Own, they are none of\nthese things! We would be well advised to prepare defences, and make\nready to withdraw if we must.”\nSmund snorted his contempt for that idea. “There is nothing more\ndangerous in war,” he disclaimed airily, “than too much caution.”\n“Except too little!” growled West, the fury already starting to pulse\nbehind his eyes.\nBut Prince Ladisla cut him off before he had the chance to lose his\ntemper. “Gentlemen, enough!” He sprang up from his chair, eyes dewy with\ndrunken enthusiasm. “I have already decided on my strategy! We will cross\nthe river and intercept these savages! They think to surprise us? Hah!” He\nlashed at the air with his wineglass. “We will give them a surprise they will\nnot soon forget! Drive them back over the border! Just as Marshal Burr\nintended!”\n“But, Your Highness,” stammered West, feeling slightly queasy, “the\nLord Marshal explicitly ordered that we remain behind the river—”\nLadisla flicked his head, as though bothered by a fly. “The spirit of his\norders, Colonel, not the letter! He can hardly complain if we take the fight\nto our enemy!”\n“These men are fucking fools,” rumbled Threetrees, luckily in the\nNorthern tongue."

He can hardly complain if we take the fight\nto our enemy!”\n“These men are fucking fools,” rumbled Threetrees, luckily in the\nNorthern tongue.\n“What did he say?” inquired the Prince.\n“Er… he concurs with me that we should hold here, Your Highness, and\nsend to Lord Marshal Burr for help.”\n“Does he indeed? And I thought these Northmen were all fire and\nvinegar! Well, Colonel West, you may inform him that I am resolved on an\nattack, and cannot be moved! We will show this so-called King of the\nNorthmen that he does not hold a monopoly on victory!”\n“Good show!” shouted Smund, stamping his foot on the thick carpet.\n“Excellent!” The rest of the Prince’s staff voiced their ignorant support.\n“Kick them back across the border!”\n“Teach them a lesson!”\n“Excellent! Capital! Is there more wine?”\nWest clenched his fists with frustration. He had to make one more effort,\nhowever embarrassing, however pointless. He dropped to one knee, he\nclasped his hands together, he fixed the Prince with his eye and gathered\nevery ounce of persuasiveness he possessed. “Your Highness, I ask you, I\nentreat you, I beg you to reconsider. The lives of every man in this camp\ndepend on your decision.”\nThe Prince grinned. “Such is the weight of command, my friend! I\nrealise your motives are of the best, but I must agree with Lord Smund.\nBoldness is the best policy in war, and boldness shall be my strategy! It was\nthrough boldness that Harod the Great forged the Union, through boldness\nthat King Casamir conquered Angland in the first place! We will get the\nbetter of these Northmen yet, you’ll see. Give the orders, Colonel! We\nmarch at first light!”\nWest had studied Casamir’s campaigns in detail. Boldness had been one-\ntenth of his success, the rest had been meticulous planning, care for his\nmen, attention to every detail. Boldness without the rest was apt to be\ndeadly, but he saw that it was pointless to say so. He would only anger the\nPrince and lose whatever influence he might still have. He felt like a man\nwatching his own house burn down. Numb, sick, utterly helpless. There was\nnothing left for him to do but to give the orders, and do his best to see that\neverything was conducted as well as it could be.\n“Of course, Your Highness,” he managed to mutter.\n“Of course!” The Prince grinned. “We are all in agreement, then!\nCapital! Stop that music!” he shouted at the musicians. “We need something\nwith more vigour! Something with blood in it!” The quartet switched\neffortlessly to a jaunty martial theme. West turned, limbs heavy with\nhopelessness, and trudged out of the tent into the icy night.\nThreetrees was hard on his heels. “By the dead, but I can’t work you\npeople out! Where I come from, a man earns the right to lead! His men\nfollow because they know his quality, and respect him because he shares\ntheir hardships with ’em!

He could hardly deny it.\n“That prick’ll march the lot o’ you right into your fucking graves! Back\nto the mud with you all, but I’m damned if I’ll follow, or any of my boys.\nI’m done paying for other folks’ mistakes, and I’ve lost enough to that\nbastard Bethod already! Come on, Dogman. This boat o’ fools can sink\nwithout us!” And he turned and stalked away into the night.\nThe Dogman shrugged. “Ain’t all bad.” He closed to a conspiratorial\ndistance, reached deep into his pocket and pulled something out. West\nstared down at an entire poached salmon, no doubt pilfered from the\nPrince’s table. The Northman grinned. “I got me a fish!” And he followed\nhis chief, leaving West alone on the bitter hillside, Ladisla’s martial music\nfloating through the chill air behind him.\nUntil Sunset\nO\ny.” A rough hand shook Glokta from his sleep. He rolled his head\ngingerly from the side he had been sleeping on, clenching his teeth at the\npain as his neck clicked. Does death come early in the morning, today? He\nopened his eyes a crack. Ah. Not quite yet, it seems. Perhaps at lunchtime.\nVitari stared down at him, spiky hair silhouetted black in the early morning\nsun streaming through the window.\n“Very well, Practical Vitari, if you really can’t resist me. You’ll have to\ngo on top, though, if you don’t mind.”\n“Ha ha. The Gurkish ambassador is here.”\n“The what?”\n“An emissary. From the Emperor himself, I hear.”\nGlokta felt a stab of panic. “Where?”\n“Here in the Citadel. Speaking to the ruling council.”\n“Shit on it!” snarled Glokta, scrambling out of bed, ignoring the\nstabbing pain in his leg as he swung his ruined left foot onto the floor.\n“Why didn’t they call for me?”\nVitari scowled down at him. “Maybe they preferred to talk to him\nwithout you. You think that could be it?”\n“How the hell did he get here?”\n“He came in by boat, under sign of parley. Vissbruck says he was duty\nbound to admit him.”\n“Duty bound!” spat Glokta as he struggled to pull his trousers up his\nnumb and trembling leg. “That fat fucker! How long has he been here?”\n“Long enough for him and the council to make some pretty mischief\ntogether, if that’s their aim.”\n“Shit!” Glokta winced as he shrugged his shirt on.\nT\nhe Gurkish ambassador was, without doubt, a majestic presence.\nHis nose was prominent and hooked, his eyes burned bright with\nintelligence, his long, thin beard was neatly brushed.

The miserable\ncrow faces the magnificent peacock. Still, battles are not always won by the\nmost beautiful. Fortunately for me.\nThe long table was surprisingly empty. Only Vissbruck, Eider, and\nKorsten dan Vurms were in their seats, and none of them looked pleased to\nsee him arrive.

I must apologise for my late arrival,\nbut no one told me you were coming.” He looked daggers at Vissbruck, but\nthe General was not interested in meeting his eye. That’s right, you\nblustering fool. I won’t forget this.\n“My name is Shabbed al Islik Burai.” The ambassador spoke the\ncommon tongue perfectly, in a voice every bit as powerful, as authoritative,\nas arrogant as his bearing. “I come as emissary from the rightful ruler of all\nthe South, mighty Emperor of mighty Gurkhul and all the Kantic lands,\nUthman-ul-Dosht, loved, feared, and favoured above all other men within\nthe Circle of the World, anointed by God’s right hand, the Prophet Khalul\nhimself.”\n“Good for you. I would bow, but I strained my back getting out of bed.”\nIslik gave a delicate sneer. “Truly a warrior’s injury. I have come to\naccept your surrender.”\n“Is that so?” Glokta dragged out the nearest chair and sank into it. I’m\ndamned if I’m going to stand a moment longer, just for the benefit of this\ntowering oaf. “I thought it was traditional to make such offers once the\nfighting is over.”\n“If there is to be fighting, it will not last long.” The ambassador swept\nacross the tiles to the window. “I see five legions, arrayed in battle order\nupon the peninsula. Twenty thousand spears, and they are but a fraction of\nwhat comes. The troops of the Emperor are more numerous than the grains\nof sand in the desert. To resist us would be as futile as to resist the tide. You\nall know this.” His eyes swept proudly across the guilty faces of the ruling\ncouncil and came to rest on Glokta’s with a piercing contempt. The look of\na man who believes he has already won. No one could blame him much for\nthinking so. Perhaps he has.\n“Only fools or madmen would choose to stand against such odds. You"

You\npinks have never belonged here. The Emperor offers you the chance to\nleave the South with your lives. Open the gates to us and you will be\nspared. You can leave on your little boats and float back to your little island.\nLet it never be said that Uthman-ul-Dosht is not generous. God fights beside\nus. Your cause is lost.”\n“Oh, I don’t know, we held our own in the last war. I’m sure we all\nremember the fall of Ulrioch. I know I do. The city burned brightly. The\ntemples especially.” Glokta shrugged. “God must have been elsewhere that\nday.”\n“That day, yes. But there were other battles. I am sure you also\nremember a certain engagement, at a certain bridge, where a certain young\nofficer fell into our hands.” The emissary smiled. “God is everywhere.”\nGlokta felt his eyelid flickering. He knows I am not likely to forget. He\nremembered his surprise as a Gurkish spear cut into his body. Surprise, and\ndisappointment, and the most intense pain. Not invulnerable, after all. He\nremembered his horse rearing, dumping him from the saddle. The pain\ngrowing worse, the surprise turning into fear. Crawling among the boots\nand the bodies, gasping for air, mouth sour with dust, salty with blood. He\nremembered the agony as the blades cut into his leg. The fear turning to\nterror. He remembered how they dragged him, screaming and crying, from\nthat bridge. That night they began to ask their questions.\n“We won,” said Glokta, but his mouth was dry, his voice was cracked.\n“We proved the stronger.”\n“That was then. The world changes. Your nation’s entanglements in the\nicy North put you at a most considerable disadvantage. You have managed\nto break the first rule of warfare. Never fight two enemies at once.”\nHis reasoning is hard to fault. “The walls of Dagoska have frustrated\nyou before,” Glokta said, but it did not sound convincing, even to his own\near. Hardly the words of a winner. He felt the eyes of Vurms, and Vissbruck,\nand Eider on him, making his back itch. Trying to decide who holds the\nupper hand, and I know who I’d pick in their shoes.\n“Perhaps some of you have more confidence in your walls than others. I\nwill return at sunset for your answer. The Emperor’s offer lasts for this one\nday only, and will never be repeated. He is merciful, but his mercy has\nlimits. You have until sunset.” And he swept from the room.\nGlokta waited until the door had clicked shut before he slowly turned his\nchair around to face the others. “What in hell was that?” he snarled at\nVissbruck.\n“Er…” The General tugged at his sweaty collar. “It was incumbent upon\nme, as a soldier, to admit an unarmed representative of the enemy, in order\nto hear his terms—”\n“Without telling me?”\n“We knew you would not want to listen!” snapped Vurms. “But he\nspeaks the truth! Despite all our hard work, we are greatly outnumbered,"

Despite all our hard work, we are greatly outnumbered,\nand can expect no relief as long as the war drags on in Angland. We are\nnothing more than a pinprick in the foot of a huge and hostile nation. It\nmight serve us well to negotiate while we still hold a position of some\nstrength. You may depend upon it that we will receive no terms beyond a\nmassacre once the city has fallen!”\nTrue enough, but the Arch Lector is unlikely to agree. Negotiating a\nsurrender was hardly the task for which I was appointed. “You are\nunusually quiet, Magister Eider.”\n“I am scarcely qualified to speak on the military aspects of such a\ndecision. But as it turns out, his terms are generous. One thing is certain. If\nwe refuse this offer, and the Gurkish do take the city by force, the slaughter\nwill be terrible.” She looked up at Glokta. “There will be no mercy then.”\nAll too true. On Gurkish mercy I am the expert. “So all three of you are\nfor capitulation?” They looked at each other, and said nothing. “It has not\noccurred to you that once we surrender, they might not honour your little\nagreement?”\n“It had occurred,” said Vissbruck, “but they have honoured their\nagreements before, and surely some hope”—he looked down at the tabletop\n—“is better than none.” You have more confidence in our enemy than in me,\nit would seem. Hardly that surprising. My own confidence could be higher.\nGlokta wiped some wet from under his eye. “I see. Then I suppose I\nmust consider his offer. We will reconvene when our Gurkish friend returns.\nAt sunset.” He rocked his body back and winced as he pushed himself up.\n“You’ll consider it?” hissed Vitari in his ear as he limped down the hall\naway from the audience chamber. “You’ll fucking consider it?”\n“That’s right,” snapped Glokta. “I make the decisions here.”\n“Or you let those worms make them for you!”\n“We’ve each got our jobs. I don’t tell you how to write your little reports\nto the Arch Lector. How I manage those worms is none of your concern.”\n“None of my concern?” Vitari snatched hold of Glokta’s arm and he\ntottered on his weak leg. She was stronger than she looked, a lot stronger. “I\ntold Sult you could handle things!” she snarled in his face. “If we lose the\ncity, without so much as a fight even, it’s both our heads! And my head is\nmy concern, cripple!”\n“This is no time to panic,” growled Glokta. “I don’t want to end up\nfloating in the docks any more than you do, but this is a delicate balance.\nLet them think they might get their way, then no one will make any rash\nmoves. Not until I’m good and ready. Understand me when I say, Practical,\nthat this will be the first and the last time that I explain myself to you.

Now\ntake your fucking hand off me.”\nHer hand did not let go, rather the fingers tightened, cutting into\nGlokta’s arm as hard as a vice. Her eyes narrowed, furious lines cut into her\nfreckled face at their corners. Might I have misjudged her? Might she be\nabout to cut my throat? He almost grinned at the thought. But Severard\nchose that moment to step out of the shadows further down the dim hall.\n“Look at the two of you,” he murmured as he padded towards them. “It\nalways amazes me, how love blooms in the least likely places, and between\nthe least likely people. A rose, forcing its way through the stony ground.”\nHe pressed his hands to his chest. “It warms my heart.”\n“Have we got him?”\n“Of course. Soon as he stepped out of the audience chamber.”\nVitari’s hand had gone limp, and Glokta brushed it off and began to\nshuffle towards the cells. “Why don’t you come with us?” he called over his\nshoulder, having to stop himself from rubbing the bruised flesh on his arm.\n“You can put this in your next report to Sult.”\nS\nhabbed al Islik Burai looked considerably less majestic sitting down.\nParticularly in a scarred, stained chair in one of the close and sweaty cells\nbeneath the Citadel.\n“Now, isn’t this better, to speak on level terms? Quite disconcerting,\nhaving you looming over me like that.” Islik sneered and looked away, as\nthough talking to Glokta were a task far beneath him. A rich man, harassed\nby beggars in the street, but we’ll soon cure him of that illusion.\n“We know we have a traitor within our walls. Within the ruling council\nitself. Most likely one of those three worthies to whom you were just now\ngiving your little ultimatum. You will tell me who.” No response. “I am\nmerciful,” exclaimed Glokta, waving his hand airily, as the ambassador\nhimself had done but a few short minutes before, “but my mercy has limits.\nSpeak.”\n“I am here under a flag of parley, on a mission from the Emperor\nhimself! To harm an unarmed emissary would be expressly against the rules\nof war!”\n“Parley? Rules of war?” Glokta chuckled. Severard chuckled. Vitari\nchuckled. Frost was silent. “Do they even have those anymore? Save that\nrubbish for children like Vissbruck, that’s not the way grown-ups play the\ngame. Who is the traitor?”\n“I pity you, cripple! When the city falls—”\nSave your pity. You’ll need it for yourself. Frost’s fist scarcely made any\nsound as it sank into the ambassador’s stomach. His eyes bulged out, his\nmouth hung open, he coughed a dry cough, somewhere close to vomiting,\ntried to breathe, and coughed again.\n“Strange, isn’t it,” mused Glokta as he watched him struggle for air.\n“Big men, small men, thin men, fat men, clever men, stupid men, they all\nrespond the same to a fist in the guts.

The next you can’t even breathe by yourself.\nSome kinds of power are nothing but tricks of the mind. Your people taught\nme that, below your Emperor’s palace. There were no rules of war there, I\ncan tell you. You know all about certain engagements, and certain bridges,\nand certain young officers, so you know that I’ve been just where you are\nnow. There is one difference, however. I was helpless, but you can stop this\nunpleasantness at any time. You need only tell me who the traitor is, and\nyou will be spared.”\nIslik had got his breath back now. Though a good deal of his arrogance\nis gone, one suspects for good. “I know nothing of any traitor!”\n“Really? Your master the Emperor sends you here to negotiate without\nall the facts? Unlikely. But if it’s true, you really aren’t any use to me at all,\nare you?”\nIslik swallowed. “I know nothing of any traitor.”\n“We’ll see.”\nFrost’s big white fist clubbed him in the face. It would have thrown him\nsideways if the albino’s other fist hadn’t caught his head before it fell,\nsmashed his nose, and knocked him clean over the back of the chair. Frost\nand Severard dragged him up between them, righted the chair and dumped\nhim gasping into it. Vitari looked on, arms folded.\n“All very painful,” said Glokta, “but pain can be put to one side, if one\nknows that it will not last long. If it cannot last, say, past sunset. To truly\nbreak a man quickly, you have to threaten to deprive him of something. To\nhurt him in a way that will never heal. I should know.”\n“Gah!” squawked the ambassador, thrashing in his chair. Severard wiped\nhis knife on the shoulder of the man’s white robe, then tossed his ear onto\nthe table. It lay there, on the wood: a forlorn and bloody half circle of flesh.\nGlokta stared at it. In a baking cell just like this, over the course of long\nmonths, the Emperor’s servants turned me into this revolting, twisted\nmockery of a man. One might have hoped that the chance at doing the same\nto one of them, the chance at cutting out vengeance, pound for pound,\nwould provide some dull flicker of pleasure. And yet he felt nothing.\nNothing but my own pain. He winced as he stretched his leg out and felt the\nknee click, hissed air through his empty gums. So why do I do this?\nGlokta sighed. “Next will come a toe. Then a finger, an eye, a hand, your\nnose, and so on, do you see? It’ll be at least an hour before you’re missed,\nand we are quick workers.” Glokta nodded at the severed ear. “We could\nhave a pile of your flesh a foot high by that time. I’ll carve you until you’re\nnothing but a tongue and a bag of guts, if that’s what it takes, but I’ll know"

Do you know anything yet?”\nThe ambassador stared at him, breathing hard, dark blood running from\nhis magnificent nose, down his chin, dripping from the side of his head.\nSpeechless with shock, or thinking on his next move? It hardly matters. “I\ngrow bored. Start on his hands, Frost.” The albino seized hold of his wrist.\n“Wait!” wailed the ambassador, “God help me, wait! It was Vurms.\nKorsten dan Vurms, the governor’s own son!”\nVurms. Almost too obvious. But then again, the most obvious answers\nare usually the right ones. That little bastard would sell his own father if he\nonly thought that he could find a buyer—\n“And the woman, Eider!”\nGlokta frowned. “Eider? You sure?”\n“She planned it! She planned the whole thing!” Glokta sucked slowly at\nhis empty gums. They tasted sour. An awful sense of disappointment, or an\nawful sense of having known all along? She was always the only one with\nthe brains, or the guts, or the resources, for treason. A shame. But we know\nbetter than to hope for happy endings.\n“Eider and Vurms,” muttered Glokta. “Vurms and Eider. Our sordid\nlittle mystery comes to a close.” He looked up at Frost. “You know what to\ndo.”\nLong Odds\nT\nhe hill rose out of the grass, a round, even cone like a thing man-made.\nStrange, this one great mound standing out in the midst of the level plain.\nFerro did not trust it.\nWeathered stones stood in a rough circle around its top and scattered\nabout the slopes, some up on end, some lying on their sides, the smallest no\nmore than knee high, the biggest twice as tall as a man. Dark, bare stones,\nstanding defiant against the wind. Ancient, cold, angry. Ferro frowned at\nthem.\nIt felt as though they frowned back.\n“What is this place?” asked Ninefingers.\nQuai shrugged. “Old is what this place is, terribly old. Older than the\nEmpire itself. Built before the time of Euz, perhaps, when devils roamed the\nearth.” He grinned. “Built by devils, for all I know. Who can say? Some\ntemple to forgotten gods? Some tomb?”\n“Our tomb,” whispered Ferro.\n“What?”\n“Good place to stop,” she said out loud. “Get a look across the plain.”\nNinefingers frowned up at it. “Alright. We stop.”\nF\nerro stood on one of the stones, hands on hips, staring out across the plain\nthrough narrowed eyes. The wind tore at the grass and made waves from it,\nlike the waves on the sea. It tore at the great clouds too, twisting them,\nripping them open, dragging them through the sky. It lashed at Ferro’s face,\nnipped at her eyes, but she ignored it.\nDamn wind, just like always.\nNinefingers stood beside her, squinting into the cold sun. “Anything out\nthere?”"

You surprised?”\n“No.” He gave up looking and rubbed at his eyes. “Bad news is never a\nsurprise. Just a disappointment.”\n“I count thirteen.”\n“You can count ’em? I can’t even see ’em. They coming for us?”\nShe raised her arms. “You see anything else out here? Might be that\nlaughing bastard Finnius found some more friends.”\n“Shit.” He looked down at the cart, drawn up at the base of the hill. “We\ncan’t outrun them.”\n“No.” She curled her lip. “You could ask the spirits for their opinion.”\n“So they could tell us what? That we’re fucked?” Silence for a moment.\n“Better to wait, and fight them here. Bring the cart up to the top. At least\nwe’ve got a hill, and a few rocks to hide behind.”\n“That’s what I was thinking. Gives us some time to prepare the ground.”\n“Alright. We’d best get to it.”\nT\nhe point of the shovel bit into the ground with the sharp scrape of metal\non earth. An all-too-familiar sound. Digging pits and digging graves. What\nwas the difference?\nFerro had dug graves for all kinds of people. Companions, or as close as\nshe had come to companions. Friends, or as close as she had come to\nfriends. A lover or two, if you could call them that. Bandits, killers, slaves.\nWhoever hated the Gurkish. Whoever hid in the Badlands, for whatever\nreason.\nSpade up and spade down.\nWhen the fighting is over, you dig, if you are still alive. You gather up\nthe bodies in a line. You dig the graves in a row. You dig for your fallen\ncomrades. Your slashed, your punctured, your hacked, and your broken\ncomrades. You dig as deep as you can be bothered, you dump them in, you\ncover them up, they rot away and are forgotten, and you go on, alone.\nThat’s the way it’s always been.\nBut here, on this strange hill in the middle of this strange country, there\nwas still time. Still a chance for the comrades to live. That was the\ndifference, and for all her scorn, and her scowls, and her anger, she clung to\nit as she clung to the spade, desperate tight.\nStrange how she never stopped hoping.\n“You dig well,” said Ninefingers. She squinted up at him, standing over\nher at the edge of the pit.\n“Lots of practice.” She dug the spade into the earth beside the hole,\nplanted her hands on the sides, and jumped out, sat on the edge with her\nlegs hanging down. Her shirt was stuck to her with sweat, her face was\nrunning with it. She wiped her forehead with her dirty hand.

If I die, you bury me.” She held her hand out to him.\n“Deal?”\nHe raised an eyebrow at it. “Done.” It was a long time, she realised,\nsince she touched another person without the purpose of hurting them. It\nwas a strange feeling, his hand gripped in hers, his fingers tight round hers,\nhis palm pressed against hers. Warm. He nodded at her.

Men slipped and stumbled in the\nhalf-frozen muck, cursing and barging into their neighbours, boots tripping\non the boots of the man in front. The battalions had twisted, stretched,\nturned from neat blocks into shapeless blobs, merged with the units in front\nand behind, until the column moved in great ripples, one group hurrying\nforward while the next was still, like the segments of some monstrous,\nfilthy earthworm.\nAs soon as they reached the bridge, they had lost all semblance of order.\nThe ragged companies squeezed into that narrow space, shoving and\ngrunting, tired and bad-tempered. Those waiting behind pressed in tighter\nand tighter, impatient to be across so they could rest, slowing everything\ndown still further with the weight of their bodies. Then a cart, which had no\nbusiness being there in any case, had lost a wheel halfway across, and the\nsluggish flow of men over the bridge had become a trickle. No one seemed\nto know how to move it, or who to get to fix it, and contented themselves\nwith clambering over it, or slithering around it, and holding up the\nthousands behind.\nQuite a press had built up in the mud on this side of the fast-flowing\nwater. Men barged and grumbled shoulder to shoulder, spears sticking up\ninto the air at all angles, surrounded by shouting officers and an ever-\nincreasing detritus of rubbish and discarded gear. Behind them the great\nsnake of shambling men continued its spastic forward movement, feeding\never more soldiers into the confusion before the bridge. There was not the\nslightest evidence that anyone had even thought about trying to make them\nstop, let alone succeeded.\nAll this in column, under no pressure from the enemy, and with a half-\ndecent road to march on. West dreaded to imagine trying to manoeuvre\nthem in a battle line, through trees or over broken ground. He jammed his\ntired eyes shut, rubbed at them with his fingers, but when he opened them,\nthe horrifying, hilarious spectacle was still there before him. He hardly\nknew whether to laugh or cry.\nHe heard the sound of hooves on the rise behind him. Lieutenant\nJalenhorm, big and solid in his saddle. Short on imagination, perhaps, but a\nfine rider, and a trustworthy man. A good choice for the task that West had\nin mind.\n“Lieutenant Jalenhorm reporting, sir.” The big man turned in his saddle\nand looked down towards the river. “Looks like they’re having some\ntrouble on the bridge.”\n“Doesn’t it just. Only the start of our troubles, I fear.”\nJalenhorm grinned down. “I understand we have the advantage of\nnumbers, and of surprise—”\n“As far as numbers go, maybe. Surprise?” West gestured down at the\nmen milling around on the bridge, heard the vague, desperate shouts of their\nofficers. “This rabble? A blind man would hear us coming from ten miles’\ndistance. A blind and a deaf one would probably smell us before we were\nhalfway to battle order. We’ll be all day just getting across the river. And"

The Prince\nlives in a dream, and his staff exist only to keep him there, at any price.”\n“But surely—”\n“The price could be our lives.”\nJalenhorm frowned. “Come on, West, I hardly want to be going into\nbattle with that thought first on my mind—”\n“You won’t be going.”\n“I won’t?”\n“You will pick out six good men from your company, with spare\nmounts. You will ride as hard as possible for Ostenhorm, then north to Lord\nMarshal Burr’s camp.” West reached into his coat and pulled out his letter.\n“You will give him this. You will inform him that Bethod is already behind\nhim with the greater part of his strength, and that Prince Ladisla has most\nill-advisedly decided to cross the River Cumnur and give the Northmen\nbattle, directly against the Marshal’s orders.” West clenched his teeth.\n“Bethod will see us coming from miles away. We are handing the choice of\nthe ground to our enemy, so that Prince Ladisla can appear bold. Boldness\nis the best policy in war, apparently.”\n“West, surely it’s not that bad?”\n“When you reach Marshal Burr, tell him that Prince Ladisla has almost\ncertainly been defeated, quite possibly destroyed, and the road to\nOstenhorm left open. He’ll know what to do.”\nJalenhorm stared down at the letter, reached out to take it, then paused.\n“Colonel, I really wish that you’d send someone else. I should fight—”\n“Your fighting cannot possibly make any real difference, Lieutenant, but\nyour carrying this message might. There is no sentiment in this, believe me.\nI have no more important task than this one, and you are the man I trust to\nget it done. Do you understand your orders?”\nThe big man swallowed, then he took the letter, undid a button, and slid\nit carefully down inside his coat. “Of course, sir. I am honoured to carry it.”\nHe began to turn his horse.\n“There is one more thing.” West took a deep breath. “If I should… get\nmyself killed.

If I don’t\ncome back, just tell Ardee…” He thought about it for a moment. “Just tell\nher I’m sorry. That’s all.”\n“Of course. But I hope you’ll tell her yourself.”\n“So do I. Good luck.” West held out his hand.\nJalenhorm reached down and squeezed it in his own. “And to you.” He\nspurred his mount down the rise, away from the river.

Through the windows as he passed\npainfully by he could see the buildings of the city casting long shadows up\ntowards the rock. He could almost tell, at each window that he came to, that\nthe shadows were longer and less distinct, the sun was dimmer and colder.\nSoon it would be gone. Soon it will be night.\nHe paused for a moment before the doors to the audience chamber,\ncatching his breath, letting the ache in his leg subside, licking at his empty\ngums. “Give me the bag, then.”\nFrost handed him the sack, put one white hand against the doors. “You\nreathy?” he mumbled.\nReady as I’ll ever be. “Let’s get on with it.”\nGeneral Vissbruck was sitting stiff in his well-starched uniform, jowls\nbulging slightly over his high collar, hands plucking nervously at each\nother. Korsten dan Vurms was doing his best to look nonchalant, but his\ndarting tongue betrayed his anxiety. Magister Eider was sitting upright,\nhands clasped on the table before her, face stern. All business. A necklace of\nlarge rubies glowed with the last embers of the setting sun. Didn’t take her\ntoo long to find some more jewels, I see.\nThere was one more member of the gathering, and he showed not the\nslightest sign of nerves. Nicomo Cosca was lounging against the far wall,\nnot far behind his employer, arms crossed over his black breastplate. Glokta\nnoted that he had a sword at his hip, and a long dagger at the other.\n“What’s he doing here?”\n“This concerns everyone in the city,” said Eider calmly. “It is too\nimportant a decision for you to make alone.”\n“So he’s going to ensure that you get a fair say, eh?” Cosca shrugged\nand examined his dirty fingernails. “And what of the writ, signed by all\ntwelve chairs on the Closed Council?”\n“Your paper will not save us from the Emperor’s vengeance if the\nGurkish take the city.”\n“I see. So you have it in mind to defy me, to defy the Arch Lector, to\ndefy the King?”\n“I have it in mind to hear out the Gurkish emissary, and to consider the\nfacts.”\n“Very well,” said Glokta. He stepped forward and upended the bag.\n“Give him your ear.” Islik’s head dropped onto the table with a hollow\nclonking sound. It had no expression to speak of, beyond an awful\nslackness, eyes open and staring off in different directions, tongue lolling\nslightly. It rolled awkwardly along the beautiful tabletop, leaving an uneven\ncurve of bloody smears on the brightly polished wood, and came to rest,\nfaceup, just in front of General Vissbruck.\nA touch theatrical, perhaps, but dramatic. You’d have to give me that.\nNo one can be left in any doubt as to my level of commitment. Vissbruck\ngawped down at the bloody head on the table before him, his mouth slowly"

He started up from his seat and stumbled\nback, his chair clattering over on the tiles. He raised a shaking finger to\npoint at Glokta.\n“You’re mad! You’re mad! There’ll be no mercy for anyone! Every man,\nwoman, and child in Dagoska! If the city falls now, there’s no hope for any\nof us!”\nGlokta smiled his toothless smile. “Then I suggest that every one of you\ncommits themselves wholeheartedly to ensuring that the city does not fall.”\nHe looked over at Korsten dan Vurms. “Unless it’s already too late for that,\neh? Unless you’ve already sold the city to the Gurkish, and you can’t go\nback!”\nVurms’ eyes flickered to the door, to Cosca, to the horrified General\nVissbruck, to Frost, hulking ominous in the corner, and finally to Magister\nEider, still sitting steely calm and composed. And our little conspiracy is\njerked from the shadows.\n“He knows!” screamed Vurms, shoving back his chair and stumbling up,\ntaking a step towards the windows.\n“Clearly he knows.”\n“Then do something, damn it!”\n“I already have,” said Eider. “By now, Cosca’s men will have seized the\nland walls, bridged your channel, and opened the gates to the Gurkish. The\ndocks, the Great Temple, and even the Citadel itself, are also in their\nhands.” There was a faint rattling beyond the door. “I do believe that I can\nhear them now, just outside. I am sorry, Superior Glokta, indeed I am. You\nhave done everything His Eminence could have expected, and more, but the\nGurkish will already be pouring into the city. You see that further resistance\nis pointless.”\nGlokta looked up at Cosca. “May I retort?” The Styrian gave a small\nsmile, a stiff bow. “Most kind. I hate to disappoint you, but the gates are in\nthe hands of Haddish Kahdia, and several of his most committed priests. He\nsaid that he would open them to the Gurkish—what was his phrase—‘when\nGod himself commanded it.’ Do you have a divine visitation planned?” It\nwas plain from Eider’s face that she had not. “As for the Citadel, it has been\nseized by the Inquisition, for the safety of His Majesty’s loyal subjects, of\ncourse. Those are my Practicals that you can hear outside. As for Master\nCosca’s mercenaries—”\n“At their posts on the walls, Superior, as ordered!” The Styrian snapped\nhis heels together and gave an impeccable salute. “They stand ready to repel\nany assault by the Gurkish.” He grinned down at Eider. “I do apologise that\nI must leave your service at such a crucial time, Magister, but you\nunderstand that I had a better offer.”\nThere was a stunned pause. Vissbruck could hardly have looked more\nflabbergasted if he had been struck by lightning. Vurms stared around, wild-\neyed. He took one more step back, and Frost took a stride towards him."

He took one more step back, and Frost took a stride towards him.\nMagister Eider’s face had drained of colour. And so the chase ends, and the\nfoxes are at bay.\n“You should hardly be surprised.” Glokta settled back comfortably in his\nchair. “Nicomo Cosca’s disloyalty is a legend throughout the Circle of the\nWorld. There’s hardly a land under the sun in which he hasn’t betrayed an\nemployer.” The Styrian smiled and bowed once more.\n“It is your wealth,” muttered Eider, “not his disloyalty, that surprises me.\nWhere did you get it?”\nGlokta grinned. “The world is full of surprises.”\n“You fucking stupid bitch!” screamed Vurms. His steel was only\nhalfway out before Frost’s white fist crunched into his jaw and flung him\nsenseless against the wall. Almost at the same moment the doors crashed\nopen and Vitari burst into the room, half a dozen Practicals behind her,\nweapons at the ready.\n“Everything alright?” she asked.\n“Actually, we’re just finishing up. Take out the rubbish, would you,\nFrost?”\nThe albino’s fingers closed around Vurms’ ankle and hauled him bodily\nacross the floor and out of the audience chamber. Eider watched his slack\nface slide across the tiles, then looked up at Glokta. “What now?”\n“Now the cells.”\n“Then?”\n“Then we’ll see.” He snapped his fingers at the Practicals, jerked his\nthumb towards the door. Two of them tramped round the table, seized the\nQueen of merchants by her elbows, and bundled her impassively out of the\nroom.\n“So,” asked Glokta, looking over at Vissbruck. “Does anyone else wish\nto accept the ambassador’s offer of surrender?”\nThe General, who had been standing silently the whole time, snapped\nhis mouth shut, took a deep breath, and stood to stiff attention. “I am a\nsimple soldier. Of course I will obey any order from His Majesty, or His\nMajesty’s chosen representative. If the order is to hold Dagoska to the last\nman, I will give the last drop of my blood to do it. I assure you that I knew\nnothing of any plot. I acted rashly, perhaps, but at all times honestly, in what\nI felt were the best interests of—”\nGlokta waved his hand. “I am convinced. Bored, but convinced.” I have\nalready lost half the ruling council today. To lose any more might make me\nlook greedy. “The Gurkish will no doubt make their assault at first light.\nYou should look to our defences, General.”\nVissbruck closed his eyes, swallowed, wiped some sweat from his\nforehead. “You will not regret your faith in me, Superior.”\n“I trust that I will not. Go.”\nThe General hurried from the room, as though worried that Glokta might\nchange his mind, and the rest of the Practicals followed him. Vitari bent and\nlifted Vurms’ fallen chair and slid it carefully back under the table.\n“A neat job.” She nodded slowly to herself. “Very neat. I’m happy to say\nI was right about you all along.”"

I\njust said that it was neat,” and she turned and sauntered out into the\nhallway.\nThat only left him and Cosca. The mercenary leaned against the wall,\narms folded carelessly across his breastplate, regarding Glokta with a faint\nsmile. He had not moved the whole time.\n“You’d do well in Styria, I think. Very… ruthless? Is that the word?\nAnyway”—and he gave a flamboyant shrug—“I look forward very much to\nserving with you.” Until such time as someone offers you more, eh, Cosca?\nThe mercenary waved a hand at the severed head on the table. “Would you\nlike me to do something with that?”\n“Stick it on the battlements of the land walls, somewhere it can be easily\nseen. Let the Gurkish understand the strength of our resolve.”\nCosca clicked his tongue. “Heads on spikes, eh?” He dragged the head\noff the table by its long beard. “Never goes out of fashion.”\nThe doors clicked shut behind him, and Glokta was left alone in the\naudience chamber. He rubbed at his stiff neck, stretched his stiff leg out\nbeneath the bloody table. A good day’s work, all in all. But the day is over\nnow. Outside the tall windows, the sun had finally set over Dagoska.\nThe sky was dark.\nAmong the Stones\nT\nhe first traces of dawn were creeping over the plain. A glimmer of light\non the undersides of the towering clouds and along the edges of the ancient\nstones, a muddy flare on the eastern horizon. A sight a man rarely saw, that\nfirst grey glow, or one that Jezal had rarely seen anyway. At home he would\nhave been safely in his quarters now, sleeping soundly in a warm bed. None\nof them had slept last night. They had spent the long, cold hours in silence,\nsitting in the wind, peering into the dark for shapes out on the plain, and\nwaiting. Waiting for the dawn.\nNinefingers frowned at the rising sun. “Almost time. Soon they’ll be\ncoming.”\n“Right,” muttered Jezal numbly.\n“Listen to me, now. Stay here, and watch the cart. There’s plenty of ’em,\nand more than likely some will get round the back of us. That’s why you’re\nhere. You understand?”\nJezal swallowed. His throat was tight with the tension. All he could\nthink about was how unfair it was. How unfair, that he should die so young.\n“Alright. Me and her will be round the front of the hill there, in around\nthe stones. Most of ’em will come up that way, I reckon. You get in trouble,\nyou shout for us, but if we don’t come, well… do what you can. Might be\nwe’re busy. Might be we’re dead.”\n“I’m scared,” said Jezal.

We’re all scared.”\nFerro had a fierce smile on her face as she tightened the straps of her\nquiver around her chest, pulled the buckle on her sword-belt one notch\nfurther, dragged on her archery guard, and worked her fingers, twanged at\nher bowstring, everything neat, and quick, and ready for violence. While\nshe prepared for a fight that would most likely be the death of them all, she\nlooked as Jezal might have done dressing for a night round the taverns of\nAdua. Yellow eyes shining, excited in the half-light, as if she couldn’t wait\nto get started. He had never seen her look happy before. “She doesn’t look\nscared,” he said.\nNinefingers frowned over at her. “Well, maybe not her, but she’s not an\nexample I’d want to follow.” He watched her for a moment. “Sometimes,\nwhen someone lives in danger for too long, the only time they feel alive is\nwhen death’s breathing on their shoulder.”\n“Right,” muttered Jezal. The sight of the buckle on his own sword-belt,\nof the grips of his own steels, so proudly polished, made him feel sick now.\nHe swallowed again. Damn it, but his mouth had never been so full of spit.\n“Try to think about something else.”\n“Like what?”\n“Whatever gets you through it. You got family?”\n“A father, two brothers. I don’t know how much they like me.”\n“Shit on them, then. You got children?”\n“No.”\n“Wife?”\n“No.” Jezal grimaced. He had done nothing with his life but play cards\nand make enemies. No one would miss him.\n“A lover then? Don’t tell me there ain’t a girl waiting.”\n“Well, maybe…” But he did not doubt that Ardee would already have\nfound someone else. She had never seemed overly sentimental. Perhaps he\nshould have offered to marry her when he had the chance. At least then\nsomeone might have wept for him. “What about you?” he mumbled.\n“What? A family?” Ninefingers frowned, rubbing grimly at the stump of\nhis middle finger. “I did have one. And now I’ve got another. You don’t pick\nyour family, you take what you’re given and you make the best of it.” He\npointed at Ferro, then at Quai. “You see her, and him, and you?” He slapped\nhis hand down on Jezal’s shoulder. “That’s my family now, and I don’t plan\non losing a brother today, you understand?”\nJezal nodded slowly. You don’t pick your family. You make the best of\nit. Ugly, stupid, stinking, strange, it hardly seemed to matter now.\nNinefingers held out his hand, and Jezal gripped it in his own, as hard as he\ncould.\nThe Northman grinned. “Luck then, Jezal.”\n“And to you.”\nF\nerro knelt beside one of the pitted stones, her bow in one hand, an arrow"

The wind made patterns in the tall grass on the plain\nbelow, whipped at the shorter grass on the slope of the hill, plucked at the\nflights of the seven arrows stuck into the earth in front of her in a row.\nSeven arrows was all she had left.\nNothing like enough.\nShe watched them ride up to the base of the hill. She watched them\nclimb from their horses, staring upwards. She watched them tighten the\nbuckles on their scuffed leather armour, ready their weapons. Spears,\nswords, shields, a bow or two. She counted them. Thirteen. She had been\nright.\nBut that wasn’t much of a comfort.\nShe recognised Finnius, laughing and pointing up at the stones. Bastard.\nShe would shoot him first, if she got the chance, but there was no point\nrisking a shot at this range. They would be coming soon. Crossing the open\nground, struggling uphill.\nShe could shoot them then.\nThey began to spread out, peering up at the stones over the tops of their\nshields, their boots rustling in the long grass below. They had not seen her\nyet. There was one at the front without a shield, pounding up the slope with\na fierce grin on his face, a bright sword in each hand.\nShe drew the string back, unhurried, felt it dig reassuringly into her chin.\nThe arrow took him in the centre of his chest, right through his leather\nbreastplate. He sank to his knees, wincing and gasping. He pushed himself\nup with one of his swords, took a lurching step. Her second arrow stuck into\nhis body just above the first and he fell to his knees again, dribbled bloody\nspit onto the hillside, then rolled onto his back.\nBut there were plenty more, and still coming on. The nearest one was\nhunched down behind a big shield, pressing slowly up the slope with it held\nin front of him, trying not to expose a single inch of flesh. Her arrow\nthudded into the edge of the heavy wood.\n“Ssss,” she hissed, snatching another shaft from the earth. She drew\nback the string again, taking careful aim.\n“Argh!” he cried, as the arrow stuck him through his exposed ankle. The\nshield faltered and wobbled, drifted to the side.\nHer next shaft arced through the air and caught him cleanly through the\nneck, just above the shield rim. Blood bubbled down his skin, his eyes went\nwide and he toppled backwards, the shield sliding down the slope after him\nwith her wasted arrow sticking from it.\nBut that one had taken too long, and too many shafts. They were well up\nthe hillside now, halfway to the first stones, zigzagging left and right. She\nsnatched her last two arrows from the earth and slithered through the grass,\nup the slope. That was all she could do, for now. Ninefingers would have to\nlook after himself.\nL\nogen waited, his back pressed against the stone, trying to keep his\nbreathing quiet. He watched Ferro crawl further up the hill, away from him."

He watched Ferro crawl further up the hill, away from him.\n“Shit,” he muttered. Outnumbered and in trouble, yet again. He had\nknown this would happen from the first moment he took charge. It always\ndid. Well. He’d fought his way out of scrapes before, and he would fight his\nway out of this one now. Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say he’s a\nfighter.\nHe heard hurrying footsteps in the grass, and breathless grunting. A man\nlabouring up the hill, just to the left of the stone. Logen held his sword by\nhis right side, fingered the hard metal of the grip, clenched his jaws\ntogether. He saw the point of the man’s spear wobble past, then his shield.\nHe stepped out with a fighting roar, swinging the sword round in a great\nwide circle. It chopped deep into the man’s shoulder and opened a huge\ngash across his chest, spraying blood into the air, lifting him off his feet and\nsending him crashing down the hill, flopping over and over.\n“Still alive!” Logen panted as he sprinted away up the slope. A spear\nwhistled past and sank into the turf beside him as he slid in behind the next\nstone. A poor effort, but they’d have plenty more. He peered round the\nedge. He saw quick shapes, rushing from rock to rock. He licked his lips\nand hefted the Maker’s sword. There was blood on the dark blade now,\nblood on the silver letter near the hilt. But there was much more work to do.\nH\ne came up the hillside towards her, peering over the top of his shield,\nready to block an arrow if it came. No way to get at him from here, he was\nwatching too hard.\nShe ducked away behind the stone and slipped into the shallow trench\nshe had dug, started crawling. She came up to the far end, just behind\nanother great rock. She edged round behind it and peered out. She could see\nhim, his side to her, creeping up carefully towards the stone where she had\nbeen hiding. It seemed that God was feeling generous today.\nTowards her, if not towards him.\nThe shaft buried itself in his side, just above his waist. He stumbled,\nstared down at it. She pulled out her last arrow and nocked it. He was trying\nto pull the first one out when the second one stuck him in the middle of his\nchest. Right through the heart, she guessed, from the way he fell.\nThe arrows were gone. Ferro tossed her bow away and drew out the\nGurkish sword.\nIt was time to get close.\nL\nogen stepped round one of the stones and found himself looking straight\ninto a face, close enough almost to feel its breath on his cheek. A young\nface. A good-looking one, with clean skin and a sharp nose, wide-open\nbrown eyes. Logen smashed his forehead into it. The head snapped back\nand the young man stumbled, enough time for Logen to pull his knife from\nhis belt with his left hand. He let go of his sword, grabbed the edge of the\nman’s shield, and tore it out of the way. Brown Eyes’ head came up again,"

Once, twice,\nthree times. Hard, fast, underhand thrusts that half lifted him off his feet.\nBlood leaked out from the holes in his guts and over Logen’s hands. He\ngroaned, dropped his sword, started to slide down the stone, his legs giving\nway, and Logen watched him go. A choice between killing and dying is no\nchoice at all. You have to be realistic about these things.\nThe man sat in the grass, holding his bloody stomach. He looked up at\nLogen.\n“Guh,” he grunted. “Gurruh.”\n“What?”\nNothing else. His brown eyes were glassy.\nC\nome on!” screamed Ferro. “Come on, you fucking son of a whore!” She\nsquatted on the grass, ready to spring.\nHe did not speak her language, but he got the gist. His spear arced\nspinning through the air. Not a bad throw. She moved to the side and it\nclattered away into the stones.\nShe laughed at him and he came charging—a big, bald, bull of a man.\nFifteen strides away and she could see the grain on the handle of his axe.\nTwelve more strides, and she could see the creases on his snarling face, the\nlines at the corners of his eyes, across the bridge of his nose. Eight more\nstrides, and she could see the scratches on his leather breastplate. Five more\nstrides, and he raised his axe high. “Thaargh!” he squealed as the grass in\nfront of her suddenly collapsed beneath his feet and he pitched flailing into\none of the pits, the weapon flying from his hand.\nShould have watched where he stepped.\nShe sprang forward hungrily, swinging the sword without looking. He\nyelled as the heavy blade bit deep into his shoulder, squealed and gibbered,\ntrying to get away, scrambling at the loose earth. The sword chopped a hole\nin the top of his head and he gurgled, thrashed, slid down into the bottom of\nthe pit. The grave. His grave.\nHe did not deserve one, but never mind. She could drag him out later,\nand let him rot on the hillside.\nH\ne was a big bastard, this one. A great, fat giant of a man, half a head taller\nthan Logen. He had a huge club, big as half a tree, but he threw it around\neasily enough, shouting and roaring like a madman, little eyes rolling with\nfury in his pudgy face. Logen dodged and tottered between the stones. Not\neasy, trying to keep one eye on the ground behind him and one on that huge\nflailing tree limb. Not easy. Something was bound to go wrong.\nLogen stumbled on something. The boot of the brown-eyed man he’d\nkilled a minute before. There’s justice for you.

He saw the club swinging at him and he leaped back. Not far\nenough. The very tip of the great lump of wood clipped Logen’s thigh and\nnearly dragged him off his feet. He staggered against one of the stones,\nsquawking and dribbling and grimacing from the pain, fumbled his sword\nand nearly stabbed himself with it, snatched it up just in time to tumble and\nfall on his back as the club smashed away a great chunk of rock beside him.\nThe giant lifted his club high over his head, bellowing like a bull. A\nfearsome move, perhaps, but not a clever one. Logen sat up and stabbed\nhim through his gut, the dark blade sliding right up to the hilt almost, clean\nthrough his back. The club dropped from his hands and thudded on the turf\nbehind him, but with some last desperate effort he leaned down, grabbed\nhold of a fistful of Logen’s shirt, and hauled him close, roaring and baring\nhis bloody teeth. He started to raise his great ham of a fist.\nLogen pulled the knife out of his boot and rammed the blade into the\nside of the giant’s neck. He looked surprised, for just a moment, then blood\ndribbled from his mouth and down his chin. He let go of Logen’s shirt,\nstumbled back, spun slowly round, bounced off one of the stones, and\ncrashed on his face. Seems that Logen’s father had been right.

She felt the arrow\npierce her through the back of her shoulder, and when she looked down, she\ncould see the point sticking out the front of her shirt. It made her arm numb.\nDark blood leaked out into the dirty cloth. She hissed to herself as she\nducked behind one of the stones.\nShe still had the sword, though, and one good arm to use it. She slithered\nround the rock, the rough surface scraping at her back, listening. She could\nheard the archer’s footfalls in the grass, searching for her, the soft ringing as\nhe drew a blade. She saw him now, his back to her, looking right and left.\nShe jumped at him with the sword, but he turned in time and caught the\nblade on his own.

The arrow sticking from her shoulder had stabbed him through\nthe eye as they struggled on the floor.\nLucky for her.\nShe sprang forward, and the Gurkish sword chopped his foot out from\nunder him.

I don’t need to carve another body to\nfind that out.” Logen stretched his neck out, hefted the Maker’s sword in his\nhand. “But if you’re set on showing me your contents, I’ll not disappoint\nyou.”\n“Alright, then!” Finnius started forward. “If you’re that keen to see\nhell!”\nHe came on fast and hard, the shield up in front of him, herding Logen\nthrough the stones, jabbing and chopping quick with the sword. Logen\nstumbled back, short of breath, looking for an opening but not finding one.\nThe shield barged into his chest and knocked his breath out, pressed him\nback. He tried to dodge away but he lurched on his weak leg, and the short\nsword darted out and caught him across the arm. “Gah!” squawked Logen,\nstaggering against a stone, drops of blood pattering from the cut into the\ngrass.\n“One to me!” chuckled Finnius, dancing sideways and waving his sword\naround.\nLogen stood and watched him, breathing hard. The shield was a big one\nand this smiling bastard used it well. Gave him quite the advantage. He was\nquick, no doubt. Quicker than Logen, now, with a bad leg, a cut arm, and a\nthick head from a punch in the mouth. Where was the Bloody-Nine when\nyou wanted him? Logen spat on the ground. This fight he’d have to win\nalone.\nHe edged back, stooping more and panting harder than he needed to,\nletting his arm dangle as if it was useless, blood dripping from his limp\nfingers, blinking and wincing. He edged back past the stones into a space\nwith more room. A nice wide space, where he could get a decent swing.\nFinnius followed him, shield held up in front. “That it?” he grinned as he\ncame on. “Already fading, eh? I can’t say I’m not disappointed, I was\nhoping for a—”\nLogen roared, springing suddenly forward and lifting the Maker’s sword\nabove his head in both hands.

        "text": "hoping for a—”\nLogen roared, springing suddenly forward and lifting the Maker’s sword\nabove his head in both hands. Finnius scrambled back, but not quite far\nenough. The grey blade tore a chunk from the corner of his shield, sliced\nclean through, and chopped deep into the side of one of the stones with a\nmighty clang, sending chips of rock spinning. The impact nearly tore the\nsword from Logen’s hands, sent him flailing sideways.\nFinnius groaned. Blood was running from a cut on his shoulder, a cut\nright through his leather armour and into the flesh. The tip of the sword\nmust have gashed him as it passed. Not deep enough to kill, unfortunately,\nbut deep enough to make the point alright.\nIt was Logen’s turn to grin. “That it?”\nThey moved at the same moment. The two blades clanged together, but\nLogen’s grip was the stronger. Finnius’ sword twittered as it spun from his\nhand and away down the hillside. He gasped, snatching at his belt for a\ndagger, but before he could get there Logen was on him, growling and\ngrunting as he chopped mindlessly away at the shield, hacking great scars in\nthe wood and sending splinters flying, driving Finnius stumbling away. One\nlast blow crashed into the shield and he staggered from the force of it,\ntripped over the corner of a fallen stone poking through the grass, and\ntumbled onto his back. Logen gritted his teeth and swung the Maker’s\nsword down.\nIt sliced clean through the greave on Finnius’ shin and took his foot off\njust above the ankle, splattering blood into the grass. He dragged himself\nbackwards, started to scramble up, shrieked as he tried to put his weight on\nhis missing foot, dropped onto the stump, and sprawled on his back again,\ncoughing and groaning.\n“My foot!” he wailed.\n“Put it out of your mind,” growled Logen, kicking the dead thing out of\nhis way and stepping forward.\n“Wait!” gurgled Finnius, shoving himself back through the grass with\nhis good leg towards one of the standing stones, leaving a bloody trail\nbehind him.\n“For what?”\n“Just wait!” He dragged himself up the rock, hopped on his remaining\nfoot, cringing away. “Wait!” he screamed.\nLogen’s sword caught the inside rim of the shield, tore the straps away\nfrom Finnius’ limp arm, and flung it bouncing down the slope on its\nchewed-up edge. Finnius gave a desperate wail and pulled out his knife,\npoised himself on his one good leg to lunge. Logen chopped a great gash in\nhis chest. Blood sprayed out and showered down his breastplate. His eyes\nbulged, he opened his mouth wide, but all that came out was a gentle\nwheeze. The dagger dropped from his fingers and fell silently into the grass.\nHe slid sideways and dropped onto his face.\nBack to the mud with that.\nLogen stood, and blinked, and breathed. The cut on his arm was starting\nto sting like fire, his leg was aching, his breath was coming in ragged gasps.\n“Still alive,” he muttered to himself. “Still alive.” He closed his eyes for a\nmoment."

The others. He started to hobble back up the slope\ntowards the summit.\nT\nhe arrow in her shoulder had made her slow. Her shirt was wet with blood\nand she was getting thirsty, and stiff, and sluggish. He slid out from behind\none of the stones, and before she knew it he was on her.\nThere was no room to use the sword any longer, so she let it drop. She\nmade a grab for her knife, but he caught her by the wrist, and he was strong.\nHe threw her back against the stone and her head cracked against it, made\nher dizzy for a moment. She could see a muscle trembling under his eye,\nthe black pores on his nose, the fibres standing out on his neck.\nShe twisted and struggled, but his weight bore down on her. She snarled\nand spat, but even Ferro’s strength was not endless. Her arms trembled, her\nelbows bent. His hand found her throat, and tightened round it. He muttered\nsomething through clenched teeth, squeezing and squeezing. She could not\nbreathe any longer, and the strength was ebbing out of her.\nThen, through her half-closed eyes, she saw a hand slither round his face\nfrom behind. A big, pale, three-fingered hand, caked with dry blood. A big,\npale forearm followed it, and another, from the other side, folding his head\ntightly. He wriggled, and struggled, but there was no escape. The thick\nsinews flexed and squirmed under the skin and the pale fingers dug into his\nface, dragging his head back and to the side, further and further. He let go\nof Ferro, and she sagged against the stone, sucking in air. He scrabbled\nuselessly at the arms with his fingernails. He made a long, strange hissing\nsound as his head was twisted relentlessly round.\n“Ssssss…” Crunch.\nThe arms let go and he crumpled on the floor, head hanging. Ninefingers\nstood behind. There was dry blood across his face, blood on his hands,\nblood soaked through his torn clothes. His face was pale and twitchy,\nstreaked with dirt and sweat.\n“You alright?”\n“About like you,” she croaked. “Any left?”\nHe put one hand on the stone beside her and leaned over, spat blood out\nonto the grass. “Don’t know. Couple, maybe.”\nShe squinted up at the summit of the hill. “Up there?”\n“Could be.”\nShe bent and snatched the curved sword up from the grass, started to\nlimp up the slope, using it like a crutch. She heard Ninefingers struggling\nafter her.\nF\nor some minutes now, Jezal had heard occasional shouting, screaming,\nand clashing of metal on metal. Everything was vague and distant, filtering\nto his ears through the blustering wind across the hilltop.

He strode up and down, his hands opening\nand closing, and all the while Quai sat on the cart, looking down at Bayaz,\nsilent and infuriatingly calm.\nIt was then that he saw it. A man’s head, rising up over the brow of the\nhill between two tall stones. Next came his shoulders, then his chest.\nAnother appeared not far away. A second man. Two killers, advancing up\nthe slope towards him.\nOne of them had piggy eyes and a heavy jaw. The other was thinner,\nwith a tangled thatch of fair hair. They moved cautiously up onto the\nsummit of the hill until they stood within the circle of stones, examining\nJezal, and Quai, and the cart, with no particular urgency.\nJezal had never fought two men at once before. He had never fought to\nthe death before either, but he tried not to think about that. This was simply\na fencing match. Nothing new. He swallowed, and drew his steels. The\nmetal rang reassuringly as it slid out, the familiar weight in his palms was a\nsmall comfort. The two men stared at him and Jezal stared back, trying to\nremember what Ninefingers had told him.\nTry to look weak. That, at least, did not present much difficulty. He did\nnot doubt that he appeared suitably scared. It was the most he could do not\nto turn and run. He backed slowly away towards the cart, licking his lips\nwith a nervousness that was anything but feigned.\nNever take an enemy lightly. He looked them over, these two. Strong-\nlooking men, well equipped. They both wore armour of rigid leather,\ncarried square shields. One had a short sword, the other an axe with a heavy\nblade. Deadly-looking weapons, well worn. Taking them lightly was hardly\nhis problem. They spread out, moving round to either side of him, and he\nwatched them go.\nThe time comes to act, you strike with no backwards glances. The one\non Jezal’s left came at him. He saw the man snarl, saw him rear up, saw the\ngreat unwieldy backswing. It was an absurdly simple matter for him to step\nout of the way and let it thud into the turf beside him. On an instinct he\nthrust with his short steel and buried it in the man’s side up to the hilt,\nbetween his breastplate and his backplate, just under his bottom rib. Even as\nJezal was ripping the blade back he was ducking under the other’s axe and\nwhipping his long steel across at neck height. He danced past them and\nspun around, steels held ready, waiting for the referee’s call.\nThe one he had stabbed staggered a step or two, wheezing and grabbing\nat his side. The other stood there, swaying, his piggy eyes bulging, his hand\nclutched to his neck. Blood began to pour out between his fingers from his\nslit throat. They fell almost at the same time, facedown, right next to each\nother.\nJezal frowned at the blood on his long steel. He frowned at the two\ncorpses he had made. Almost without thinking he had killed two men. He"

He\nshould have felt guilty, but he felt numb. No. He felt proud. He felt\nexhilarated! He looked up at Quai, watching him calmly from the back of\nthe cart.\n“I did it,” he muttered, and the apprentice nodded slowly. “I did it!” he\nshouted, waving his bloody short steel in the air.\nQuai frowned, and then his eyes went wide. “Behind you!” he shouted,\nhalf jumping up out of his seat. Jezal turned, bringing up his steels, saw\nsomething moving out of the very corner of his eye.\nThere was a mighty crunching and his head exploded with brilliant light.\nThen all was darkness.\nThe Fruits of Boldness\nT\nhe Northmen stood on the hill, a thin row of dark figures with the white\nsky behind them. It was still early, and the sun was nothing more than a\nbright smear among thick clouds. Patches of half-melted snow were\nscattered cold and dirty in the hollows of the valley sides, a thin layer of\nmist was still clinging to the valley floor.\nWest watched that row of black shapes, and frowned. He did not like the\nflavour of this. Too many for a scouting or a foraging party, far too few to\nmount any challenge, and yet they stayed there on the high ground,\nwatching calmly as Ladisla’s army continued its interminable, clumsy\ndeployment in the valley beneath them.\nThe Prince’s staff, and a small detachment of his guards, had made their\nheadquarters on a grassy knoll opposite the Northmen’s hill. It had seemed\na fine, dry spot when the scouts found it early that morning, well below the\nenemy perhaps, but still high enough to get a good view of the valley. Since\nthen the passage of thousands of sliding boots, squashing hooves, and\nchurning cartwheels had ground the wet earth to sticky black muck. West’s\nown boots and those of the other men around were caked with it, their\nuniforms spattered with it. Even Prince Ladisla’s pristine whites had\nacquired a few smears.\nA couple of hundred strides ahead, on lower ground, was the centre of\nthe Union battle line. Four battalions of the King’s Own infantry formed the\nbackbone, each one a neat block of bright-red cloth and dull steel, looking\nat this distance as though they had been positioned with a giant ruler. In\nfront of them were a few thin ranks of flatbowmen in their leather jerkins\nand steel caps; behind were the cavalry, dismounted for the time being, the\nriders looking strangely ungainly in full armour. Spread out to either side\nwere the haphazard shapes of the levy battalions, with their assortment of\nmismatched equipment, their officers bellowing and waving their arms,\ntrying to get the gaps to close up, the skewed ranks to straighten, like\nsheepdogs barking at a flock of wayward sheep.\nTen thousand men, perhaps, all told. Every one of them, West knew, was\nlooking up at that thin screen of Northmen, no doubt with the same nervous\nmixture of fear and excitement, curiosity and anger, that he was feeling at"

        "text": "looking up at that thin screen of Northmen, no doubt with the same nervous\nmixture of fear and excitement, curiosity and anger, that he was feeling at\nhis first sight of the enemy.\nThey hardly seemed too fearsome through his eye-glass. Shaggy-headed\nmen, dressed in ragged hides and furs, gripping primitive-looking weapons.\nJust what the least imaginative members of the Prince’s staff might have\nbeen expecting. They scarcely looked like any part of the army that\nThreetrees had described, and West did not like that. There was no way of\nknowing what was on the far side of that hill, no reason for those men to be\nthere but to distract them, or draw them on. Not everyone shared his doubts,\nhowever.\n“They mock us!” snapped Smund, squinting up through his own eye-\nglass. “We should give them a taste of Union lances! A swift charge and our\nhorsemen will sweep that rabble aside and carry that hill!” He spoke almost\nas if the carrying of that hill, irrelevant except for the fact that the Northmen\nwere standing on it, would bring the campaign to a swift and glorious\nconclusion.\nWest could do nothing but grit his teeth and shake his head, as he had\ndone a hundred times already today. “They have the high ground,” he\nexplained, taking care to speak slowly and patiently. “Poor terrain for a\ncharge, and they may have support. Bethod’s main body, for all we know,\njust over the rise.”\n“They look like nothing more than scouts,” muttered Ladisla.\n“Looks can lie, Your Highness, and that hill is worthless. Time is with\nus. Marshal Burr will be marching to our aid, while Bethod can expect no\nhelp. We have no reason to seek a battle now.”\nSmund snorted. “No reason except that this is a war, and the enemy\nstand before us on Union soil! You are always carping on the poor state of\nthe men’s morale, Colonel!” He jabbed his finger up at the hill. “What could\nbe more damaging to their spirits than to sit idle in the face of the enemy?”\n“A sharp and purposeless defeat?” growled West.\nIt was an unfortunate chance that one of the Northmen chose that\nmoment to loose an arrow down into the valley. A tiny black sliver sailed up\ninto the sky. It came only from a shortbow. Even with the advantage of\nheight the shaft plopped down harmlessly into open ground a hundred\nstrides or more from the front lines. A singularly pointless gesture, but its\neffect on Prince Ladisla was immediate.\nHe abandoned his folding field chair and leaped to his feet. “Damn\nthem!” he cursed. “They are mocking us! Issue orders!” He strode up and\ndown, shaking his fist. “Have the cavalry form up for a charge\nimmediately!”\n“Your Highness, I urge you to reconsider—”\n“Damn it, West!” The heir to the throne hurled his hat down on the\nmuddy ground. “You oppose me at every turn! Would your friend Colonel\nGlokta have hesitated with the enemy before him?”\nWest swallowed. “Colonel Glokta was captured by the Gurkish, and\ncaused the deaths of every man under his command.” He bent slowly and\npicked up the hat, offered it respectfully up to the Prince, wondering all the"

Mine is the burden of\ncommand, and mine alone!” He turned back towards the valley. “Sound the\ncharge!”\nWest felt suddenly, terribly tired. It seemed he scarcely had the strength\nto stand as the confident bugle call rang out in the crisp air, as the horsemen\nstruggled into their saddles, eased forward between the blocks of infantry,\ntrotted down the gentle slope, lances up. They broke into a gallop as they\ncrossed the valley floor, half obscured in a sea of mist, the thunder of their\nhoofbeats echoing round the valley. A few scattered arrows fell among\nthem, glancing harmlessly from their heavy armour as they streamed\nforward. They began to lose momentum as they hit the upward slope, their\nlines breaking as they pushed on over the gorse and the broken ground, but\nthe sight of all that weight of steel and horseflesh had its effect on the\nNorthmen above. Their ragged line began to waver, then to break. They\nturned tail and fled, some of them tossing away their weapons as they\ndisappeared over the brow of the hill.\n“That’s the damn recipe!” yelled Lord Smund. “Drive ’em, damn it!\nDrive ’em!”\n“Ride them down!” laughed Prince Ladisla, tearing off his hat again and\nwaving it in the air. A scattering of cheers floated up from the levies in the\nvalley, over the distant hammering of hooves.\n“Drive them,” muttered West, clenching his fists. “Please.”\nThe riders crested the ridge and gradually disappeared from view.\nSilence fell over the valley. A long, strange, unexpected silence. A few\ncrows circled overhead, croaking their harsh calls to one another. West\nwould have given anything for their view of the battlefield. The tension was\nalmost unbearable. He strode back and forth while the long minutes\nstretched out, and still no sign.\n“Taking their time, eh?”\nPike was standing right next to him, his daughter just behind. West\nwinced and looked away. He still found it somehow painful to look at that\nburned face for long, especially coming on him sudden and unannounced.\n“What are you two doing here?”\nThe convict shrugged his shoulders. “There’s plenty for a smith to do\nbefore a battle. Even more after it. Not much while the fighting’s\nhappening, though.” He grinned, slabs of burned flesh folding up like\nleather on one side of his face. “Thought I’d take a look at Union arms in\naction. Besides, what safer place could there be than the Prince’s\nheadquarters?”\n“Don’t mind us,” muttered Cathil, a thin smile on her face, “we’ll make\nsure to keep out of your way.”\nWest frowned. If that was a reference to his being constantly in their\nway, he was in no mood to enjoy it. There was still no sign of the cavalry.\n“Where the hell are they?” snapped Smund."

There was still no sign of the cavalry.\n“Where the hell are they?” snapped Smund.\nThe Prince took a break from chewing down his fingernails. “Give ’em\ntime, Lord Smund, give ’em time.”\n“Why doesn’t this mist dry up?” murmured West. There was enough\nsunlight breaking through the clouds now, but the mist only seemed to be\nthickening, creeping up the valley towards the archers. “Damn mist, it’ll\nwork against us.”\n“That’s them!” yelled one of the Prince’s staff, shrill with excitement,\nfinger stretched out rigid towards the crest of the hill.\nWest raised his eye-glass, breathless, scanned quickly across the green\nline. He saw the spear-points, stiff and regular, rising slowly over the brow.\nHe felt a surge of relief. Rarely had he been happier to be proved wrong.\n“It’s them!” yelled Smund, grinning broadly. “They’re back! What did I\ntell you? They’re…” Helmets appeared beneath the spear-points, and then\nmailed shoulders. West felt the relief seeping away, horror creeping up his\nthroat. An organised body of armoured men, their round shields painted\nwith faces, and animals, and trees, and a hundred other patterns, no two\nalike. More men appeared over the crest of the hill to either side of them.\nMore mailed figures.\nBethod’s Carls.\nThey halted just beyond the highest point of the hill. A scattering of men\ncame forward from the even ranks, knelt in the short grass.\nLadisla lowered his eye-glass. “Are those… ?”\n“Flatbows,” muttered West.\nThe first volley drifted up, gently almost, a shifting grey cloud of bolts,\nlike a flock of well-trained birds. They were silent for a moment, then the\nangry rattling of the bowstrings reached West’s ears. The bolts began to\ndrop towards the Union lines. They fell among the King’s Own, clattered\ndown onto their heavy shields, their heavy armour. There were some cries, a\nfew gaps appeared in their lines.\nThe mood in the headquarters had turned, in the space of a minute, from\nbrash confidence, to mute surprise, to stupefied dismay. “They have\nflatbows?” someone spluttered. West stared at the archers on the hill\nthrough his eye-glass, slowly cranking back their bowstrings, pulling bolts\nfrom their quivers, fitting them into position. The range had been well\njudged. Not only did they have flatbows, but they knew how to use them.\nWest hurried over to Prince Ladisla, who was gaping at a wounded man\nbeing carried, head lolling, from between the ranks of the King’s Own.\n“Your Highness, we must advance and close the distance so that our\narchers can return fire, or withdraw to higher ground!” Ladisla only stared\nat him, giving no sign that he had heard, let alone understood. A second\nvolley arced down into the infantry in front of them. This time it fell among\nthe levies, a unit without shields or armour.

Some wounded man began to make a thin,\nanimal screeching, and would not stop. “Your Highness, do we advance, or\nwithdraw?”\n“I… we…” Ladisla gaped over at Lord Smund, but for once the young\nnobleman was at a loss for words. He looked even more stupefied than the\nPrince, if that was possible. Ladisla’s lower lip trembled. “How… I…\nColonel West, what is your opinion?”\nThe temptation to remind the Crown Prince that his was the burden of\ncommand, and his alone, was almost overpowering, but West bit his tongue.\nWithout some sense of purpose, this ragtag army might swiftly dissolve.\nBetter to do the wrong thing than nothing at all. He turned to the nearest\nbugler. “Sound the retreat!” he roared.\nThe bugles called the withdrawal: blaring, discordant. Hard to believe\nthey were the same instruments that had so brazenly called the charge just a\nfew short minutes before. The battalions began to edge slowly backwards.\nAnother volley fell among the levies, and another. Their formations were\nbeginning to come apart, men hurrying backwards to escape the murderous\nfire, stumbling over each other, ranks dissolving into mobs, the air full of\nshrieks and confusion. West could scarcely tell where the next set of flatbow\nbolts fell, the mist had risen so high. The Union battalions had become\nnothing more than wobbling spears and the odd insubstantial helmet above\na grey cloud. Even here, high up among the baggage, the mist was curling\nround West’s ankles.\nUp on the hill the Carls began to move. They thrust their weapons in the\nair and clashed them against their painted shields. They gave a great shout,\nbut not the deep roar that West might have expected. Instead, a weird and\nchilling howl floated over the valley, a keening wail that cut through the\nrattling and scraping of metal and into the ears of those watching, down\nbelow. A mindless, a furious, a primitive sound. A sound made by monsters,\nnot by men.\nPrince Ladisla and his staff gawped at one another, and stuttered, and\nstared, as the Carls began to tramp down the hill, rank upon rank of them,\ntowards the thickening mist in the valley’s bottom, where the Union troops\nwere still blindly trying to pull back. West shouldered his way through the\nfrozen officers to the bugler.\n“Battle lines!”\nThe lad turned from staring at the advancing Northmen to staring at\nWest, his bugle hanging from his nerveless fingers.\n“Lines!” roared a voice from behind. “Form lines!” It was Pike,\nbellowing loud enough to match any drill sergeant. The bugler snapped his\ninstrument to his lips and blew lines for all he was worth. Answering calls\nechoed through the mist, risen up all around them, now. Muffled bugles,\nmuffled shouts.\n“Halt and form up!”\n“Form lines now, lads!”\n“Prepare!”\n“Steady!”"

Men moving in\narmour, spears being set, swords drawn, calls from man to man and from\nunit to unit. Above all, growing steadily louder, the unearthly howling of\nthe Northmen as they began their charge, surging down from the high\nground and into the valley. West felt a chill in his own blood, even with a\nhundred strides of earth and a few thousand armed men between him and\nthe enemy. He could well imagine the fear those in the front lines were\nfeeling now, as the shapes of the Carls began to rise out of the mist before\nthem, screaming their war cries with their weapons held high.\nThere was no sound that signified the moment of contact. The clattering\ngrew louder and louder, the shouts and the howls were joined by high-\npitched cries, low-pitched growls, shrieks of pain or rage mixed into the\nterrifying din with ever-greater frequency. Nobody in the headquarters\nspoke. Every man, West among them, was peering into the murk, straining\nwith every sense to get some hint of what might be happening just before\nthem in the valley.\n“There!” someone shouted. A faint figure was moving through the\ngloom ahead. All eyes were fixed on it as it took shape before them. A\nyoung, breathless, mud-splattered, and highly confused lieutenant. “Where\nthe hell is the headquarters?” he shouted as he stumbled up the slope\ntowards them.\n“This is it.”\nThe man gave West a flamboyant salute. “Your Highness—”\n“I am Ladisla,” snapped the real Prince. The man turned, bewildered,\nbegan to salute once more. “Speak your message, man!”\n“Of course, sir, Your Highness, Major Bodzin has sent me to tell you\nthat his battalion is heavily engaged, and…”—he was still gasping for\nbreath—“he needs reinforcement.”\nLadisla stared at the young man as though he had been speaking in a\nforeign language. He looked at West. “Who is Major Bodzin?”\n“Commander of the first battalion of the Stariksa levies, Your Highness,\non our left wing.”\n“Left wing, I see… er…”\nA semicircle of brightly dressed staff officers had congealed around the\nbreathless lieutenant. “Tell the Major to hold!” shouted one of them.\n“Yes!” said Ladisla. “Tell your Major to hold, and to, er, to drive back\nthe enemy. Yes indeed!” He was warming to his role now. “To drive them\nback, and to fight to the last man! Tell Major Clodzin that help is on the\nway. Most definitely… on the way!” And the Prince strode off manfully.\nThe young lieutenant turned, peered into the murk. “Which way is my\nunit?” he muttered.\nMore figures were already beginning to take form. Running figures,\nscrambling through the mud, panting for breath. Levies, West saw straight\naway, broken from the backs of crumbling units as soon as they had made\ncontact with the enemy. As though there had ever been any chance that they\nwould stand for long."

As though there had ever been any chance that they\nwould stand for long.\n“Cowardly dogs!” cursed Smund at their receding backs. “Get back\nhere!” He might as well have given orders to the mist. Everyone was\nrunning: deserters, adjutants, messengers looking for help, for direction, for\nreinforcement. The first wounded too. Some were limping under their own\npower, or using broken spears for crutches, some were half carried by\ncomrades. Pike started forward to help a pale fellow with a flatbow bolt\nsticking from his shoulder. Another casualty was dragged past on a\nstretcher, muttering to himself. His left arm was off just below the elbow,\noozing blood through a tightly bound stretch of dirty cloth.\nLadisla looked greasy pale. “I have a headache. I must sit down. What\nhas become of my field chair?”\nWest chewed at his lip. He had no inkling of what to do. Burr had sent\nhim with Ladisla for his experience, but he was every bit as clueless as the\nPrince. Every plan relied on being able actually to see the enemy, or at any\nrate one’s own positions. He stood there, frozen, as useless and frustrated as\na blind man in a fistfight.\n“What is happening, damn it!” The Prince’s voice cut across the din,\nshrill and petulant. “Where did this damn mist come from? I demand to\nknow what is happening! Colonel West! Where is the Colonel? What is\ngoing on out there?”\nIf only he had been able to provide an answer. Men stumbled and darted\nand charged through the muddy headquarters, apparently at random. Faces\nloomed up from the mist and were gone, faces full of fear, confusion,\ndetermination. Runners with garbled messages or garbled orders, soldiers\nwith bloody wounds or no weapons. Disembodied voices floated on the\ncold air, speaking over one another, anxious, hurried, panicked, agonised.\n“… Our regiment has made contact with the enemy, and are falling back,\nor were falling back, I think…”\n“My knee! Damn it, my knee!”\n“… His Highness the Prince? I have an urgent message from…”\n“Send, er… someone! Whoever is available… who is available?”\n“… King’s Own are heavily engaged! They request permission to\nwithdraw…”\n“What happened to the cavalry? Where are the cavalry?”\n“… devils, not men! The Captain’s dead and…”\n“We are falling back!”\n“… fighting hard on the right wing and in need of support! In desperate\nneed of support…”\n“Help me! Somebody, please!”\n“… And then counterattack! We are attacking all across the line…”\n“Quiet!” West could hear something in the grey gloom. The jingling of a\nharness. The mist was so dense now that he could see no more than thirty\nstrides, but the sound of trotting hooves drawing closer was unmistakable.\nHis hand closed round the hilt of his sword.\n“The cavalry, they’ve returned!” Lord Smund started eagerly forward.\n“Wait!” hissed West, to no effect. His eyes strained into the grey. He saw\nthe outlines of horsemen, coming steadily through the gloom. The shapes of"

The shapes of\ntheir armour, of their saddles, of their helmets were those of the King’s\nOwn, and yet there was something in the way they rode—slouching, loose.\nWest drew his sword. “Protect the Prince,” he muttered, taking a step\ntowards Ladisla.\n“You there!” shouted Lord Smund at the foremost horseman. “Prepare\nyour men for another—” The rider’s sword chopped into his skull with a\nhollow clicking sound. A spray of blood went up, black in the white mist,\nand the horsemen broke into a charge, screaming at the tops of their voices.\nTerrifying, eerie, inhuman sounds. Smund’s limp body was flung out of the\nway by the leading horse, trampled under the flailing hooves of the one\nbeside it. Northmen, now, unmistakably, growing more horrifyingly distinct\nas they loomed up out of the murk. The foremost of them had a thick beard,\nlong hair streaming out from beneath an ill-fitting Union helmet, yellow\nteeth bared, eyes of horse and rider both wide with fury. His heavy sword\nflashed down and hacked one of the Prince’s guards between the shoulder\nblades as he dropped his spear and turned to run.\n“Protect the Prince!” screamed West. Then it was chaos. Horses\nthundered past all around, riders yelled, hacked about them with swords and\naxes, men ran in all directions, slipped, fell, were cut down where they\nstood, were trampled where they lay. The heavy air was full of the wind of\npassing horsemen, flying mud, screams and panic and fear.\nWest dived out of the way of flailing hooves, sprawled on his face in the\nmuck, slashed uselessly at a passing horse, rolled and spun and gasped at\nthe mist. He had no idea which way he was facing, everything sounded the\nsame, looked the same. “Protect the Prince!” he shouted again, pointlessly,\nvoice hoarse, drowned out in the din, spinning round and round.\n“Over on the left!” someone shrieked. “Form a line!” There were no\nlines. There was no left. West stumbled over a body, a hand clutched at his\nleg, and he slashed at it with his sword.\n“Ah.” He was on his face. His head hurt terribly. Where was he?\nFencing practice, perhaps. Had Luthar knocked him down again? That boy\nwas getting too good for him. He stretched for the grip of his sword, lying\ntrampled in the mud. A hand slithered through grass, far away, fingers\nstretching. He could hear his own breathing, painfully loud, echoing in his\nthumping head. Everything was blurred, shifting, mist before his eyes, mist\nin his eyes. Too late. He could not reach his sword. His head was throbbing.\nThere was mud in his mouth. He rolled over onto his back, slowly,\nbreathing hard, up onto his elbows. He saw a man coming. A Northman, by\nhis shaggy outline. Of course. There was a battle. West watched him walk\nslowly forward. There was a dark line in his hand. A weapon. Sword, axe,"

Sword, axe,\nmace, spear, what was the difference? The man took one more unhurried\nstep, planted his boot on West’s jacket, and shoved his limp body down into\nthe mud.\nNeither of them said anything. No last words. No pithy phrases. No\nexpressions of anger or remorse, of victory or defeat. The Northman raised\nhis weapon.\nHis body jolted. He lurched forward a step. He blinked and swayed. He\nhalf turned, slowly, stupidly. His head jolted again.\n“Got something in…” he said, lips fumbling with the words. He felt at\nthe back of his head with his free hand. “Where’s my…” He swivelled\nround, falling sideways, one leg in the air, and crashed onto his side in the\nmuck. Somebody stood behind him. They came close, leaned over. A\nwoman’s face. She seemed familiar, somehow.\n“You alive?”\nLike that, West’s mind clicked back into place. He took a great coughing\nbreath, rolled over, and grabbed hold of his sword. There were Northmen,\nNorthmen behind their lines! He scrambled to his feet, clawed the blood out\nof his eyes. They had been tricked! His head was pounding, spinning.\nBethod’s cavalry, disguised, the Prince’s headquarters, overrun! He jerked\naround, wild-eyed, boot heels slipping in the mud, looking for enemies in\nthe mist, but there was no one. Only him and Cathil. The sound of hooves\nhad faded, the horsemen had passed, at least for now.\nHe looked down at his steel. The blade was snapped off a few inches\nfrom the hilt. Worthless. He let it fall, prised the Northman’s dead fingers\nfrom his sword and grabbed hold of the hilt, his head thumping all the time.\nA heavy weapon with a thick, notched blade, but it would serve.\nHe stared down at the corpse, lying on its side. The man who had been\nabout to kill him. The back of his skull was a caved-in mess of red splinters.\nCathil had a smith’s hammer in her hand. The head was sticky dark with\nblood and strands of matted hair.\n“You killed him.” She had saved his life. They both knew it, so there\nhardly seemed any point in saying it.\n“What do we do now?”\nHead for the front lines. That was what the dashing young officer always\ndid in the stories West had read as a boy. March for the sounds of battle.\nRally a new unit from stragglers and lead them into the fray, turn the tide of\nthe fighting at the critical moment. Home in time for dinner and medals.\nLooking down at the wreckage and the broken corpses the horsemen had\nleft behind, West almost laughed at the idea. It was suddenly too late for\nheroics, and he knew it. It had been too late for a long time.\nThe fates of the men down in the valley had been set long ago. When\nLadisla chose to cross the river.

When the great noblemen of the Union sent beggars instead of\nsoldiers to fight for their King. A hundred different chances, from days, and\nweeks, and months before, all coming together here, on this worthless\nstretch of mud. Chances which neither Burr, nor Ladisla, nor West himself\ncould have predicted or done anything to prevent.\nHe could make no difference now, no one could. The day was lost.\n“Protect the Prince,” he muttered.\n“What?”\nWest began to cast around on the ground, rooting through the scattered\njunk, rolling over bodies with his dirty hands. A messenger stared up at him,\nthe side of his face split open, bloody pulp hanging out. West retched,\ncovered his mouth, crawled on his hands and knees to the next corpse. One\nof the Prince’s staff, still with a look of faint surprise on his features. There\nwas a ragged sword cut through the heavy gold braid of his uniform,\nreaching all the way down to his belly.\n“What the hell are you doing?” Pike’s gruff voice. “There’s no time for\nthis!” The convict had got an axe from somewhere. A heavy Northern axe,\nwith blood on the edge. Not a good idea, most likely, for a criminal to have\na weapon like that, but West had other worries.\n“We must find Prince Ladisla!”\n“Shit on him!” hissed Cathil. “Let’s go!”\nWest shook off her hand, stumbled to a heap of broken boxes, wiping\nmore blood out of his eye. Somewhere here. Somewhere near here, Ladisla\nhad been standing—\n“No, I beg of you, no!” squealed a voice. The heir to the throne of the\nUnion was lying on his back in a hollow in the dirt, half-obscured by the\ntwisted corpse of one of his guards. His eyes were squeezed shut, arms\ncrossed in front of his face, white uniform spotted with red blood, caked\nwith black mud. “There will be a ransom!” he whimpered. “A ransom!\nMore than you can imagine.” One eye peered out from between his fingers.\nHe grabbed at West’s hand. “Colonel West! Is it you? You’re alive!”\nThere was no time for pleasantries. “Your Highness, we have to go!”\n“Go?” mumbled Ladisla, his face streaked with tear tracks. “But\nsurely… you can’t mean… have we won?”\nWest nearly bit his own tongue off. It was bizarre that the task should\nfall to him, but he had to save the Prince. The vain and useless idiot might\nnot deserve saving, but that changed nothing. It was for his own sake that\nWest had to do it, not for Ladisla’s. It was his duty, as a subject to save his\nfuture King, as a soldier to save his General, as one man to save another. It\nwas all he could do, now. “You are the heir to the throne and cannot be\nspared.” West reached down and grabbed the Prince by the elbow.\nLadisla fumbled with his belt. “I lost my sword somewhere—”\n“We have no time!” West hauled him up, fully prepared to carry him if"

He struck off through the mist, the two convicts close behind\nhim.\n“Are you sure this is the right way?” growled Pike.\n“I’m sure.” He was anything but. The mist was thicker than ever. The\npounding in his head and the blood trickling into his eye made it hard to\nconcentrate. The sounds of fighting seemed to come from all around:\nclashing and grating metal, groans and wails and yells of fury, all echoing in\nthe mist and seeming one moment far away, the next terrifyingly near.\nShapes loomed and moved and swam, vague and threatening outlines,\nshadows drifting, just out of sight. A rider seemed to rise out of the mist,\nand West gasped and raised his sword. The clouds swirled. It was only a\nsupply cart, laden down with barrels, mule standing still before it, driver\nsprawled out beside, with a broken spear sticking from his back.\n“This way,” hissed West, scuttling towards it, trying to keep close to the\nmud. Carts were good. Carts meant the baggage train, the supplies, the\nfood, and the surgeons. Carts meant they were heading up out of the valley,\naway from the front lines at least, if there still were any such things. West\nthought about it for a moment. Carts were bad. Carts meant plunder. The\nNorthmen would swarm to them like flies to honey, eager for booty. He\npointed off into the mist, away from the empty wagons, the broken barrels,\nthe upended boxes, and the others followed him, silent but for their\nsquelching footfalls, their rasping breath.\nThey slogged on, over open ground, dirty clumps of wet grass, gently\nrising. The others passed him, one by one, and he waved them on. Their\nonly chance was to keep moving, but every step was harder than the one\nbefore. Blood from the cut on his scalp was tickling away under his hair,\ndown the side of his face. The pain in his head was growing worse, not\nbetter. He felt weak, sick, horribly dizzy. He clung to the grip of the heavy\nsword as though it was keeping him up, bent over double, struggling to stay\non his feet.\n“You alright?” asked Cathil.\n“Keep moving!” he managed to grunt at her. He could hear hooves, or\nthought that he could. Fear kept him going, and fear alone. He could see the\nothers, ahead of him, labouring forward. Prince Ladisla well in front, Pike\nnext, Cathil just ahead, looking back over her shoulder. There was a group\nof trees, he could see them through the thinning mist. He fixed on their\nghostly shapes and made for them, his breath rasping in his throat as he\nfloundered up the slope.\nHe heard Cathil’s voice. “No.” He turned, horror creeping up his throat.\nHe saw the outline of a rider, not far behind them.\n“Make for the trees!” he gasped. She didn’t move, so he grabbed her\narm and shoved her forward, fell on his face in the mud as he did it. He"

He\nrolled over, floundered up, began to stumble away from her, away from the\ntrees, away from safety, sideways across the slope. He watched the\nNorthman take shape as he rode up out of the mist. He had seen West now,\nwas trotting up towards him, his spear lowered.\nWest carried on creeping sideways, legs burning, lungs burning, using\nhis last grains of strength to lead the rider away. Ladisla was already in the\ntrees. Pike was just sliding into the bushes. Cathil took one last look over\nher shoulder and followed him. West could go no further. He stopped,\ncrouching on the hillside, too tired even to stand, let alone fight, and\nwatched the Northman come on. The sun had broken through the clouds,\nwas glinting on the blade of his spear. West had no idea what he would do\nwhen he arrived. Apart from die.\nThen the horseman reared up in his saddle, scrabbled at his side. There\nwere feathers there. Grey feathers, blowing in the wind. He let go a short\nscream. His scream stopped, and he stared at West. There was an arrowhead\nsticking out of his neck. He dropped his spear and tumbled slowly\nbackwards out of his saddle. His horse trotted past, curved away up the\nslope, slowed to a walk, and stopped.\nWest crouched against the wet ground for a moment, unable to\nunderstand how he had escaped death. He tottered towards the trees, each\nstride a vast undertaking, all his joints floppy as a puppet’s. He felt his\nknees give way and he crashed down into the brush. There were strong\nfingers plucking at the wound on his scalp, words muttered in Northern.\n“Ah,” yelped West, prising his eyes open a crack.\n“Stop whining.” The Dogman was staring down at him. “Just a scrape.\nYou got off light. Came right to me, but you’re lucky still. I been known to\nmiss.”\n“Lucky,” muttered West. He turned over in the wet bracken and stared\nacross the valley between the tree trunks. The mist was finally starting to\nclear, slowly revealing a trail of broken carts, of broken gear, of broken\nbodies. All the ugly detritus of a terrible defeat. Or a terrible victory, if you\nstood with Bethod. A few hundred strides away he watched a man running\ndesperately towards another stand of trees. A cook maybe, by his clothes. A\nhorseman followed him, spear couched in his arm. He missed at the first\npass, caught him on the way back and knocked him to the ground. West\nshould have felt horror as he watched the rider trot up and stab the helpless\nrunner with his spear, but he only felt a guilty gladness. Glad that it wasn’t\nhim.\nThere were other figures, other horsemen, moving on the slopes of the\nvalley. Other bloody little dramas, but West could watch no more. He turned\naway, slid back down into the welcoming safety of the bushes.\nThe Dogman was chuckling softly to himself. “Threetrees’ll shit when"

He turned\naway, slid back down into the welcoming safety of the bushes.\nThe Dogman was chuckling softly to himself. “Threetrees’ll shit when\nhe sees what I’ve caught me.” He pointed at the strange, exhausted, mud-\nspattered group one by one. “Half-dead Colonel West, girl with a bloody\nhammer, man with a face like the back end of a cook pot, and this one here,\nless I’m deceived, is the boy who had charge o’ this fucking disaster. By the\ndead but fate plays some tricks.” He shook his head slowly, grinning down\nat West as he lay on his back, gasping like a landed fish.\n“Threetrees… is going… to shit.”\nOne for Dinner\nTo Arch Lector Sult, head of His Majesty’s Inquisition.\nYour Eminence,\nI have happy news. The conspiracy is unmasked, and torn up by the\nroots. Korsten dan Vurms, the son of the Lord Governor, and Carlot\ndan Eider, the Magister of the Guild of Spicers, were the principals.\nThey will be questioned, and then punished in such a manner that\nour people will understand the price of treason. It would appear that\nDavoust fell victim to a Gurkish agent, long hidden within the city.\nThe assassin is still at large, but with the plotters in our power it\ncannot be long before we catch him.\nI have had Lord Governor Vurms placed under close arrest. The\ntreason of the son renders the father unreliable, and he has been a\nhindrance in the administration of the city in any case. I will send\nhim back to you by the next ship, so that you and your colleagues on\nthe Closed Council may decide his fate. Along with him will come\none Inquisitor Harker, responsible for the deaths of two prisoners\nwho might otherwise have rendered us valuable information. I have\nquestioned him, and am fully satisfied he had no part in any plot, but\nhe is nonetheless guilty of incompetence tantamount to treason. I\nleave his punishment in your hands.\nThe Gurkish assault came at first light. Picked troops rushed\nforward with ready-made bridges and tall ladders, straight across\nopen ground, and were met with a murderous volley from five\nhundred flatbows ranged along our walls. It was a brave effort, but a\nrash one, and was repulsed with much slaughter on their side. Only\ntwo bold parties made it to our man-made channel, where bridge,\nladder, and men were quickly swept away by a fierce current that\nflows from the sea into the bay at certain times of day, a happy and\nunforeseen chance of nature.\nGurkish corpses now litter the empty ground between our channel\nand their lines, and I have ordered our men to fire upon anyone who\nattempts to offer succour to the wounded. The groans of the dying\nand the sight of Gurkish bodies rotting in the sun cannot but cause a\nuseful weakening of their morale.\nThough the first taste of victory has come to us, in truth, this\nattack was little more than a first feeling out of our defences.

Perhaps they hope\nto take Dagoska intact, but if our resistance holds, this hesitation\ncannot long continue.\nThey certainly do not want for men. More Gurkish soldiers pour\nonto the peninsula every day.

She looked older without her powder and her\njewels, but she still seemed beautiful. More than ever, in a way. The beauty\nof the candle flame that has almost burned out.\n“You look tired,” she said.\nGlokta raised his brows. “It has been a trying few days. First there was\nthe questioning of your accomplice Vurms, then the small matter of an\nassault by the Gurkish army camped outside our walls. You appear\nsomewhat fatigued yourself.”\n“The floor of my tiny cell is not that comfortable, and then I have my\nown worries.” She looked up at Severard and Vitari, leaning against the\nwalls on either side of her, arms folded, masked and implacable. “Am I\ngoing to die in this room?”\nUndoubtedly. “That remains to be seen. Vurms has already told us most\nof what we need to know. You came to him, you offered him money to\nforge his father’s signature on certain documents, to give orders in his\nfather’s name to certain guardsmen, to participate, in short, in the betrayal\nof the city of Dagoska to the enemies of the Union. He has named everyone\ninvolved in your scheme. He has signed his confession. His head, in case\nyou were wondering, is decorating the gate beside that of your friend Islik,\nthe Emperor’s ambassador.”\n“Both together, on the gate,” sang Severard.\n“There are only three things he was not able to give me. Your reasons,\nyour signature, and the identity of the Gurkish spy who killed Superior\nDavoust. I will have those three from you. Now.”\nMagister Eider carefully cleared her throat, carefully smoothed the front\nof her long gown, sat up as proudly as she could. “I do not believe that you\nwill torture me. You are not Davoust.

It couldn’t protect you or anyone else from a stiff\nbreeze.” Glokta sighed, long and hard. The room was too hot, too bright, his\neyes were sore and twitchy and he rubbed at them slowly as he spoke. “You\ncould not even guess at the things that I have done. Awful, evil, obscene, the\ntelling of them alone could make you puke.” He shrugged. “They nag at me\nfrom time to time, but I tell myself I had good reasons. The years pass, the\nunimaginable becomes everyday, the hideous becomes tedious, the\nunbearable becomes routine. I push it all into the dark corners of my mind,\nand it’s incredible the room back there.

Well, Severard?”\n“Any such a what?”\nGlokta gave a sad smile. “You see? He doesn’t even know what one is.”\nHe sagged back in his chair. Tired. Terribly tired. He seemed to lack even\nthe energy to lift his hands. “I have already made all manner of allowances\nfor you. Treason is not normally so gently dealt with. You should have seen\nthe beating that Frost gave to your friend Vurms, and we all know that he\nwas the junior partner in this. He was shitting blood throughout his last few\nmiserable hours. No one has laid a finger on you, yet. I have allowed you to\nkeep your clothes, your dignity, your humanity. You have one chance to\nsign your confession, and to answer my questions. One chance to comply\nutterly and completely. That is the full measure of my conscience.” Glokta\nleaned forward and stabbed at the table with his finger. “One chance. Then\nwe strip you and start cutting.”\nMagister Eider seemed to cave in, all at once. Her shoulders slumped,\nher head fell, her lip quivered. “Ask your questions,” she croaked. A broken\nwoman. Many congratulations, Superior Glokta. But questions must have\nanswers.\n“Vurms told us who was to be paid, and how much. Certain guards.\nCertain officials of his father’s administration. Himself, of course, a tidy\nsum. One name was strangely absent from the list. Your own. You, and you\nalone, asked for nothing. The very Queen of merchants, passing on a certain\nsale?

Why did you betray your\nKing and country?”\n“Why?” echoed Severard.\n“Fucking answer him!” screamed Vitari.\nEider cringed away. “The Union should never have been here in the first\nplace!” she blurted. “Greed is all it was!

The\nSpicers were here before the war, when Dagoska was free. They made\nfortunes, all of them, but they had to pay taxes to the natives, and how they\nchafed at that! How much better, they thought, if we owned the city\nourselves, if we could make our own rules. How much richer we could be.\nWhen the chance came they leaped on it, and my husband was at the front\nof the queue.”\n“And so the Spicers came to rule Dagoska. I am waiting for your\nreasons, Magister Eider.”\n“It was a shambles! The merchants had no interest in running a city, and\nno skill at doing it. The Union administrators, Vurms and his like, were the\nscrapings from the barrel, men who were only interested in lining their own\npockets. We could have worked with the natives, but we chose to exploit\nthem, and when they spoke out against us we called for the Inquisition, and\nyou beat them and tortured them and hung their leaders in the squares of the\nUpper City, and soon they despised us as much as they had the Gurkish.\nSeven years, we have been here, and we have done nothing but evil! It has\nbeen an orgy of corruption, and brutality, and waste!” That much is true. I\nhave seen it for myself.\n“And the irony is, we did not even turn a profit! Even at the start, we\nmade less than before the war! The cost of maintaining the walls, of paying\nfor the mercenaries, without the help of the natives it was crippling!” Eider\nbegan to laugh, a desperate, sobbing laughter. “The Guild is nearly\nbankrupt, and they brought it on themselves, the idiots! Greed, plain and\nsimple!”\n“And then the Gurkish approached you.”\nEider nodded, her lank hair swaying. “I have many contacts in Gurkhul.\nMerchants with whom I have dealt over the years. They told me that\nUthman’s first word as Emperor was a solemn oath to take Dagoska, to\nerase the stain his father had brought upon his nation, that he would never\nrest until his oath was fulfilled. They told me there were already Gurkish\nspies within the city, that they knew our weakness. They told me there\nmight be a way to prevent the carnage, if Dagoska could be delivered to\nthem without a fight.”\n“Then why did you delay? You had control of Cosca and his\nmercenaries, before Kahdia’s people were armed, before the defences were\nstrengthened, before I even arrived. You could have seized the city, if you\nhad wanted. Why did you need that dolt Vurms?”\nCarlot dan Eider’s eyes were fixed on the floor. “As long as Union\nsoldiers held the Citadel, and the city gates, taking them would have meant\nbloodshed. Vurms could give me the city without a fight. My entire\npurpose, believe it or not, the purpose you have so ably frustrated, was to\navoid killing.”\nI do believe it. But that means nothing now. “Go on.”"

But that means nothing now. “Go on.”\n“I knew that Vurms could be bought. His father has not long to live, and\nthe post is not hereditary. The son might only have this last chance to profit\nfrom his father’s position. We fixed a price. We set about the preparations.\nThen Davoust found out.”\n“He meant to inform the Arch Lector.”\nEider gave a sharp laugh. “He had not your commitment to the cause.\nHe wanted what everyone else wanted. Money, and more than I could raise.\nI told the Gurkish that the plan was finished. I told them why. The next day\nDavoust was… gone.” She took a deep breath. “And so there was no going\nback. We were ready to move, shortly after you arrived. All was arranged.\nAnd then…” She paused.\n“Then?”\n“Then you began to strengthen the defences, and Vurms got greedy. He\nfelt that our position was suddenly improved. He demanded more. He\nthreatened to tell you of my plans. I had to go back to the Gurkish to get\nmore. It all took time. Finally we were ready to move again, but by then, it\nwas too late. The chance had passed.” She looked up. “All greed. But for\nmy husband’s greed, we would never have come to Dagoska. But for the\nSpicers’ greed, we might have succeeded here. But for Vurms’ greed, we\nmight have given it away, and not a drop of blood spilled over this\nworthless rock.” She sniffed, and looked back at the floor, her voice\ngrowing faint. “But greed is everywhere.”\n“So you agreed to surrender the city. You agreed to betray us.”\n“Betray who? There would have been no losers! The merchants could\nhave stepped away quietly! The natives would have been no worse off\nunder Gurkish tyranny than they had been under ours! The Union would\nhave lost nothing but a fraction of its pride, and what is that worth beside\nthe lives of thousands?” Eider stretched forward across the table, her voice\ngrowing rough, her eyes wide and shining wet with tears. “Now what will\nhappen? Tell me that. It will be a massacre! A slaughter! Even if you can\nhold the city, what will be the price? And you cannot hold it. The Emperor\nhas sworn, and will not be denied. The lives of every man, woman, and\nchild in Dagoska are forfeit! For what? So that Arch Lector Sult and his like\ncan point at a map, and say this dot or that is ours? How much death will\nsatisfy him? What were my reasons? What are yours? Why do you do this?\nWhy?”\nGlokta’s left eye was twitching, and he pressed his hand against it. He\nstared at the woman opposite through the other. A tear ran down her pale\ncheek and dripped onto the table. Why do I do this?\nHe shrugged. “What else is there?”\nSeverard reached down and slid the paper of confession across the table.\n“Sign!” he barked.\n“Sign,” hissed Vitari, “sign, bitch!”"

It\nrattled against the inside of the inkwell, dripped black spots on the tabletop,\nscratched against the paper. There was no flush of triumph. There never is,\nbut we have one more matter to discuss.\n“Where will I find the Gurkish agent?” Glokta’s voice was sharp as a\ncleaver.\n“I don’t know. I never knew. Whoever it is will come for you now, as\nthey did for Davoust. Perhaps tonight…”\n“Why have they waited so long?”\n“I told them you were no threat. I told them that Sult would only send\nsomeone else… I told them I could handle you.” And so you would have, I\ndo not doubt, were it not for the unexpected generosity of Masters Valint\nand Balk.\nGlokta leaned forward. “Who is the Gurkish agent?”\nEider’s bottom lip was quivering so badly that her teeth were nearly\nrattling in her head. “I don’t know,” she whispered.\nVitari smashed her hand down on the table. “Who? Who? Who is it,\nbitch? Who?”\n“I don’t know!”\n“Liar!” The Practical’s chain rattled over Eider’s head and snapped taut\naround her throat. The onetime Queen of merchants was hauled over the\nback of her chair, legs kicking at the air, hands fumbling at the chain round\nher neck, and flung facedown onto the floor.\n“Liar!” The bridge of Vitari’s nose was screwed up with rage, red brows\ndrawn in with effort, eyes narrowed to furious slits. Her boot ground into\nthe back of Eider’s head, her back arched, the chain cut white into her\nclenched fists. Severard looked down on this brutal scene with a slight smile\naround his eyes, tuneless whistling vaguely audible over the choking,\nhissing, gurgling of Eider’s last breaths.\nGlokta licked at his empty gums as he watched her thrashing on the cell\nfloor. She has to die. There are no options. His Eminence demands harsh\npunishment. His Eminence demands examples be made. His Eminence\ndemands scant mercy. Glokta’s eyelid flickered, his face twitched. The room\nwas airless, hot as a forge. He was damp with sweat, thirsty as hell. He\ncould scarcely draw a breath. He felt almost as if he was the one being\nstrangled.\nAnd the irony is that she is right. My victory is a loss for everyone in\nDagoska, one way or another. Already the first fruits of my labours are\ngroaning their last in the waste ground before the city gates. There will be\nno end to the carnage now. Gurkish, Dagoskan, Union, the bodies will pile\nup until we’re all buried under them, and all my doing. It would be better\nby far if her scheme had succeeded. It would be better by far if I had died in\nthe Emperor’s prisons. Better for the Guild of Spicers, better for the people"

One more thing to scrape into the\ndark corners. One more thing to nag at me when I’m alone. She has to die,\nwhatever the rights and wrongs of it. She has to die. Her next breath was a\nmuffled rattle. The next was a gentle wheeze. Almost done now. Almost\ndone.\n“Stop!” barked Glokta. What?\nSeverard looked up sharply. “What?”\nVitari seemed not to have noticed, the chain was as tight as ever.\n“Stop, I said!”\n“Why?” she hissed.\nWhy indeed? “I give you orders,” he barked, “not fucking reasons!”\nVitari let go the chain, sneering her disgust, and took her boot off the\nback of Eider’s head. She did not move. Her breathing was shallow, a\nrustling scarcely audible. But she is breathing. The Arch Lector will expect\nan explanation, and a good one. What will my explanation be, I wonder?\n“Take her back to the cells,” he said, leaning on his cane and getting wearily\nout of his chair. “We might still find a use for her.”\nG\nlokta stood by the window, frowned out into the night, and watched the\nwrath of God rain down upon Dagoska. The three huge catapults, ranged far\nout of bowshot beyond the city walls, had been in action now since the\nafternoon. It took perhaps an hour for each one to be loaded and made\nready. He had watched the procedure through his eye-glass.\nFirst the machine would be aligned, the range would be judged. A group\nof white-robed, bearded engineers would argue with one another, peering\nthrough eye-glasses of their own, holding up swinging plumb lines, fiddling\nwith compasses, and papers, and abacuses, making minute adjustments to\nthe huge bolts that held the catapult in place.\nOnce they were satisfied, the great arm was bent back into position. A\nteam of twenty horses, well whipped and well lathered, was required to lift\nthe enormous counterweight, a block of black iron carved in the shape of a\nfrowning Gurkish face.\nNext the huge shot, a barrel not much less than a stride across, was\npainstakingly manoeuvred into the waiting scoop by a system of pulleys\nand a team of frowning, bellowing, arm-waving labourers. Then men\nstepped away, hurried back fearfully. A lone slave was sent slowly forward\nwith a long pole, a burning wad at its end. He placed it to the barrel. Flames\nleaped up, and somewhere a lever was hauled down, the mighty weight fell,\nthe great arm, long as a pine trunk, cut through the air, and the burning\nammunition was flung up towards the clouds. They had been flying up, and\nroaring down, for hours now, while the sun slowly sank in the west, the sky\ndarkened around them, the hills of the mainland became a black outline in"

It seemed to\nhang over the city for an age, as high almost as the Citadel itself, and then\ntumbled, crackling from the sky like a meteor, a trail of orange fire blazing\nbehind. It fell to earth in the midst of the Lower City. Liquid flames shot\nupwards, spurted outwards, pounced hungrily upon the tiny silhouettes of\nthe slum-huts. A few moments later, the thunderclap of the detonation\nreached Glokta at his window and made him wince. Explosive powder. Who\ncould have supposed, when I saw it fizzing on the bench of the Adeptus\nChemical, that it might make such an awesome weapon?\nHe half saw, half imagined, tiny figures rushing here or there, trying to\npull the injured from the burning wreckage, trying to save what they could\nfrom their ruined dwellings, chains of ash-blackened natives grimly passing\nbuckets from hand to hand, struggling vainly to contain the spreading\ninferno. Those with the least always lose the most in war. There were fires\nall across the Lower City now. Glowing, shimmering, flickering in the wind\noff the sea, reflecting orange, yellow, angry red in the black water. Even up\nhere, the air smelled heavy, oily and choking from the smoke. Down there it\nmust be hell itself. My congratulations once more, Superior Glokta.\nHe turned, aware of someone in the doorway. Shickel, her slight shape\nblack in the lamplight.\n“I’m alright,” he murmured, looking back to the majestic, the lurid, the\nawful spectacle outside the window. After all, you don’t get to see a city\nburn every day. But his servant did not leave. She took a step forward into\nthe room.\n“You should go, Shickel. I’m expecting a visitor, of a sort, and it could\nbe trouble.”\n“A visitor, eh?”\nGlokta looked up. Her voice sounded different. Deeper, harder. Her face\nlooked different too, one side in shadow, one side lit in flickering orange\nfrom the fires outside the window. A strange expression, teeth half-bared,\neyes fixed on Glokta and glittering with a hungry intensity as she padded\nslowly forward. A fearsome expression, almost. If I was prone to fear…\nAnd the wheels clicked into place.\n“You?” he breathed.\n“Me.”\nYou? Glokta could not help himself. He let out a burst of involuntary\nchuckling. “Harker had you! That idiot stumbled on you by mistake, and I\nlet you go! And I thought I was the hero!” He could not stop laughing.\n“There’s a lesson for you, eh? Never do a good turn!”\n“I don’t need lessons from you, cripple.” She took one more step. Not\nthree strides away from him now.\n“Wait!” He held up his hand. “Just tell me one thing!” She paused, one\nbrow raised, questioning. Just stay there. “What happened to Davoust?”"

Just stay there. “What happened to Davoust?”\nShickel smiled. Sharp, clean teeth. “He never left the room.” She stroked\nher stomach gently. “He is here.” Glokta forced himself not to look up as\nthe loop of chain descended slowly from the ceiling. “And now you can\njoin him.” She got half a step forward before the chain hooked her under the\nchin and jerked up, dragging her off her feet into the air, hissing and\nspitting, kicking and thrashing.\nSeverard sprang up from his hiding place beneath a table, tried to grab\nhold of Shickel’s flailing legs. He yelped as her bare foot cracked into his\nface, sent him sprawling across the carpet.\n“Shit,” gasped Vitari as Shickel wedged her hand under the chain and\nbegan to drag her down from the rafters. “Shit!” They crashed onto the floor\ntogether, struggled for a moment, then Vitari flew through the air, a flailing\nblack shadow in the darkness. She wailed as she crashed into a table in the\nfar corner of the room, flopped senseless on the floor. Severard was still\ngroaning, rolling slowly onto his back in a daze, hands clasped to his mask.\nGlokta and Shickel were left staring at one another. Me and my Eater. This\nis unfortunate.\nHe backed against the wall as the girl sprang at him, but she only got a\nstep before Frost barrelled into her at full tilt, crashed on top of her onto the\ncarpet. They lay there for a moment, then she slowly rolled onto her knees,\nslowly fought her way up to standing, all of the hulking Practical’s great\nweight bearing down on her, slowly took a shuffling step towards Glokta.\nThe albino’s arms were wrapped tight round her, straining with every\nsinew to drag her away, but she kept moving slowly forward, teeth gritted,\none thin arm pinned to her thin body while her free hand clawed out\nfuriously towards Glokta’s neck.\n“Thhhhh!” hissed Frost, the muscles in his heavy forearms bulging, his\nwhite face screwed up with effort, his pink eyes starting from his head. Still\nit was not enough. Glokta was pressed back against the wall, watching\nfascinated as the hand came closer, and closer still, just inches from his\nthroat. This is very unfortunate.\n“Fuck you!” screamed Severard. His stick whistled down and cracked\ninto the grasping arm, breaking it clean in half. Glokta could see the bones\npoking through the ripped and bloody skin, and yet the fingers still\ntwitched, reaching for him. The stick cracked into her face and her head\nsnapped back. Blood sprayed out of her nose, her cheek was cut right open.\nStill she came on. Frost was gasping with the effort of keeping her other\narm pinned as she strained forward, mouth snarling, teeth bared, ready to\nbite Glokta’s throat out.\nSeverard threw down his stick and grabbed her round the neck, dragging\nher head backwards, grunting with the effort, veins pulsing on his forehead."

Slowly, the two\nPracticals began to drag her back. Severard had one of her feet off the floor.\nFrost gave a great bellow, lifted her, and with one last effort flung her\nagainst the wall.\nShe scrabbled at the floor, clawing her way up, broken arm flopping.\nVitari growled from the shadows, one of Superior Davoust’s heavy chairs\nraised high in the air. It burst apart over Shickel’s head with an almighty\ncrash, and then the three Practicals were on her like hounds on a fox,\nkicking, punching, grunting with rage.\n“Enough!” snapped Glokta. “We still have questions!” He shuffled up\nbeside the panting Practicals and looked down. Shickel was a broken mess,\nmotionless. A pile of rags, and not even a big one. Much as when I first\nfound her. How could this girl almost have overcome these three? Her\nbroken arm was stretched out across the carpet, fingers limp and bloody.\nSafe to say no threat to anyone, now.\nThen the arm began to move. The bone slid back into the flesh, made a\nsickening crunching sound as it straightened out. The fingers twitched,\njerked, scratched at the floor, began to slide toward Glokta, reaching for his\nankle.\n“What is she?” gasped Severard, staring down.\n“Get the chains,” said Glokta, cautiously stepping back out of the way.\n“Quickly!”\nFrost dragged two pairs of great irons clanking from a sack, grunting\nwith the effort of lifting them. They were made for the most powerful and\ndangerous of prisoners, bands of black iron, thick as a sapling trunk, heavy\nas anvils. He squeezed one pair tight shut around her ankles, the other round\nher wrists, ratchets scraping into place with a reassuring finality.\nMeanwhile Vitari had hauled a great length of rattling chain from the\nsack and was winding it round and round Shickel’s limp body while\nSeverard held her up, dragging it tight, winding it round and round again.\nTwo great padlocks completed the job.\nThey were snapped shut just in time. Shickel suddenly came alive,\nbegan thrashing on the floor. She snarled up at Glokta, straining at the\nchains. Her nose had already snapped back into place, the cut across her\nface had already closed. As though she was never hurt at all. So Yulwei\nspoke the truth. The chains rattled as she lunged forward with her teeth, and\nGlokta had to stumble back out of the way.\n“It’s persistent,” muttered Vitari, shoving her back against the wall with\nher boot. “You’d have to give it that.”\n“Fools!” hissed Shickel. “You cannot resist what comes!

A moment later the\nthunder of it echoed around the room. Shickel began to laugh, a crazy,\ngrating cackle. “The Hundred Words are coming! No chains can bind them,\nno gates can keep them out! They are coming!”\n“Perhaps.” Glokta shrugged. “But they will come too late for you.”\n“I am dead already! My body is nothing but dust! It belongs to the\nProphet!

He opened his mouth, but she pressed\nher finger to his lips. Firmly.\n“Shhh.”\nShe kissed him. Gently at first, then harder.\n“Uh,” he said.\nHer teeth nipped at his lip. Playful, to begin with.\n“Ah,” he said.\nThey bit harder, and harder still.\n“Ow!” he said.\nShe sucked at his face, her teeth ripping at his skin, scraping on his\nbones. He tried to scream, but nothing came out. It was dark, his head\nswam. There was a hideous tugging, an unbearable pulling on his mouth.\n“Got it,” said a voice. The agonising pressure released.\n“How bad is it?”\n“Not as bad as it looks.”\n“It looks very bad.”\n“Shut up and hold that torch higher.”\n“What’s that?”\n“What?”\n“That there, sticking out?”\n“His jaw, fool, what do you think it is?”\n“I think I’m going to be sick. Healing is not among my remarkable—”\n“Shut your fucking hole and hold the torch up! We’ll have to push it\nback in!” Jezal felt something pressing on his face, hard. There was a\ncracking sound and an unbearable lance of pain stabbed through his jaw and\ninto his neck, like nothing he had ever felt before. He sagged back.\nI\n’ll hold it, you move that.”\n“What, this?”\n“Don’t pull his teeth out!”\n“It fell out by itself!”\n“Damn fool pink!”\n“What’s happening?” said Jezal. But all that came out was a kind of\ngurgle. His head was throbbing, pulsing, splitting with pain.\n“He’s waking up now!”\n“You stitch then, I’ll hold him.” There was a pressure round his\nshoulders, across his chest, folding him tight. His arm hurt. Hurt terribly. He\ntried to kick but his leg was in agony, he couldn’t move it.\n“You got him?”\n“Yes, I’ve got him! Get stitching!”\nSomething stabbed into his face.

In some ways everything had\nchanged. In others it was just the same as ever. Here he was still, facedown\nin the muck with a sore neck from looking up. Ten years older and not a day\nbetter off. He could hardly remember what his ambitions used to be, but this\nhadn’t ever been among ’em, he was sure of that. All that wind blown past,\nall that snow fallen, all that water flowed by.

When do we get a rest?”\nGrim shrugged his shoulders, squeezed his lips together like he was\nthinking about it. “When we’re dead?”\nAnd wasn’t that the sorry truth.\nT\nook Dogman a while to find the others. They were nowhere near where\nthey should’ve been by now. Being honest, they weren’t far from where\nthey were when he left. Dow was the first one he saw, sat on a big stone\nwith the usual scowl on his face, glaring down into a gully. Dogman came\nup next to him, saw what he was looking at. The four Southerners,\nclambering over the rocks, slow and clumsy as newborn calves. Tul and\nThreetrees were waiting for them at the bottom, looking mighty short on\npatience.\n“Bethod’s heading north,” said Dogman.\n“Good for him.”\n“Not surprised?”\nDow licked his teeth and spat. “He’s beat every clan that dared face him,\nmade himself a King where there wasn’t one before, gone to war with the\nUnion and he’s giving ’em a kicking. He’s turned the world on its head, the\nbastard. Nothing he does surprises me now.”\n“Huh.” Dogman reckoned he was right enough there. “You lot ain’t got\nfar.”\n“No we ain’t. This is some right fucking baggage you’ve saddled us\nwith here, and no mistake.” He watched the four of ’em fumbling their way\ndown the gully below, shaking his head like he’d never seen such a waste of\nflesh. “Some right fucking baggage.”"

What should I have done?” asked Dogman. “Left ’em to die?”\n“That’s one idea. We’d be moving twice the speed without ’em, and\neating a deal better and all.” He flashed a nasty grin. “There’s only one that\nI could find a use for.”\nDogman didn’t have to ask which one. The girl was at the back. He\ncould hardly see a woman’s shape to her, all wrapped up as she was against\nthe cold, but he could guess it was under there, and it made him nervous.\nStrange thing, having a woman along. Quite the sorry rarity, since they went\nnorth over the mountains, all them months ago. Even seeing one seemed\nlike some kind of a guilty treat. Dogman watched her clambering on the\nrocks, dirty face half turned towards them. Tough-looking girl, he thought.\nSeemed like she’d had her share of knocks.\n“I reckon she’d struggle,” Dow muttered to himself. “I reckon she’d\nkick some.”\n“Alright, Dow,” snapped Dogman. “Best calm yourself down, lover. You\nknow how Threetrees feels about all that. You know what happened to his\ndaughter. He’d cut your fucking fruits off if he heard you talking that way.”\n“What?” Dow said, all innocence. “I’m just talking, aren’t I? You can’t\nhardly blame me for that. When’s the last time any one of us had a\nwoman?”\nDogman frowned. He knew exactly when it was for him. Pretty much\nthe last time he was ever warm. Curled up with Shari in front of the fire,\nsmile on his face wide as the sea. Just before Bethod chucked him and\nLogen and all the rest of them in chains, then kicked ’em out into exile.\nHe could still remember that last sight of her, mouth open wide with\nshock and fright as they dragged him from the blankets, naked and half-\nasleep, squawking like a rooster that knows it’s about to get its neck\ntwisted. It had hurt, to be dragged away from her. Not as bad as Scale\nkicking him in the fruits had hurt, mind you. A painful night, all in all, one\nhe’d never thought to live through. The sting from the kicks had faded with\ntime, but the ache of losing her never had done, quite.\nDogman remembered the smell of her hair, the sound of her laugh, the\nfeel of her back, pressed warm and soft against his belly while she slept.\nWell-used memories, picked over and worn thin like a favourite shirt. He\nremembered it like it was last night. He had to make himself stop thinking\nabout it. “Don’t know that my memory goes back that far,” he grunted.\n“Nor mine,” said Dow. “Ain’t you getting tired of fucking your hand?”\nHe peered back down the slope and smacked his lips. Had a light in his eyes\nthat Dogman didn’t much like the look of. “Funny, how you don’t miss it so"

Don’t tell me you ain’t thinking the\nsame thing.”\nDogman frowned at him. “I don’t reckon I’m thinking quite the same as\nyou are. Stick your cock in the snow if you have to. That should keep you\ncooled off.”\nDow grinned. “I’ll have to stick it in something soon, I can tell you\nthat.”\n“Aaargh!” came a wail from down the slope. Dogman started for his\nbow, staring to see if some of Bethod’s scouts had caught them out. It was\njust the Prince, slipped and fallen on his arse. Dow watched him rolling on\nhis back, face all squashed up with scorn.\n“He’s some new kind o’ useless, that one, eh? All he does is slow us\ndown to half the rate we need, whine louder than a hog giving birth, eat\nmore ’n his share and shit five times a day.” West was helping him up,\ntrying to brush some of the dirt off his coat. Well, not his coat. The coat that\nWest had given him. Dogman still couldn’t see why a clever man would do\na damn fool thing like that. Not as cold as it was getting now, middle of\nwinter an’ all. “Why the hell would anyone follow that arsehole?” asked\nDow, shaking his head.\n“They say his father’s the King o’ the Union his self.”\n“What does it matter whose son y’are, if you ain’t worth no more than a\nturd? I wouldn’t piss on him if he was burning, the bastard.” Dogman had to\nnod. Neither would he.\nT\nhey all sat in a circle round where the fire would’ve been, if Threetrees\nhad let them have one. He wouldn’t, of course, for all the Southerners’\npleading. He wouldn’t, no matter how cold it got. Not with Bethod’s scouts\nabout. It would have been good as shouting they were there at the tops of\ntheir voices. Dogman and the rest were on one side—Threetrees, Dow and\nTul, Grim propped on his elbow like none of this had aught to do with him.\nThe Union were opposite.\nPike and the girl were putting a brave enough face on being cold, tired,\nand hungry. There was something to them told the Dogman they were used\nto it. West looked like he was near the end of his rope, blowing into his\ncupped hands like they were about to turn black and fall off. Dogman\nreckoned he should’ve kept his coat on, rather than give it to the last of the\nband.\nThe Prince was sitting in the midst, holding his chin high, trying to look\nlike he wasn’t knackered, covered in dirt, and starting to smell as bad as the\nrest of ’em. Trying to look like he might be able to give orders that someone\nmight listen to. Dogman reckoned he’d made a mistake there. A crew like\nhis chose leaders because of what they’d done, not whose son they were."

He didn’t like having to drag this idiot along, let alone\npretend he cared a shit for his opinion.\nIt didn’t help much that not everyone could make sense of everyone\nelse. Of the Union, only West spoke Northern. Of the Northmen, only\nDogman and Threetrees spoke Union. Tul might’ve caught the sense of\nwhat was being said, more or less. Dow weren’t even catching that. As for\nGrim, well, silence means pretty much the same in every tongue.\n“What’s he saying now?” growled Dow.\n“Something about plans, I reckon,” said Tul back to him.\nDow snorted. “All an arsehole knows about is shit.” Dogman saw West\nswallowing. He knew what was being said well enough, and he could tell\nsome folk were running short on patience.\nThe Prince wasn’t near so clever, though. “It would be useful to know\nhow many days you think it will take us to get to Ostenhorm—”\n“We’re not going south,” said Threetrees in Northern, before His\nHighness even finished talking.\nWest stopped blowing into his hands for a moment. “We’re not?”\n“We haven’t been since we set out.”\n“Why?”\n“Because Bethod’s heading back north.”\n“That’s a fact,” said Dogman. “I seen him today.”\n“Why would he turn back?” asked West. “With Ostenhorm\nundefended?”\nDogman sighed. “I didn’t stick around to ask. Me and Bethod ain’t on\nthe best of terms.”\n“I’ll tell you why,” sneered Dow. “Bethod ain’t interested in your city.\nNot yet anyhow.”\n“He’s interested in breaking you up into pieces small enough to chew\non,” said Tul.\nDogman nodded. “Like that one you was with, that he just finished\nspitting out the bones of.”\n“Excuse me,” snapped the Prince, no idea what was being said, “but it\nmight help if we continued in the common tongue—”\nThreetrees ignored him and carried on in Northern. “He’s going to pull\nyour army into little bits. Then he’s going to squash ’em one by one. You\nthink he’s going south, so he hopes your Marshal Burr will send some men\nsouth. He’ll catch ’em napping on his way back north, and if they’re few\nenough, he’ll cut ’em to pieces like he did those others.”\n“Then,” rumbled Tul, “when all your pretty soldiers are stuck back in\nthe mud or run back across the water…”\n“He’ll crack the towns open like nuts in winter, no rush, and his Carls\nwill make free with the contents.” Dow sucked his teeth, staring across at\nthe girl.

She stared\nright back, which was much to her credit, the Dogman thought. He doubted\nhe’d have had the bones to do the same in her position.\n“Bethod’s going north and we’ll be following.” Threetrees said it in a\nway that made it clear it weren’t a matter for discussion. “Keep an eye on\nhim, hope to move fast and keep ahead, so that if your friend Burr comes\nblundering through these woods, we can warn him where Bethod’s at before\nhe stumbles on him like a blind man falling down a fucking well.”\nThe Prince slapped angrily at the ground. “I demand to know what is\nbeing said!”\n“That Bethod is heading north with his army,” hissed West at him\nthrough gritted teeth. “And that they intend to follow him.”\n“This is intolerable!” snapped the fool, tugging at his filthy cuffs. “That\ncourse of action puts us all in danger! Please inform them that we will be\nsetting out southwards without delay!”\n“That’s settled, then.” They all turned to see who spoke, and got quite\nthe shock. Grim, talking Union as smooth and even as the Prince himself.\n“You’re going south. We’re going north. I need to piss.” And he got up and\nwandered off into the dark. Dogman stared after him, mouth open. Why did\nhe need to learn someone else’s language when he never spoke more than\ntwo words together in his own?\n“Very well!” squawked the Prince, shrill and panicky. “I should have\nexpected no better!”\n“Your Highness!” hissed West at him. “We need them! We won’t make it\nto Ostenhorm or anywhere else without their help!”\nThe girl’s eyes slid sideways. “Do you even know which way south is?”\nDogman stifled a chuckle, but the Prince weren’t laughing.\n“We should head south!” he snarled, dirty face twitching with anger.\nThreetrees snorted. “The baggage don’t get a vote, boy, even supposing\nthis was a voting band, which it ain’t.” He was finally speaking Union, but\nDogman didn’t reckon the Prince would be too happy to know what was\nbeing said. “You had your chance to give the orders, and look where it’s got\nyou. Not to mention those were fools enough to do what you told ’em.\nYou’ll not be adding any of our names to their list, I can tell you that. If you\nwant to follow us, you’d best learn to keep up. If you want to give the\norders, well—”\n“South is that way,” said the Dogman, jerking his thumb into the woods.\n“Good luck.”\nScant Mercy\nTo Arch Lector Sult, head of His Majesty’s Inquisition.\nYour Eminence,\nThe siege of Dagoska continues.

Three times they have attacked and three times we have\nthrown them back. Their losses have been heavy, but losses they can\nwell afford. The Emperor’s soldiers crawl like ants across the\npeninsula. Still, our men are bold, our defences are strong, our\nresolve is unshakable, and Union vessels still ply the bay, keeping us\nwell supplied. Be assured, Dagoska will not fall.\nOn a subject of lesser importance, you will, no doubt, be pleased\nto learn that the issue of Magister Eider has been put to rest. I had\nsuspended her sentence while I considered the possibility of using\nher connection with the Gurkish against them. Unfortunately for her,\nthe chances of such subtle measures bearing fruit have dropped\naway, leaving us with no further use for her. The sight of a woman’s\nhead decorating the battlements might have been detrimental to the\nmorale of our troops. We, after all, are the civilised faction. The\nonetime Magister of the Guild of Spicers has therefore been dealt\nwith quietly, but, I can assure you, quite finally. Neither one of us\nneed spare her, or her failed conspiracy, any further thought.\nAs always, Your Eminence, I serve and obey.\nSand dan Glokta,\nSuperior of Dagoska.\nI\nt was quiet down by the water. Quiet, and dark, and still. The gentle waves\nslapped at the supports of the wharf, the timbers of the boats creaked softly,\na cool breeze washed in off the bay, the dark sea glittered in the moonlight\nunder a sky dusted with stars.\nYou could never guess that a few short hours ago men were dying in\ntheir hundreds less than half a mile away. That the air was split with\nscreams of pain and fury. That even now the ruins of two great siege towers\nare still smouldering beyond the land walls, corpses scattered round them\nlike leaves fallen in autumn…\n“Thhhhh.” Glokta felt his neck click as he turned and squinted into the\ndarkness. Practical Frost emerged from the shadows between two dark\nbuildings, peering suspiciously around, herding a prisoner in front of him:\nsomeone much smaller, hunched over and wrapped in a cloak with the hood\nup, arms secured behind them. The two figures crossed the dusty quay and\ncame down the wharf, their footfalls clapping hollow on the wooden planks.\n“Alright, Frost,” said Glokta as the albino pulled his prisoner up. “I\ndon’t think we need that anymore.” The white fist pulled back the cowl.\nIn the pale moonlight, Carlot dan Eider’s face looked gaunt and wasted,\nfull of sharp edges, with a set of black grazes across her hollow cheek. Her\nhead had been shaved, after the fashion of confessed traitors, and without\nthat weight of hair her skull seemed strangely small, almost childlike, her\nneck absurdly long and fragile. Especially with a ring of angry bruises\nround it, the dark afterimages left by the links of Vitari’s chain.

A few weeks in the darkness, sleeping on the rotten floor of a\nsweltering cell, not knowing if you’ll live another hour—that can ruin the\nlooks. I should know.\nShe lifted her chin at him, nostrils wide, eyes gleaming in black\nshadows. That mixture of fear and defiance that comes on some people\nwhen they know they are about to die. “Superior Glokta, I hardly dared\nhope I would see you again.” Her words might have been jaunty, but there\nwas no disguising the edge of fear in her voice. “What now? A rock tied\nround the legs and into the bay? Isn’t that all a touch dramatic?”\n“It would be, but that isn’t what I have in mind.” He looked up at Frost\nand gave the barest of nods. Eider flinched, squeezing her eyes shut and\nbiting on her lip, hunching her shoulders as she felt the hulking Practical\nloom up behind her. Waiting for the crushing blow on the back of the skull?\nThe stabbing point between the shoulder blades? The choking wire across\nthe throat? The terrible anticipation. Which shall it be? Frost raised his\nhand. There was a flash of metal in the darkness. Then a gentle clicking as\nthe key slid smoothly into Eider’s manacles and unlocked them.\nShe slowly prised open her eyes, slowly brought her hands round in\nfront of her, blinked down as though she had never seen them before.\n“What’s this?”\n“This is exactly what it appears to be.” He nodded his head down the\nwharf. “This is a ship leaving for Westport on the next tide. You have\ncontacts in Westport?”\nThe tendons in her thin neck fluttered as she swallowed. “I have contacts\neverywhere.”\n“Good. Then this is me setting you free.”\nThere was a long silence. “Free?” She lifted one hand to her head and\nrubbed absently at her stubbly scalp, staring at Glokta for a drawn-out\nmoment. Not sure whether to believe it, and who can blame her? I’m not\nsure that I believe it. “His Eminence must have mellowed beyond\nrecognition.”\nGlokta snorted. “Not likely. Sult knows nothing about this. If he did, I\nrather think we both might be swimming with rocks round our ankles.”\nHer eyes narrowed. The merchant Queen judges the bargain. “Then\nwhat’s the price?”\n“The price is you’re dead. You’re forgotten. Put Dagoska from your\nmind, it’s finished. Find some other people to save. The price is you leave\nthe Union and never come back. Not. Ever.”\n“That’s it?”\n“That’s it.”\n“Why?”\nAh, my favourite question. Why do I do this? He shrugged. “What does it\nmatter? A woman lost in the desert—”\n“Should take such water as she is offered, no matter who it comes from.\nDon’t worry. I won’t be saying no.” She reached out suddenly, and Glokta\nhalf jerked away, but her fingertips only touched him gently on his cheek.\nThey rested there for a moment, while his skin tingled, and his eye"

Things are as they are.”\nShe let her hand drop, half smiling. “Of course they are. I would say I’ll\nsee you again—”\n“I’d rather you didn’t.”\nShe nodded slowly. “Then goodbye.” She pulled the hood over her head,\nthrowing her face back into shadow, then brushed past Glokta and walked\nquickly towards the end of the wharf. He stood, weight on his cane, and\nwatched her go, scratching his cheek slowly where her fingers had rested.\nSo. To get women to touch you, you need only spare their lives. I should try\nit more often.\nHe turned away, limped a few painful steps onto the dusty quay, peering\nup into the dark buildings. I wonder if Practical Vitari is in there\nsomewhere, watching? I wonder if this little episode will find its way into\nher next report to the Arch Lector? He felt a sweaty shiver up his aching\nback. I won’t be putting it in mine, that’s sure, but what does it really\nmatter? He could smell it, as the wind shifted, the smell that seemed to find\nits way into every corner of the city now. The sharp smell of burning. Of\nsmoke. Of ash. Of death. Without a miracle, none of us will leave this place\nalive. He looked back. Carlot dan Eider was already crossing the gangway.\nWell. Perhaps just one of us will.\nThings are going well,” sang Cosca in his rich Styrian accent, grinning\nout over the parapet at the carnage beyond the walls. “A good day’s work,\nyesterday, considering.”\nA good day’s work. Below them, on the other side of the ditch, the bare\nearth was scarred and burned, bristling with spent flatbow bolts like stubble\non a brown chin. Everywhere, siege equipment lay wrecked and ruined.\nBroken ladders, fallen barrows spilling rocks, burned and shattered wicker\nscreens, trampled into the hard dirt. The shell of one of the great siege\ntowers was still half standing, a framework of blackened timbers sticking\ntwisted from a heap of ash, scorched and tattered leather flapping in the salt\nwind.\n“We taught those Gurkish fuckers a lesson they won’t soon forget, eh,\nSuperior?”\n“What lesson?” muttered Severard. What lesson indeed? The dead learn\nnothing. The corpses were dotted about before the Gurkish front line, two\nhundred strides or so from the land walls. They were scattered across the\nno-man’s-land between, surrounded by a flotsam of broken weapons and\narmour. They had dropped so heavily just before the ditch that you could\nalmost have walked from the sea on one side of the peninsula to the sea on\nthe other without once stepping on the earth.

Not even after the siege of\nUlrioch, when the breach had been choked with Union dead, when Gurkish\nprisoners had been murdered by the score, when the temple had been\nburned with hundreds of citizens inside. Corpses sagged and lolled and\nsprawled, some charred with fire, some bent in attitudes of final prayer,\nsome spread out heedless, heads smashed by rocks flung from above. Some\nhad clothes ripped and rooted through. Where they tore at their own shirts\nto check their wounds, hoping they were not fatal. All of them disappointed.\nFlies buzzed in legions around the bodies. Birds of a hundred species\nhopped and flapped and pecked at the unexpected feast. Even here, high up\nin the blasting wind, it was starting to reek. The stuff of nightmares. Of my\nnightmares for the next few months, I shouldn’t wonder. If I last that long.\nGlokta felt his eye twitching, and he blew out a deep breath, stretched\nhis neck from side to side. Well. We must fight on. It is a little late now for\nsecond thoughts. He peered gingerly over the parapet to take a look down at\nthe ditch, his free hand grasping tight at the pitted stone to keep his balance.\nNot good. “They have nearly filled the channel down below us, and over\nnear the gates.”\n“True,” said Cosca cheerfully. “They drag up their boxes of rocks and\ntry to tip them in. We can only kill them so fast.”\n“That channel is our best defence.”\n“True again. It was a good idea. But nothing lasts forever.”\n“Without it there is nothing to stop the Gurkish mounting ladders,\nrolling up rams, mining under our walls even. It might be necessary to\norganise a sortie of some kind, dig it back out.”\nCosca rolled his dark eyes sideways. “Lowered from the wall by ropes,\nslaving in the darkness, not two hundred strides from the Gurkish positions?\nWas that what you had in mind?”\n“Something like that.”\n“Then I wish you luck with it.”\nGlokta snorted. “I would go, of course.” He tapped his leg with his cane.\n“But I’m afraid my days of heroics are far behind me.”\n“Lucky for you.”\n“Hardly. We should build a barricade behind the gates. That is our\nweakest point. A half circle, I would guess, some hundred strides across,\nwould make an effective killing ground. If they manage to break through,\nwe might still contain them there, long enough to push them back.” Might…\n“Ah, pushing them back.” Cosca scratched at the rash on his neck. “I’m\nsure the volunteers will be falling over each other for that duty when the\ntime comes. Still, I’ll see it done.”\n“You have to admire them.” General Vissbruck strode up to the parapet,\nhis hands clasped tightly behind his impeccably pressed uniform.

There’s more\nthan rhymes in that scabby head, but for the moment we cannot do without\nhim. He glanced at General Vissbruck, who had moved further down the\nwalkway to sulk on his own. Our plump friend has neither the brains nor\nthe bravery to hold this city for longer than a week.\nHe felt a hand on his shoulder, and turned back to Cosca. “What?” he\nsnapped.\n“Uh,” muttered the mercenary, pointing up into the blue sky. Glokta\nfollowed his finger. There was a black spot up there, not far above them, but\nmoving upwards. What is that? A bird? It had peaked now, and was coming\ndown. Realisation dawned suddenly. A stone. A stone from a catapult.\nIt grew larger as it fell, tumbling over and over, seeming to move with\nridiculous slowness, as if sinking through water, its total silence adding to\nthe sense of unreality. Glokta watched it, open-mouthed. They all did. An\nair of terrible expectancy settled on the walls. It was impossible to tell\nexactly where the stone was going to fall. Men began to scatter this way and\nthat along the walkway, clattering, scuffling, gasping, and squealing, tossing\naway weapons.\n“Fuck,” whispered Severard, throwing himself facedown on the stones.\nGlokta stayed where he was, his eyes locked on that one dark spot in the\nbright sky. Is it coming for me? Several tons of rock, about to splatter my\nremains across the city? What a ludicrously random way to die. He felt his\nmouth twitch up in a faint smile.\nThere was a deafening crash as a section of parapet was ripped apart"

He felt his\nmouth twitch up in a faint smile.\nThere was a deafening crash as a section of parapet was ripped apart\nnearby, sending out a cloud of dust and flinging chunks of stone into the air.\nSplinters whizzed around them. A soldier not ten strides away was neatly\ndecapitated by a flying block. His headless body swayed for a moment on\nits feet before its knees buckled and it toppled backwards off the wall.\nThe missile crashed down somewhere in the Lower City, smashing\nthrough the shacks, bouncing and rolling, flinging shattered timbers up like\nmatchsticks, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Glokta blinked and\nswallowed. His ears were still ringing, but he could hear someone shouting.\nA strange voice. A Styrian accent. Cosca.\n“That the best you can do, you fuckers? I’m still here!”\n“The Gurkish are bombarding us!” Vissbruck was squealing pointlessly,\nsquatting down behind the parapet with his hands clasped over his head, a\nlayer of light dust across the shoulders of his uniform. “Solid shot from\ntheir catapults!”\n“You don’t say,” muttered Glokta. There was another mighty crash as a\nsecond rock struck the walls further down and burst apart in a shower of\nfragments, hurling stones the size of skulls into the water below. The very\nwalkway beneath Glokta’s feet seemed to tremble with the force of it.\n“They’re coming again!” Cosca was roaring at the very top of his voice.\n“Man the walls! To the walls!”\nMen began to hurry past: natives, mercenaries, Union soldiers, all side\nby side, cranking their flatbows, handing out bolts, shouting and calling to\none another in a confusion of different languages. Cosca moved among\nthem slapping backs, shaking his fist, snarling and laughing with not the\nslightest sign of fear. A most inspiring leader, for a half-mad drunkard.\n“Fuck this!” hissed Severard in Glokta’s ear. “I’m no damn soldier!”\n“Neither am I, anymore, but I can still enjoy a show.” He limped up to\nthe parapet and peered out. This time he saw the catapult’s great arm fly up\nin the distant haze. The distance was poorly judged this time, and it sailed\nhigh overhead. Glokta winced at a twinge in his neck as he followed it with\nhis eyes. It crashed down not far short of the Upper City’s walls with a deep\nboom, throwing chunks of stone far into the slums.\nA great horn sounded behind the Gurkish lines: a throbbing, rumbling\nblast. Drums followed behind, thumping together like monstrous footsteps.\n“Here they come!” roared Cosca. “Ready with your bows!” Glokta heard\nthe order echoing across the walls, and a moment later the battlements on\nthe towers bristled with loaded flatbows, the bright points of the bolts\nglinting in the harsh sun.\nThe great wicker shields that marked the Gurkish lines began slowly,\nsteadily, to move forward, edging across the blighted no-man’s-land\ntowards them. And behind, no doubt, Gurkish soldiers crawl like ants."

        "text": "steadily, to move forward, edging across the blighted no-man’s-land\ntowards them. And behind, no doubt, Gurkish soldiers crawl like ants.\nGlokta’s hand clutched the stone of the parapet painfully tight as he\nwatched them come on, his heart beating almost as loud as the Gurkish\ndrums. Fear, or excitement? Is there a difference? When was the last time I\nfelt such a bittersweet thrill? Speaking before the Open Council? Leading a\ncharge of the King’s cavalry? Fighting in the Contest before the roaring\ncrowds?\nThe screens were coming steadily closer, still in an even row across the\npeninsula. Now a hundred strides, now ninety, now eighty. He looked\nsideways at Cosca, still grinning like a madman. When will he give the\norder? Sixty, fifty…\n“Now!” roared the Styrian. “Fire!” There was a mighty rattling along the\nwalls as the flatbows were loosed in one great volley, peppering the screens,\nthe ground around them, the corpses, and any Gurkish unlucky enough to\nhave left some part of their body visible. Men knelt behind the parapet and\nbegan to reload, fumbling with bolts, cranking handles, sweating and\nstraining. The drumbeats had grown faster, more urgent, the screens passed\nheedless over the scattered bodies. Not much fun for the men behind,\nstaring down at the corpses beneath their feet, wondering how long before\nthey join them.\n“Oil!” shouted Cosca.\nA bottle with a burning wick was flung spinning from a tower on the\nleft. It smashed against one of the wicker screens and lines of fire shot\nhungrily out across the surface, turning it brown, then black. It began to\nwobble, to bend, then gradually started to tip over. A soldier ran out\nhowling from behind it, his arm wreathed in bright flames.\nThe burning screen fell to the ground, exposing a column of Gurkish\ntroops, some pushing barrows full of boulders, others carrying long ladders,\nothers with bows, armour, weapons. They yelled their war cries, charging\nforward with their shields raised, shooting arrows up at the battlements,\nzigzagging back and forth between the corpses. Men pitched on their faces,\nriddled with flatbow bolts. Men howled and clutched at wounds. Men\ncrawled, and gurgled, and swore. They pleaded and bellowed defiance.\nThey ran for the rear and were shot in the back.\nUp on the walls bows twanged and clanked. More bottles of oil were lit\nand hurled down. Some men roared and hissed and spat curses, some\ncowered behind the parapet as arrows zipped up from below, clattering from\nstone or shooting overhead, occasionally thudding into flesh. Cosca had one\nfoot up on the battlements, utterly careless, leaning out dangerously far and\nbrandishing a notched sword, bellowing something that Glokta could not\nhear. Everyone was screaming and shouting, attackers and defenders both.\nBattle. Chaos. I remember now.

        "text": "Battle. Chaos. I remember now. How could I ever have enjoyed this?\nAnother of the screens was blazing, filling the air with reeking black\nsmoke. Gurkish soldiers spilled out from behind it like bees from a broken\nhive, milling around on the far side of the ditch, trying to find a spot to foot\ntheir ladder. Defenders further down the walls began to hurl chunks of\nmasonry down at them. Another rock from a catapult crashed down far\nshort and ripped a long hole through a Gurkish column, sending bodies and\nparts of bodies flying.\nA soldier was dragged past with an arrow in his eye. “Is it bad?” he was\nwailing. “Is it bad?” A moment later a man just beside Glokta squawked as\na shaft hit him in the chest. He was spun half round, his flatbow went off,\nand the bolt thudded into his neighbour’s neck, right up to the feathers. The\ntwo of them fell together right at Glokta’s feet, leaking blood across the\nwalkway.\nDown at the foot of the walls, a bottle of oil burst apart in the midst of a\ncrowd of Gurkish soldiers, just as they were trying to raise their ladder. A\nfaint tang of cooking meat joined the stinks of rot and wood smoke. Men\nburned, scrambling and screaming, charging around madly or flinging\nthemselves into the flooded ditch in full armour. Death by burning or death\nby drowning. Some choice.\n“You seen enough yet?” Severard’s voice hissed in his ear.\n“Yes.” More than enough. He left Cosca shouting himself hoarse in\nStyrian and pushed breathlessly through the press of mercenaries towards\nthe steps. He followed a stretcher down, wincing at every painful step,\ntrying to keep up while a steady stream of men shoved past the other way.\nNever thought that I’d be glad to be going down a set of steps again. His\nhappiness did not last long, however. By the time he reached the bottom, his\nleft leg was twitching with the all-too-familiar mixture of agony and\nnumbness.\n“Damn it!” he hissed to himself, hopping back against the wall. “There\nare casualties more mobile than I am!” He watched the wounded hobbling\npast, bandaged and bloody.\n“This isn’t right,” hissed Severard. “We’ve done our bit. We found the\ntraitors. What the hell are we still doing here?”\n“Fighting for the King’s cause beneath you, is it?”\n“Dying for it is.”\nGlokta snorted. “You think there’s anyone in this whole fucking city\nenjoying themselves?” He thought he heard the faint sound of Cosca\nscreaming insults floating down over the clamour of the fighting. “Apart\nfrom that crazy Styrian of course. Keep an eye on him, eh, Severard? He\nbetrayed Eider, he’ll betray us, especially if things look bleak.”\nThe Practical stared at him, and for once there was no trace of a smile\nround his eyes. “Do things look bleak?”\n“You were up there.” Glokta grimaced as he stretched his leg out.\n“They’ve looked better.”\nT\nhe long, dim hall had once been a temple.

        "text": "“They’ve looked better.”\nT\nhe long, dim hall had once been a temple. When the Gurkish assaults had\nbegun, the lightly wounded had been brought here, to be tended to by\npriests and women. It was an easy place to bring them: down in the Lower\nCity, close to the walls. This part of the slums was mostly empty of civilians\nnow, in any case. The risks of raging fire and plummeting boulders can\nquickly render a neighbourhood unpopular. As the fighting continued, the\nlightly wounded had gone back to the walls, leaving the more serious\ncasualties behind. Those with severed limbs, with deep cuts, with terrible\nburns, with arrows in the body, lay scattered round the dim arcades on their\nbloody stretchers. Day by day their numbers had mounted until they choked\nevery part of the floor. The walking wounded were dealt with outside, now.\nThis place was reserved for the ruined, for the maimed. For the dying.\nEvery man had his own special language of agony. Some screamed and\nhowled without end. Some cried out for help, for mercy, for water, for their\nmothers. Some coughed and gurgled and spat blood. Some wheezed and\nrattled out their last breaths. Only the dead are entirely silent. And there\nwere a lot of them. From time to time you would see them being dragged\nout, limbs lolling, ready to be wrapped in cheap shrouds and heaped up\nbehind the back wall.\nAll day, Glokta knew, grim teams of men were busy digging graves for\nthe natives. According to their firmly held beliefs. Great pits in the ruins of\nthe slums, good for a dozen corpses at a time. All night, the same men were\nbusy burning the Union dead. According to our lack of belief in anything.\nUp on the bluffs, where the oily smoke will be carried out over the bay. We\ncan only hope it will blow right into the faces of the Gurkish on the other\nside. One last insult, from us to them.\nGlokta shuffled slowly through the hall, which was echoing with the\nsounds of pain, wiping the sweat from his forehead, peering down at the\ncasualties. Dark-skinned Dagoskans, Styrian mercenaries, pale-skinned\nUnion men, all mixed up together. People of all nations, all colours, all\ntypes, united against the Gurkish, and now dying together, side by side, all\nequal. My heart would be warmed, if I still had one. He was vaguely aware\nof Practical Frost, lurking in the darkness by the wall nearby, eyes moving\ncarefully over the room. My watchful shadow, here to make sure that no one\nrewards my efforts on the Arch Lector’s behalf with a fatal head wound of\nmy own.\nA small section at the back of the temple had been curtained off for\nsurgery. Or as close as they can get here. Hack and slash with saw and\nknife, legs off at the knee, arms at the shoulder. The loudest screams in the\nwhole place came from behind those dirty curtains. Desperate, slobbering\nwails. Hardly any less brutal than what’s happening on the other side of the\nland walls. Glokta could see Kahdia working through a gap, his white robe\nspattered, smeared, turned grubby brown with blood. He was squinting"

He was squinting\ndown at some glistening meat while he cut away at it with a blade. The\nstump of a leg, perhaps? The screams bubbled to a stop.\n“He’s dead,” said the Haddish simply, tossing his knife down on the\ntable and wiping his bloody hands on a rag. “Bring in the next one.” He\nlifted the curtain and pushed his way through. Then he saw Glokta. “Ah!\nThe author of our woes! Have you come to feed your guilt, Superior?”\n“No. I came to see if I have any.”\n“And do you?”\nA good question. Do I? He looked down at a young man, lying on dirty\nstraw by the wall, wedged in between two others. His face was waxy pale,\neyes glassy, lips moving rapidly as he mumbled some meaningless\nnonsense to himself. His leg was off just above the knee, the stump bound\nwith a bloody dressing, a belt buckled tight round the thigh. His chances of\nsurvival? Slim to none. A last few hours in agony and squalor, listening to\nthe groans of his fellows. A young life, snuffed out long before his time, and\nblah, blah, blah. Glokta raised his eyebrows. He felt nothing but a mild\ndistaste, no more than he might have, had the dying man been a heap of\nrubbish. “No,” he said.\nKahdia looked down at his own bloody hands. “Then God has truly\nblessed you,” he muttered. “Not everyone has your stomach.”\n“I don’t know. Your people have been fighting well.”\n“Dying well, you mean.”\nGlokta’s laughter hacked at the heavy air. “Come now. There’s no such\nthing as dying well.” He glanced round at the endless wounded. “I’d have\nthought that you of all people would have learned that by now.”\nKahdia did not laugh. “How much of this do you think we can stand?”\n“Losing heart, eh, Haddish? As with so many things in life, heroic last\nstands are a great deal more appealing in concept than in reality.” The\ndashing young Colonel Glokta could have told us that, dragged away from\nthe bridge with the remains of his leg barely attached, his notions of how\nthe world works radically altered.\n“Your concern is touching, Superior, but I’m used to disappointments.\nBelieve me, I will live with this one. The question remains. How long can\nwe hold out?”\n“If the sea lanes stay open and we can be supplied by ship, if the\nGurkish cannot find a way round the land walls, if we can stick together and\nkeep our heads, we could hold out here for weeks.”\n“Hold out for what?”\nGlokta paused. For what indeed? “Perhaps the Gurkish will lose heart.”\n“Hah!” snorted Kahdia. “The Gurkish have no hearts! They did not\nsubdue all Kanta with half measures. No. The Emperor has spoken, and will\nnot be denied.”\n“Then we must hope that the war will be quickly settled in the North,\nand that Union forces will come to our aid.” An utterly futile hope.

It will be\nmonths before matters are settled in Angland. Even when they are, the army\nwill be in no state to fight. We are on our own.\n“And when might we expect such help?”\nWhen the stars go out? When the sky falls in? When I run a mile with a\nsmile on my face? “If I had all the answers, I’d hardly have joined the\nInquisition!” snapped Glokta. “Perhaps you should pray for divine help. A\nmighty wave to wash the Gurkish away would suit nicely. Who was it told\nme that miracles happen?”\nKahdia nodded slowly. “Perhaps we should both pray. I fear there is\nmore chance of aid from my god than from your masters.” Another stretcher\nwas carried past, a squealing Styrian stretched out on it with an arrow in his\nstomach. “I must go.” Kahdia swept away and the curtain dropped back\nbehind him.\nGlokta frowned at it. And so the doubts begin. The Gurkish slowly\ntighten their grip on the city. Our doom draws nearer, and every man sees\nit. A strange thing, death. Far away, you can laugh at it, but as it comes\ncloser it looks worse and worse. Close enough to touch, and no one laughs.\nDagoska is full of fear, and the doubts can only grow. Sooner or later\nsomeone will try to betray the city to the Gurkish, if only to save their lives,\nor the lives of those they love. They might well begin by disposing of the\ntroublesome Superior who set this madness in motion…\nHe felt a sudden touch on his shoulder and he caught his breath and spun\nround. His leg buckled and he stumbled back against a pillar, almost\ntreading on a gasping native with bandages across his face. Vitari was\nstanding behind him, frowning. “Damn it!” Glokta bit on his lip with his\nremaining teeth against a searing spasm in his leg. “Didn’t anyone ever\nteach you not to sneak up on people?”\n“They taught me the opposite. I need to talk to you.”\n“Then talk. Just don’t touch me again.”\nShe eyed the wounded. “Not here. Alone.”\n“Oh, come now. What can you have to say to me that you can’t say in\nfront of a room full of dying heroes?”\n“You’ll find out when we get outside.”\nA chain around the throat, nice and tight, courtesy of His Eminence? Or\nmerely some chat about the weather? Glokta felt himself smiling. I can\nhardly wait to find out. He held one hand up to Frost and the albino faded\nback into the shadows, then he limped after Vitari, threading their way\nthrough the groaning casualties and out through the door at the back, into\nthe open air. The sharp smell of sweat swapped for the sharp smell of\nburning, and something else…\nLong lozenge shapes were stacked up shoulder high against the wall of\nthe temple, swathed in rough grey cloth, some of it spotted and stained with\nbrown blood.

I could hardly have picked a better.\n“So, how are you enjoying the siege? It’s a bit noisy for my taste, but\nyour friend Cosca seems to like it—”\n“Where’s Eider?”\n“What?” snapped Glokta, stalling for time while he thought about how\nto answer. I hardly expected her to find out about that so soon.\n“Eider. You remember? Dressed like an expensive whore? Adornment to\nthe city’s ruling council? Tried to betray us to the Gurkish? Her cell’s\nempty. Why?”\n“Oh, her. She’s at sea.” True. “With fifty strides of good chain round\nher.” False. “She’s adorning the bottom of the bay now, since you ask.”\nVitari’s orange brows drew in with suspicion. “Why wasn’t I told?”\n“I’ve got better things to do than keep you informed. We’ve a war to\nlose, or hadn’t you noticed?” Glokta turned away, but her hand shot out in\nfront of him and slapped onto the wall, her long arm barring his path.\n“Keeping me informed means keeping Sult informed. If we start telling\nhim different stories—”\n“Where have you been the last few weeks?” He chuckled as he gestured\nat the pile of shrouded shapes beside the wall. “It’s a funny thing. The\ncloser the Gurkish get to breaking through our walls and murdering every\nliving thing in Dagoska, the less I seem to care about His fucking\nEminence! Tell him what you please. You’re boring me.” He made to push\npast her arm but found it did not move.\n“What if I were to tell him what you please?” she whispered.\nGlokta frowned. Now, that isn’t boring. Sult’s favourite Practical, sent\nhere to make sure I tread the righteous path, offering deals? A trick? A\ntrap? Their faces were no more than a foot apart, and he stared hard into her\neyes, trying to guess what she was thinking. Is there just the slightest trace\nof desperation there? Could the motive be nothing more than simple self-\npreservation? When you lose the instinct yourself, it’s hard to remember\nhow powerful it is for everyone else. He felt himself starting to smile. Yes, I\nsee it now. “You thought you’d be recalled once the traitors had been found,\ndidn’t you? You thought Sult would arrange a nice little boat home! But\nnow there are no boats for anyone, and you’re worried your kindly uncle’s\nforgotten all about you! That you’ve been tossed to the Gurkish with the\nrest of the damn dogmeat!”\nVitari’s eyes narrowed. “Let me tell you a secret. I didn’t choose to be\nhere any more than you did, but I learned a long time ago that when Sult\ntells you to do a thing you’d better look like you did it. All I care about is\ngetting out of here alive.” She moved even closer. “Can we help each\nother?”\nCan we indeed? I wonder. “Alright then. I daresay I can squeeze one\nextra friend into the social whirl that is my life. I’ll see what I can do for\nyou.”"

Out of practice, you see.” He leered his toothless grin in her face,\nlifted her slack arm out of the way with his cane, then hobbled past the heap\nof bodies and back towards the temple door.\n“What shall I tell Sult about Eider?”\n“Tell him the truth,” Glokta called over his shoulder. “Tell him she’s\ndead.”\nTell him we all are.\nSo This Is Pain\nW\nhere am I?” asked Jezal, only his jaw would not move. The cartwheels\nsquealed as they turned, everything blinding bright and blurry, sound and\nlight digging into his aching skull.\nHe tried to swallow, but could not. He tried to raise his head. Pain\nstabbed through his neck, and his stomach heaved.\n“Help!” he squealed, but nothing came out beyond a bubbling croak.\nWhat had happened? Painful sky above, painful boards underneath. He was\nlying in a cart, head on a scratchy sack, bouncing and jolting.\nThere had been a fight, he remembered that. A fight among the stones.\nSomeone had called out. A crunch and blinding light, then nothing but pain.\nEven trying to think was painful. He lifted his arm to feel his face, but\nfound that he couldn’t. He tried to shift his legs, to push himself up, but he\ncouldn’t do that either. He worked his mouth, grunting, moaning.\nHis tongue was unfamiliar, three times its usual size, like a bloody lump\nof ham that had been shoved between his jaws, filling his mouth so he could\nhardly breathe. The right side of his face was a mask of agony. With every\nlurch of the cart his jaws rattled together, sending white-hot stabs of pain\nfrom his teeth into his eyes, his neck, the very roots of his hair. There were\nbandages over his mouth, he had to breathe through the left side, but even\nthe air moving in his throat was painful.\nPanic started to claw at him. Every part of his body was screaming. One\narm was bound tight across his chest but he clutched weakly at the side of\nthe cart with the other, trying to do something, anything, his eyes bulging,\nheart hammering, breath snorting in his nose.\n“Gugh!” he growled. “Gurrr!” And the more he tried to speak, the more\nthe pain grew, and grew, until it seemed his face would split, until it seemed\nhis skull would fly apart—\n“Easy.” A scarred face swam into view above. Ninefingers. Jezal\ngrabbed at him, wildly, and the Northman caught his hand in his own big\npaw and squeezed it tight. “Easy, now, and listen to me. It hurts, yes. Seems\nlike more than you can take, but it isn’t. You think you’re going to die, but\nyou won’t. Listen to me, because I’ve been there, and I know. Each minute."

You got the light duty, you lucky bastard.”\nJezal let his limbs go heavy. All he had to do was lie there. He squeezed\nthe big hand and the hand squeezed back. The pain seemed less. Awful still,\nbut within his control. His breath slowed. His eyes closed.\nT\nhe wind cut over the cold plain, plucking at the short grass, tugging at\nJezal’s tattered coat, at his greasy hair, at his dirty bandages, but he ignored\nit. What could he do about the wind? What could he do about anything?\nHe sat, his back against the wheel of the cart, and stared down wide-\neyed at his leg. A broken length of spear shaft had been strapped to either\nside, wrapped round and round with strips of torn-up cloth, held firmly and\npainfully straight. His arm was no better, sandwiched between two slats\nfrom a shield and bound tightly across his chest, the white hand dangling,\nfingers numb and useless as sausages.\nPitiful, improvised efforts at medicine that Jezal could never see\nworking. They might almost have seemed amusing, had he not been the\nunfortunate patient. He would surely never recover. He was broken,\nshattered, ruined. Would he be now a cripple of the kind he avoided on the\nstreet corners of Adua? War-wounded, ragged and dirty, shoving their\nstumps in the faces of passersby, holding their crabbing palms out for\ncoppers, uncomfortable reminders that there was a dark side to soldiering\nthat one would rather not think about?\nWould he be now a cripple like… and a horrible coldness crept over\nhim… like Sand dan Glokta? He tried to shift his leg and groaned at the\npain. Would he walk for the rest of his life with a stick? A shambling horror,\nshunned and avoided? A salutary lesson, pointed at and whispered of? There\ngoes Jezal dan Luthar! He used to be a promising man, a handsome man, he\nwon a Contest and the crowd cheered for him! Who would believe it? What\na waste, what a shame, here he comes, let’s move on…\nAnd that was before he even thought about what his face might look\nlike. He tried to move his tongue, and the stab of agony made him grimace,\nbut he could tell there was a terribly unfamiliar geography to the inside of\nhis mouth. It felt slanted, twisted, nothing fitted together as it used to. There\nwas a gap in his teeth that felt a mile wide. His lips tingled unpleasantly\nunder the bandages. Torn, battered, ripped open. He was a monster.\nA shadow fell across Jezal’s face and he squinted up into the sun.\nNinefingers stood over him, a water-skin hanging from one big fist."

It hung bloated and baggy. He\nstruggled for a moment, before realising there was no way of drinking with\nonly one good hand. He fell back, eyes closed, snorting through his nose.\nHe almost ground his teeth with frustration, but quickly thought better of it.\n“Here.” He felt a hand slide behind his neck and firmly lift his head.\n“Gugh!” he grunted furiously, with half a mind to struggle, but in the\nend he allowed his body to sag, and submitted to the ignominy of being\nhandled like a baby. What was the point, after all, in pretending he was\nanything other than utterly helpless? Sour, lukewarm water seeped into his\nmouth, and he tried to force it down. It was like swallowing broken glass.\nHe coughed and spat the rest out. Or he tried to spit and found the pain far\ntoo great. He had to lean forward and let it dribble from his face, most of it\nrunning down his neck and into the filthy collar of his shirt. He sat back\nheavily with a moan and pushed the skin away with his good hand.\nNinefingers shrugged. “Alright, but you’ll have to try again later. Got to\nkeep drinking. You remember what happened?” Jezal shook his head.\n“There was a fight. Me and Sunshine there”—and he nodded over at\nFerro, who scowled back—“handled most of ’em, but it seems three got\naround us. You dealt with two, and you did well with that, but you missed\none, and he hit you in the mouth with a mace.” He gestured at Jezal’s\nbandaged face. “Hit you hard, and you’re familiar with the outcome. Then\nyou fell, and I’m guessing he hit you when you were down, which is how\nyou got the arm and the leg broke. Could have been a lot worse. If I was\nyou, I’d be thanking the dead that Quai was there.”\nJezal blinked over at the apprentice. What did he have to do with\nanything? But Ninefingers was already answering his question.\n“Came up and knocked him on the head with a pan. Well, I say knocked.\nSmashed his skull to mush, didn’t you?” He grinned over at the apprentice,\nwho sat staring out across the plain. “He hits hard for a thin man, our boy,\neh? Shame about that pan, though.”\nQuai shrugged as though he stove a man’s head in most mornings. Jezal\nsupposed he should be thanking the sickly fool for saving his life, but he\ndidn’t feel so very saved. Instead he tried to form the sounds as clearly as he\ncould without hurting himself, making little more than a whisper. “Ow bad\nith it?”"

Instead he tried to form the sounds as clearly as he\ncould without hurting himself, making little more than a whisper. “Ow bad\nith it?”\n“I’ve had worse.” Small comfort indeed. “You’ll get through alright.\nYou’re young. Arm and leg’ll mend quick.” Meaning, Jezal inferred, that\nhis face would not. “Always tough taking a wound, and never tougher than\nthe first. I cried like a baby at every one of these.” Ninefingers waved a\nhand at his battered face. “Most everyone cries, and that’s a fact. If it’s any\nhelp.”\nIt was not. “Ow bad?”\nNinefingers scratched at the thick stubble on the side of his face. “Your\njaw’s broke, you lost some teeth, you got your mouth ripped, but we\nstitched you up pretty good.” Jezal swallowed, hardly able to think. His\nworst fears seemed to be confirmed. “It’s a hard wound you got there, and a\nnasty place to get it. In your mouth so you can’t eat, can’t drink, can’t\nhardly talk without pain. Can’t kiss either of course, though that shouldn’t\nbe a problem out here, eh?” The Northman grinned, but Jezal was in no\nmood to join him. “A bad wound, alright. A naming wound, they’d call it\nwhere I come from.”\n“A wha?” muttered Jezal, immediately regretting it as pain licked at his\njaw.\n“A naming wound, you know.” Ninefingers waggled the stump of his\nfinger. “A wound you could get named after. They’d probably call you\nBrokejaw, or Bentface, or Lackteeth, or something.” He smiled again, but\nJezal had left his sense of humour on the hill among the stones, along with\nhis broken teeth. He could feel tears stinging at his eyes. He wanted to cry,\nbut that made his mouth stretch, the stitches tug at his bloated lips under the\nbandages.\nNinefingers made a further effort. “You got to look at the bright side. It\nain’t likely to kill you now. If the rot was going to get into it, I reckon it\nwould’ve already.” Jezal gawped, horrified, eyes going wider and wider as\nthe implications of that last utterance sank in. His jaw would surely have\ndropped, had it not been shattered and bound tightly to his face. Wasn’t\nlikely to kill him? The possibility of the wound going bad had never even\noccurred. Rot? In his mouth?\n“I’m not helping, am I?” muttered Logen.\nJezal covered his eyes with his one good hand and tried to weep without\nhurting himself, silent sobs making his shoulders shake.\nT\nhey had stopped on the shore of a wide lake. Choppy grey water under a\ndark sky, heavy with bruises. Brooding water, brooding sky, all seeming full\nof secrets, full of threats. Sullen waves slapped at the cold shingle.

        "text": "every corner of Jezal’s body, and would not stop.\nFerro squatted down in front of him, frowning, as always, cutting the\nbandages away while Bayaz stood behind her, looking down. The First of\nthe Magi had woken from his torpor, it seemed. He had given no\nexplanation of what had caused it, or why he had so suddenly recovered,\nbut he still looked ill. Older than ever, and a lot bonier, his eyes sunken, his\nskin looking somehow thin, pale, almost transparent. But Jezal had no\nsympathy to spare, especially not for the architect of this disaster.\n“Where are we?” he muttered through the twinges. It was less painful to\ntalk than it had been, but he still had to speak quietly, carefully, the words\nthick and stumbling like some village half-wit’s.\nBayaz nodded over his shoulder towards the great expanse of water.\n“This is the first of the three lakes. We are well on the way to Aulcus. More\nthan half of our journey is behind us, I would say.”\nJezal swallowed. Halfway was hardly the greatest reassurance he could\nhave asked for. “How long was—”\n“I can’t work with you flapping your lips, fool,” hissed Ferro. “Do I\nleave you like this, or do you shut up?”\nJezal shut up. She peeled the dressing carefully from his face, peered\ndown at the brown blood on the cloth, sniffed it, wrinkled her nose, and\ntossed it away, then stared angrily at his mouth for a moment. He\nswallowed, watching her dark face for any sign of what she might be\nthinking. He would have given his teeth for a mirror at that moment, if he\nhad still had a full set. “How bad is it?” he muttered at her, tasting blood on\nhis tongue.\nShe scowled up at him. “You’ve confused me with someone who cares.”\nA sob coughed up from his throat. Tears stung at his eyes, he had to look\naway and blink to stop himself from crying. He was a pitiable specimen,\nalright. A brave son of the Union, a bold officer of the King’s Own, a\nwinner of the Contest no less, and he could scarcely keep from weeping.\n“Hold this,” snapped Ferro’s voice.\n“Uh,” he whispered, trying to press the sobs down into his chest and\nstop them from cracking his voice. He held one end of the fresh bandage\nagainst his face while she wrapped it round his head and under his jaw,\nround and round, holding his mouth near shut.\n“You’ll live.”\n“Is that supposed to be a comfort?” he mumbled.\nShe shrugged as she turned away. “There are plenty who don’t.”\nJezal almost envied them as he watched her stalk off through the waving\ngrass. How he wished Ardee was here. He remembered the last sight of her,\nlooking up at him in the soft rain with that crooked smile. She would never\nhave left him like this, helpless and in pain. She would have spoken soft\nwords, and touched his face, and looked at him with her dark eyes, and\nkissed him gently, and… sentimental shit. Probably she had found some\nother idiot to tease, and confuse, and make miserable, and had never paid"

He tortured himself with the thought of\nher laughing at some other man’s jokes, smiling into some other man’s face,\nkissing some other man’s mouth. She would never want him now, that was\nsure. No one would want him. He felt his lip trembling again, his eyes\ntingling.\n“All the great heroes of old, you know—the great Kings, the great\nGenerals—they all faced adversity from time to time.” Jezal looked up. He\nhad almost forgotten that Bayaz was there. “Suffering is what gives a man\nstrength, my boy, just as the steel most hammered turns out the hardest.”\nThe old man winced as he squatted down beside Jezal. “Anyone can\nface ease and success with confidence. It is the way we face trouble and\nmisfortune that defines us. Self-pity goes with selfishness, and there is\nnothing more to be deplored in a leader than that. Selfishness belongs to\nchildren, and to half-wits. A great leader puts others before himself. You\nwould be surprised how acting so makes it easier to bear one’s own\ntroubles. In order to act like a King, one need only treat everyone else like\none.” And he placed a hand on Jezal’s shoulder. Perhaps it was supposed to\nbe a fatherly and reassuring touch, but he could feel it trembling through his\nshirt. Bayaz let it rest there for a moment as though he had not the strength\nto move it, then pushed himself slowly up, stretched his legs, and shuffled\noff.\nJezal stared vacantly after him. A few weeks ago he would have been\nleft fuming silently by such a lecture. Now he sat limp, and absorbed it\nmeekly. He hardly knew who he was anymore. It was difficult to maintain\nany sense of superiority in the face of his utter dependence on other people.\nAnd people of whom, until recently, he had held such a very low opinion.\nHe was no longer under any illusions. Without Ferro’s savage doctoring,\nand Ninefingers’ clumsy nursing, he would most likely have been dead.\nThe Northman was walking over, boots crunching in the shingle. Time\nto go back in the cart. Time for more squeaking and jolting. Time for more\npain. Jezal gave a long, ragged, self-pitying sigh, but stopped himself\nhalfway through. Self-pity was for children and half-wits.\n“Alright, you know the drill.” Jezal leaned forward, and Ninefingers\nhooked his arm behind his back, the other under his knees, lifted him up\nover the side of the cart without even breathing hard, and dumped him\nunceremoniously among the supplies. Jezal caught his big, dirty, three-\nfingered hand as he was moving away, and the Northman turned to look at\nhim, one heavy brow lifted. Jezal swallowed. “Thank you,” he muttered.\n“What, for this?”\n“For everything.”\nNinefingers looked at him for a long moment, then shrugged. “Nothing\nto it. You treat folk the way you’d want to be treated, and you can’t go far"

You treat folk the way you’d want to be treated, and you can’t go far\nwrong. That’s what my father told me. Forgot that advice, for a long time,\nand I done things I can never make up for.” He gave a long sigh. “Still, it\ndoesn’t hurt to try. My experience? You get what you give, in the end.”\nJezal blinked at Ninefingers’ broad back as he walked over to his horse.\nYou treat folk the way you’d want to be treated. Could Jezal honestly say\nthat he had ever done that much? He thought about it as the cart set off,\naxles shrieking, carelessly at first, and then with deepening worry.\nHe had bullied his juniors, pandered to his seniors. He had often\nscrewed money from friends who could not afford it, had taken advantage\nof girls, then brushed them off. He had never once thanked his friend West\nfor any of his help, and would happily have bedded his sister behind his\nback if she had let him. He realised, with increasing horror, that he could\nscarcely think of a single selfless thing that he had ever done.\nHe shifted uncomfortably against the sacks of fodder in the cart. You get\nwhat you give, in the long run, and manners cost nothing. From now on, he\nwould think of others first. He would treat everyone as if they were his\nequal. But later, of course. There would be plenty of time to be a better man\nwhen he could eat again. He touched one hand to the bandages on his face,\nscratched absently at them, then had to stop himself. Bayaz was riding just\nbehind the cart, looking out across the water.\n“You saw it?” Jezal muttered at him.\n“Saw what?”\n“This.” He jabbed a finger at his face.\n“Ah, that. Yes, I saw it.”\n“How bad is it?”\nBayaz cocked his head on one side. “Do you know? All in all, I believe I\nlike it.”\n“You like it?”\n“Not now, perhaps, but the stitches will come out, the swelling will go\ndown, the bruises will fade, the scabs will heal and drop away. I would\nguess your jaw will never quite regain its shape, and your teeth, of course,\nwill not grow back, but what you lose in boyish charm you will gain, I have\nno doubt, in a certain danger, a flair, a rugged mystery. People respect a man\nwho has seen action, and your appearance will be very far from ruined. I\ndaresay girls could still be persuaded to swoon for you, if you were to do\nanything worth swooning over.” He nodded thoughtfully. “Yes. All in all, I\nthink it will serve.”\n“Serve?” muttered Jezal, one hand pressed against his bandages. “Serve\nwhat?”\nBut Bayaz’s mind had wandered off. “Harod the Great had a scar, you\nknow, across his cheek, and it never did him any harm. You don’t see it on\nthe statues, of course, but people respected him the more for it, in life. Truly\na great man, Harod. He had a shining reputation for being fair and"

He had a shining reputation for being fair and\ntrustworthy, and indeed he often was. But he knew how not to be, when the\nsituation demanded it.” The Magus chuckled to himself. “Did I tell you of\nthe time he invited his two greatest enemies to negotiate with him? He had\nthem feuding one with the other before the day was out, and later they\ndestroyed each other’s armies in battle, leaving him to claim victory over\nboth without striking a blow. He knew, you see, that Ardlic had a beautiful\nwife…”\nJezal lay back in the cart. Bayaz had, in fact, told him that story before,\nbut there seemed no purpose in saying so. He was actually enjoying hearing\nit for a second time, and it was hardly as though there was anything better\nfor him to do. There was something calming in the repetitive droning of the\nold man’s deep voice, especially now the sun was breaking through the\nclouds. His mouth was barely even hurting, if he kept it still.\nSo Jezal lay back against a sack of straw, head turned to the side,\nrocking gently with the movement of the cart, and watched the land slide\nby. Watched the wind in the grass. Watched the sun on the water.\nOne Step at a Time\nW\nest gritted his teeth as he dragged himself up the freezing slope. His\nfingers were numb, and weak, and trembling from clawing at the chill earth,\nthe icy tree roots, the freezing snow for handholds. His lips were cracked,\nhis nose was endlessly running, the rims of his nostrils were horribly sore.\nThe very air cut into his throat and nipped at his lungs, smoked back out in\ntickling wheezes. He wondered if giving his coat to Ladisla had been the\nworst decision of his life. He decided it probably had been. Except for\nsaving the selfish bastard in the first place, of course.\nEven when he had been training for the Contest, five hours a day, he had\nnever imagined that he could be so tired. Next to Threetrees, Lord Marshal\nVaruz seemed an almost laughably soft taskmaster. West was shaken awake\nbefore dawn every morning and scarcely allowed to rest until after the last\nlight faded. The Northmen were machines, every one of them. Men carved\nfrom wood who never got tired, who felt no pain. Every one of West’s\nmuscles ached from their merciless pace. He was covered in bruises and\nscratches from a hundred falls and scrambles. His feet were raw and\nblistered in his wet boots. Then there was the familiar pulsing in the head,\nthrobbing away to the rhythm of his laboured heartbeat, mingling\nunpleasantly with the burning of the wound on his scalp.\nThe cold, the pain, and the fatigue were bad enough, but still worse was\nthe overwhelming sense of shame, and guilt, and failure that crushed him\ndown with every step. He had been sent with Ladisla to make sure there\nwere no disasters. The result had been a disaster on a scale almost\nincomprehensible. An entire division massacred. How many children\nwithout fathers? How many wives without husbands? How many parents\nwithout sons? If only he could have done more, he told himself for the"

If only he could have done more, he told himself for the\nthousandth time, bunching his bloodless hands into fists. If only he could\nhave convinced the Prince to stay behind the river, all those men might not\nbe dead. So many dead. He hardly knew whether to pity or envy them.\n“One step at a time,” he muttered to himself as he clambered up the\nslope. That was the only way to look at it. If you clenched your teeth hard\nenough, and took enough strides, you could get anywhere. One painful,\nweary, freezing, guilty step at a time. What else could you do?\nNo sooner had they finally made it to the top of the hill than Prince\nLadisla flung himself down against the roots of a tree, as he did at least\nonce an hour. “Colonel West, please!” He gasped for air, breath steaming\nround his puffy face. He had two lines of glistening snot on his pale top lip,\njust like a toddler. “I can go no further! Tell them… tell them to stop, for\npity’s sake!”\nWest cursed under his breath. The Northmen were annoyed enough as it\nwas, and making less and less effort to disguise the fact, but like it or not,\nLadisla was still his commander, not to mention the heir to the throne. West\ncould hardly order him to get up. “Threetrees!” he wheezed.\nThe old warrior frowned over his shoulder. “You better not be asking me\nto stop, lad.”\n“We have to.”\n“By the dead! Again? You Southerners got no bones in you at all! No\nwonder Bethod gave you such a kicking. If you bastards don’t learn to\nmarch, he’ll be giving you another, I can tell you that!”\n“Please. Just for a moment.”\nThreetrees glared down at the sprawling Prince and shook his head with\ndisgust. “Alright, then. You can sit a minute, if that’ll get you moving the\nquicker, but don’t get used to it, you hear? We’ve not covered half the\nground we need to today, if we’re to keep ahead of Bethod.” And he stalked\noff to shout at the Dogman.\nWest sank down onto his haunches, working his numb toes, cupping his\nicy hands and blowing into them. He wanted to sprawl out like Ladisla, but\nhe knew from harsh experience that if he stopped moving, starting up again\nwould be all the more painful. Pike and his daughter stood over them,\nscarcely even too far out of breath. It was harsh proof, if any were really\nneeded, that working metal in a penal colony was better preparation for\nslogging across brutal country than a life of uninterrupted ease.\nLadisla seemed to guess what he was thinking. “You’ve no idea how\nhard this is for me!” he blurted.\n“No, of course!” snapped West, his patience worn down to a stub.\n“You’ve got the extra weight of my coat to carry!”\nThe Prince blinked, then looked down at the wet ground, his jaw\nmuscles working silently. “You’re right.

I realise I owe you my\nlife, of course. Not used to this sort of thing, you see. Not used to it at all.”\nHe plucked at the frayed and filthy lapels of the coat and gave a sorry\nchuckle. “My mother always told me that a man should be well presented\nunder all circumstances. I wonder what she’d make of this.” West noticed\nhe didn’t offer to give it back, though.\nLadisla hunched his shoulders. “I suppose I must shoulder a portion of\nthe blame for this whole business.” A portion? West would have liked to\nserve him a portion of his boot. “I should have listened to you, Colonel. I\nknew it all along. Caution is the best policy in war, eh? That’s always been\nmy motto. Let that fool Smund talk me into rashness. He always was an\nidiot!”\n“Lord Smund gave his life,” muttered West.\n“Shame he didn’t give it a day earlier, we might not be in this fix!” The\nPrince’s lip quivered slightly. “What do you think they’ll say about this\nback home, eh, West? What do you think they’ll say about me now?”\n“I’ve no idea, Your Highness.” It could hardly be any worse than what\nthey said already. West tried to squash his anger and put himself in Ladisla’s\nposition. He was so utterly unprepared for the hardship of this march, so\ncompletely without resources, so entirely dependent on others for\neverything. A man who had never had to make a decision more important\nthan which hat to wear, who now had to come to terms with his\nresponsibility for thousands of deaths. Small wonder he had no idea how to\ngo about it.\n“If only they hadn’t run.” Ladisla clenched his fist and thumped\npetulantly at a tree root. “Why didn’t they stand and fight, the cowardly\nbastards? Why didn’t they fight?”\nWest closed his eyes, did his best to ignore the cold, and the hunger, and\nthe pain, and to push away the fury in his chest. This was always the way of\nit. Just when Ladisla was finally starting to arouse some sympathy, he\nwould let fall some loathsome utterance which brought West’s distaste for\nthe man flooding back. “I couldn’t possibly say, Your Highness,” he\nmanaged to squeeze through his gritted teeth.\n“Right,” grumbled Threetrees, “that’s your lot! On your feet again, and\nno excuses!”\n“Not up again already, is it, Colonel?”\n“I’m afraid so.”\nThe Prince sighed and dragged himself wincing to his feet. “I’ve no\nnotion of how they can keep this up, West.”\n“One stride at a time, Your Highness.”\n“Of course,” muttered Ladisla, starting to stumble off through the trees\nafter the two convicts. “One stride at a time.”\nWest worked his aching ankles for a moment and then bent down to\nfollow, when he felt a shadow fall across him.

He looked up to see that\nBlack Dow had stepped into his path, blocking the way with one heavy\nshoulder, his snarling face no more than a foot away. He nodded towards\nthe Prince’s slow-moving back. “You want me to kill him?” he growled in\nNorthern.\n“If you touch any one of them!” West had spat out the words before he\nhad any idea of how to finish, “I’ll…”\n“Yes?”\n“I’ll kill you.” What else could he say? He felt like a child making\nludicrous threats in a schoolyard. An extremely cold and dangerous\nschoolyard, and to a boy twice his size.\nBut Dow only grinned. “That’s a big temper you got on you for a skinny\nman. A lot of killing we’re talking about, all of a sudden. You sure you got\nthe bones for it?”\nWest tried to look as big as he could, which wasn’t easy standing down a\nslope and hunched over with exhaustion. You have to show no fear if you’re\nto calm a dangerous situation, however much you might be feeling. “Why\ndon’t you try me?” His voice sounded pitifully weak, even in his own ear.\n“I might do that.”\n“Let me know when it’s time. I’d hate to miss it.”\n“Oh, don’t worry about that,” whispered Dow, turning his head and\nspitting on the ground. “You’ll know it’s time when you wake up with your\nthroat cut.” And he sauntered off up the muddy slope, slow enough to show\nhe wasn’t scared. West wished that he could have said the same. His heart\nwas pounding as he pushed on between the trees after the others. He\ntrudged doggedly past Ladisla and caught up to Cathil, falling into step\nbeside her.\n“You alright?” he asked.\n“I’ve been worse.” She looked him up and down. “How about you?”\nWest suddenly realised what a state he must look. He had an old sack\nwith holes cut in it for his arms pulled over his filthy uniform, his belt\nbuckled tight over the top, with the heavy sword pushed through it and\nknocking against his leg. There was an itchy growth of half beard across his\nrattling jaw, and he guessed that his face must have been a mixture of angry\npink and corpse grey. He wedged his hands under his armpits and gave a\nsad grin. “Cold.”\n“You look it. Should have kept your coat, maybe.”\nHe had to nod at that. He peered through the branches of the pines at\nDow’s back and cleared his throat. “None of them have been… bothering\nyou, have they?”\n“Bothering me?”\n“Well, you know,” he said awkwardly, “a woman in amongst all these\nmen, they’re not used to it. The way that man Dow stares at you. I don’t—”\n“That’s very noble of you, Colonel, but I wouldn’t worry about them.

Still had the\nglow of a good free life on my skin, I suppose. He starved me to get what\nhe wanted. Five days with no food.”\nWest winced. “And that was long enough to make him give up?”\n“They don’t give up. Five days was all I could stand. You do what you\nhave to.”\n“You mean…”\n“What you have to.” She shrugged. “I’m not proud, but I’m not ashamed\neither. Pride and shame, neither one will feed you. The only thing I regret is\nthose five days of hunger, five days when I could have eaten well. You do\nwhat you have to. I don’t care who you are. Once you start starving…” She\nshrugged again.\n“What about your father?”\n“Pike?” She looked up at the burnt-faced convict ahead of them. “He’s a\ngood man, but he’s no relative of mine. I’ve no idea what became of my\nreal family. Split up all over Angland probably, if they’re still alive.”\n“So he’s—”\n“Sometimes, if you pretend you’re family, people act differently. We’ve\nhelped each other out. If it wasn’t for Pike, I suppose I’d still be hammering\nmetal in the camp.”\n“Instead of which you’re enjoying this wonderful outing.”\n“Huh. You make do with what you’re given.” She put her head down\nand quickened her pace, stalking off through the trees.\nWest watched her go. She had some bones to her, the Northmen would\nhave said. Ladisla could have learned a thing or two from her tight-lipped\ndetermination. West looked over his shoulder at the Prince, stumbling\ndaintily through the mud with a petulant frown on his face. He blew out a\nsmoky sigh. It seemed that it was far too late for Ladisla to learn anything.\nA\nmiserable meal of a chunk of old bread and a cup of cold stew.\nThreetrees wouldn’t let them have a fire, for all of Ladisla’s begging. Too\nmuch risk of being seen. So they sat and spoke quietly in the gathering\ngloom, a little way from the Northmen. Talking was good, if only to keep\none’s mind from the cold, and the aches, and the discomfort. If only to stop\none’s teeth from chattering.\n“You said you fought in Kanta, eh, Pike? In the war?”\n“That’s right. I was a Sergeant there.” Pike nodded slowly, his eyes\nglittering in the pink mess of his face. “Hard to believe we were always too\nhot, eh?”\nWest gave a sad gurgle. The closest thing to a laugh that he could\nmanage. “Which was your unit?”\n“I was in the First Regiment of the King’s Own Cavalry, under Colonel\nGlokta.”\n“But, that was my regiment!”\n“I know.”\n“I don’t remember you.”\nPike’s burns shifted in a way that West thought might have been a smile.\n“I looked different, back then. I remember you, though. Lieutenant West.\nThe men liked you. Good man to go to with a problem.”"

Good man to go to with a problem.”\nWest swallowed. He wasn’t much for fixing problems now. Only for\nmaking them. “So how did you end up in the camp?”\nPike and Cathil exchanged glances. “In general, among the convicts, you\ndon’t ask.”\n“Oh.” West looked down, rubbed his hands together. “I’m sorry. I didn’t\nmean to offend you.”\n“No offence.” Pike sniffed, and rubbed at the side of his melted nose. “I\nmade some mistakes. Let’s leave it at that. You got a family waiting for\nyou?”\nWest winced, folded his arms tight across his chest. “I have a sister, back\nhome in Adua. She’s… complicated.” He thought it best to end there.\n“You?”\n“I had a wife. When I was sent here, she chose to stay behind. I used to\nhate her for it, but you know what? I can’t say I wouldn’t have done the\nsame.”\nLadisla emerged from the trees, wiping his hands on the hem of West’s\ncoat. “That’s better! Must’ve been that damn meat this morning.” He sat\ndown between West and Cathil, and she scowled as if someone had dropped\na shovelful of shit next to her. It was safe to say the two of them were not\ngetting on. “What were we speaking of?”\nWest winced. “Pike was just mentioning his wife—”\n“Oh? You know, of course, that I am engaged to be married, to the\nPrincess Terez, daughter of Grand Duke Orso of Talins. She is a famous\nbeauty…” Ladisla trailed off, frowning round at the shadowy trees, as if\neven he was dimly aware of how bizarre talk of such matters seemed in the\nwilds of Angland. “Though I am beginning to suspect that she is less than\nentirely delighted with the match.”\n“One can’t imagine why,” murmured Cathil, at least the tenth jibe of the\nevening.\n“I am the heir to the throne,” snapped the Prince, “and will one day be\nyour King! It would not hurt anyone for you to treat me with a measure of\nrespect!”\nShe laughed in his face. “I’ve no country and no King, and certainly no\nrespect for you.”\nLadisla gasped with indignation. “I will not be spoken to like—”\nBlack Dow loomed up over them from nowhere. “Shut his fucking\nmouth!” he snarled in Northern, stabbing at the air with one thick finger.\n“Bethod might have ears anywhere! Stop his tongue flapping, or it’s coming\nout!” and he melted away into the shadows.\n“He would like us to be quiet, Your Highness,” translated West in a\nwhisper.\nThe Prince swallowed. “So I gather.” He and Cathil hunched their\nshoulders and glared at each other in silence.\nW\nest lay on his back on the hard ground, the canvas creaking just above\nhis face, watching the snow fall gently down beyond the black lumps of his"

Cathil was pressed up against him on one side, the Dogman on the\nother. The rest of the band were all around, squeezed in tight together under\na great smelly blanket. All except for Dow, who was out there taking watch.\nCold like this was an amazing thing for making people familiar with each\nother.\nThere was a rumbling snore coming from the far end of the group.\nThreetrees or Tul, probably. The Dogman tended to twitch a lot in his sleep,\njolting and stretching and twittering meaningless sounds. Ladisla’s breath\nwheezed out on the right, chesty-sounding and weak. All sleeping, more or\nless, as soon as they put their heads down.\nBut West could not sleep. He was too busy thinking about all the\nhardships, and the defeats, and the terrible dangers they were in. And not\nonly them. Marshal Burr might be out there in the forests of Angland\nsomewhere, hurrying south to the rescue, not knowing that he was falling\ninto a trap. Not knowing that Bethod was expecting him.\nThe situation was dire, but against all reason, West’s heart felt light. The\nfact was, out here, things were simple. There were no daily battles to be\nfought, no prejudices to overcome, no need to think more than an hour\nahead. He felt free for the first time in months.\nHe winced and stretched his aching legs, felt Cathil shift in her sleep\nbeside him, her head falling against his shoulder, her cheek pressing into his\ndirty uniform. He could feel the warmth of her breath on his face, the\nwarmth of her body through their clothes. A pleasant warmth. The effect\nwas only slightly spoiled by the stink of sweat and wet earth, and the\nDogman squeaking and muttering in his other ear. West closed his eyes, the\nfaintest grin on his face. Perhaps things could still be put right. Perhaps he\nstill had the chance to be a hero. If he could just get Ladisla back alive to\nLord Marshal Burr.\nThe Rest Is Wasted Breath\nF\nerro rode, and watched the land. Still they followed the dark water, still\nthe wind blew cold through her clothes, still the looming sky was heavy\nwith chaos, and yet the country was changing. Where it had been flat as a\ntable, now it was full of rises and sudden, hidden troughs. Land that men\ncould hide in, and she did not like that thought. Not that she was fearful, for\nFerro Maljinn feared no man. But she had to look and listen all the more\ncarefully, for signs that anyone had passed, for signs that anyone was\nwaiting.\nThat was simple good sense.\nThe grass had changed as well. She had grown used to it all around, tall\nand waving in the wind, but here it was short, and dry, and withered pale\nlike straw. It was getting shorter, too, as they went further. Today there were\nbald patches scattered round. Bare earth, where nothing grew. Empty earth,\nlike the dust of the Badlands.\nDead earth."

Empty earth,\nlike the dust of the Badlands.\nDead earth.\nAnd dead for no reason that she could see. She frowned out across the\ncrinkled plain, out towards far distant hills, a faint and ragged line above the\nhorizon. Nothing moved in all that vast space. Nothing but them and the\nimpatient clouds. And one bird, hovering high, high up, almost still on the\nair, long feathers on its dark wingtips fluttering.\n“First bird I seen in two days,” grunted Ninefingers, peering up at it\nsuspiciously.\n“Huh,” she grunted. “The birds have more sense than us. What are we\ndoing here?”\n“Got nowhere better to be.”\nFerro had better places to be. Anywhere there were Gurkish to kill.\n“Speak for yourself.”\n“What? You got a crowd of friends back in the Badlands, all asking after\nyou? Where did Ferro get to? The laughs all dried up since she went away.”\nAnd he snorted as if he had said something funny.\nFerro did not see what. “We can’t all be as well loved as you, pink.” She\ngave a snort of her own. “I’m sure they will have a feast ready for you when\nyou get back to the North.”\n“Oh, there’ll be a feast alright. Just as soon as they’ve hung me.”\nShe thought about that for a minute, looking sideways at him from the\ncorners of her eyes. Looking without turning her head, so if he glanced over\nshe could flick her eyes away and pretend she never was looking at all. She\nhad to admit, now that she was getting used to him, the big pink was not so\nbad. They had fought together, more than once, and he had always done his\nshare. They had agreed to bury each other, if need be, and she trusted him to\ndo it. Strange-looking, strange-sounding, but she had yet to hear him say he\nwould do a thing and see him not do it, which made him one of the better\nmen she had known. Best not to tell him that, of course, or give away the\nslightest sign that she thought it.\nThat would be when he let her down.\n“You got no one, then?” she asked.\n“No one but enemies.”\n“Why aren’t you fighting them?”\n“Fighting? It’s got me everything I have.” And he held his big empty\nhands up to show her. “Nothing but an evil reputation and an awful lot of\nmen with a burning need to kill me. Fighting? Hah! The better you are at it,\nthe worse off it leaves you. I’ve settled some scores, and that can feel grand,\nbut the feeling don’t last long. Vengeance won’t keep you warm nights, and\nthat’s a fact. Overrated. Won’t do on its own. You need something else.”\nFerro shook her head. “You expect too much out of life, pink.”\nHe grinned. “And here was me thinking you expect too little.”\n“Expect nothing and you won’t be disappointed.”\n“Expect nothing and you’ll get nothing.”\nFerro scowled at him.

Somehow it always\ntook her where she did not want to go. Lack of practice, maybe. She jerked\nher reins, and nudged her horse off with her heels, away from Ninefingers\nand the others, out to the side, on her own.\nSilence, then. Silence was dull, but it was honest.\nShe frowned across at Luthar, sitting up in the cart, and he grinned back\nlike an idiot, as wide as he could with bandages over half his face. He\nseemed different somehow, and she did not like it. Last time she had\nchanged his dressings he had thanked her, and that seemed odd. Ferro did\nnot like thanks. They usually hid something. It niggled at her to have done\nsomething that deserved a thanking. Helping others led to friendships.\nFriendships led to disappointment, at best.\nAt worst, betrayal.\nLuthar was saying something to Ninefingers now, talking up to him from\ndown in the cart. The Northman tipped back his head and roared with stupid\nlaughter, making his horse startle and nearly dump him to the ground.\nBayaz swayed contentedly in his saddle, happy creases round the corners of\nhis eyes as he watched Ninefingers fumble with his reins. Ferro scowled off\nacross the plain.\nShe had much preferred it when no one had liked each other. That was\ncomfortable, and familiar. That she understood. Trust, and comradeship, and\ngood humour, these things were so far in the past for her that they were\nalmost unknown.\nAnd who likes the unknown?\nF\nerro had seen a lot of dead men. She had made more than her share. She\nhad buried a good few with her own hands. Death was her trade and her\npastime. But she had never seen near so many corpses all at once. The\nsickly grass was scattered with them. She slid down from her saddle and\nwalked among the bodies. There was nothing to tell who fought who, or one\nside from the other.\nThe dead all look alike.\nEspecially once they have been picked over—their armour, and their\nweapons, and half their clothes taken. They lay heaped thick and tangled in\none spot, in the long shadow of a broken pillar. An ancient-looking thing,\nsplit and shattered, crumbling stone sprouting with withered grass and\nspotted with lichen. A big black bird sat on top of it, wings folded, peering\nat Ferro with beady, unblinking eyes as she came close.\nThe corpse of a huge man was lying half-propped against the battered\nstone below, a broken staff still gripped in his lifeless hand, dark blood and\ndark dirt crusted under the nails. Most likely the staff had held a flag, Ferro\nthought. Soldiers seemed to care a great deal for flags. She had never\nunderstood that. You could not kill a man with one. You could not protect\nyourself with one. And yet men would die for flags.\n“Foolishness,” she muttered, frowning up at the big bird on the pillar.\n“A massacre,” said Ninefingers.\nBayaz grunted and rubbed his chin. “But of who, by whom?”"

Quai was just in front of him on the driver’s seat,\nthe reins dangling loose in his hands, his face expressionless as he looked\ndown at the corpses.\nFerro turned over one of the bodies and sniffed at it. Pale skin, dark lips,\nno smell yet. “It did not happen long ago. Two days, maybe?”\n“But no flies?” Ninefingers frowned at the bodies. A few birds were\nperched on them, watching. “Just birds. And they’re not eating. Strange.”\n“Not really, friend!” Ferro jerked her head up. A man was striding\nquickly towards them across the battlefield, a tall pink in a ragged coat, a\ngnarled length of wood in one hand. He had an unkempt head of greasy\nhair, a long, matted beard. His eyes bulged bright and wild in a face carved\nwith deep lines. Ferro stared at him, not sure how he could have come so\nclose without her noticing.\nThe birds rose up from the bodies at the sound of his voice, but they did\nnot scatter from him. They flew towards him, some settling on his\nshoulders, some flapping about his head and round him in wide circles.\nFerro reached for her bow, snatching at an arrow, but Bayaz held out his\narm. “No.”\n“Do you see this?” The tall pink pointed at the broken pillar, and the bird\nflapped from it and across onto his outstretched finger. “A hundred-mile\ncolumn! One hundred miles to Aulcus!” He dropped his arm and the bird\nhopped onto his shoulder, next to the others, and sat there, still and silent.\n“You stand on the very borders of the dead land! No animals come here that\nare not made to come!”\n“How now, brother?” called Bayaz, and Ferro shoved her arrow\nunhappily away. Another Magus. She might have guessed. Whenever you\nput two of these old fools together, there were sure to be a lot of lips\nflapping, a lot of words made.\nAnd that meant a lot of lies.\n“The Great Bayaz!” shouted the new arrival as he came closer. “The\nFirst of the Magi! I heard tell you were coming from the birds of the air, the\nfish of the water, the beasts of the earth, and now I see with my own eyes,\nand yet still I scarcely believe. Can it be? That those blessed feet should\ntouch this bloody ground?”\nHe planted his staff on the earth, and as he did, the big black bird\nscrambled from his shoulder and grasped the tip with its claws, flapping its\nwings until it was settled. Ferro took a cautious step back, putting one hand\non her knife. She did not intend to be shat on by one of those things.\n“Zacharus,” said Bayaz, swinging down stiffly from his saddle, although\nit seemed to Ferro he said the name with little joy. “You look in good\nhealth, brother.”"

I look tired, and dirty, and mad, for that is what I am. You\nare difficult to find, Bayaz. I have been searching all across the plain and\nback.”\n“We have been keeping out of sight. Khalul’s allies are seeking for us\nalso.” Bayaz’s eyes twitched over the carnage. “Is this your work?”\n“That of my charge, young Goltus. He is fierce as a lion, I tell you, and\nmakes as fine an Emperor as the great men of old! He has captured his\ngreatest rival, his brother Scario, and has shown him mercy.” Zacharus\nsniffed. “Not my advice, but the young will have their way. These were the\nlast of Scario’s men. Those who would not surrender.” He flapped a careless\nhand at the corpses, and the birds on his shoulders flapped with him.\n“Mercy only goes so far,” observed Bayaz.\n“They would not run into the dead land, so here they made their stand,\nand here they died, in the shadow of the hundred-mile column. Goltus took\nthe standard of the Third Legion from them. The very standard that Stolicus\nhimself rode into battle under. A relic of the Old Time! Just as you and I are,\nbrother.”\nBayaz did not seem impressed. “A piece of old cloth. It did these fellows\nprecious little good. Carrying a stretch of moth-food does not make a man\nStolicus.”\n“Perhaps not. The thing is much faded, truth be told. Its jewels were all\ntorn out and sold long ago to buy weapons.”\n“Jewels are a luxury in these days, but everyone needs weapons. Where\nis your young Emperor now?”\n“Already on his way back eastwards with no time even to burn the dead.\nHe is heading for Darmium, to lay siege to the city and hang this madman\nCabrian from the walls. Then perhaps we can have peace.”\nBayaz gave a joyless snort. “Do you even remember what it feels like, to\nhave peace?”\n“You might be surprised at what I remember.” And Zacharus’ bulging\neyes stared down at Bayaz. “But how are matters in the wider world? How\nis Yulwei?”\n“Watching, as always.”\n“And what of our other brother, the shame of our family, the great\nProphet Khalul?”\nBayaz’s face grew hard. “He grows in strength. He begins to move. He\nsenses his moment has come.”\n“And you mean to stop him, of course?”\n“What else should I do?”\n“Hmmm. Khalul was in the South, when last I heard, yet you journey\nwestwards. Have you lost your way, brother? There is nothing out here but\nthe ruins of the past.”\n“There is power in the past.”\n“Power? Hah! You never change. Strange company you ride with,\nBayaz. Young Malacus Quai I know, of course. How goes it, teller of\ntales?” he called out to the apprentice. “How goes it, talker? How does my\nbrother treat you?”"

That I never could make him learn.”\nBayaz frowned up at Quai. “I hardly had to.”\n“So. What did Juvens say? The best lessons one teaches oneself.”\nZacharus turned his bulging eyes on Ferro, and the eyes of his birds turned\nwith him, all as one. “This is a strange one you have here.”\n“She has the blood.”\n“You still need one who can speak with the spirits.”\n“He can.” Bayaz nodded his head at Ninefingers. The big pink had been\nfiddling with his saddle, but now he looked up, bewildered.\n“Him?” Zacharus frowned. Much anger, Ferro thought, but some\nsadness, and some fear. The birds on his shoulders, and his head, and the tip\nof his staff, stood tall and spread their wings, and flapped and squawked.\n“Listen to me, brother, before it is too late. Give up this folly. I will stand\nwith you against Khalul. I will stand with you and Yulwei. The three of us,\ntogether, as it was in the Old Time, as it was against the Maker. The Magi\nunited. I will help you.”\nThere was a long silence, and hard lines spread out across Bayaz’s face.\n“You will help me? If only you had offered your help long ago, after the\nMaker fell, when I begged you for it. Then we might have torn up Khalul’s\nmadness before it put down roots. Now the whole South swarms with\nEaters, making the world their playground, treating the solemn word of our\nmaster with open scorn! The three of us will not be enough, I think. What\nthen? Will you lure Cawneil from her books? Will you find Leru under\nwhatever stone she has crawled beneath in all the wide Circle of the World?\nWill you bring Karnault back from across the wide ocean, or Anselmi and\nBrokentooth from the land of the dead? The Magi united, is it?” And\nBayaz’s lip curled into a sneer. “That time is done, brother. That ship sailed,\nlong ago, never to return, and we were not on it!”\n“I see!” hissed Zacharus, red-streaked eyes bulging wider than ever.\n“And if you find what you seek, what then? Do you truly suppose that you\ncan control it? Do you dare to imagine that you can do what Glustrod, and\nKanedias, and Juvens himself could not?”\n“I am the wiser for their mistakes.”\n“I hardly think so! You would punish one crime with a worse!”\nBayaz’s thin lips and hollow cheeks turned sharper still. No sadness, no\nfear, but much anger of his own. “This war was not of my making, brother!\nDid I break the Second Law? Did I make slaves of half the South for the\nsake of my vanity?”"

How you squabbled with Khalul.\nHow Juvens determined to separate you. How you sought out the Maker,\npersuaded him to share his secrets.” Zacharus laughed, a harsh cackle, and\nhis birds croaked and squawked along with him. “I daresay he never\nintended to share his daughter with you, eh, Bayaz? The Maker’s daughter?\nTolomei? Is there room in your memory for her?”\nBayaz’s eyes glittered cold. “Perhaps the blame is mine,” he whispered.\n“The solution shall be mine also—”\n“Do you think Euz spoke the First Law on a whim? Do you think Juvens\nput this thing at the edge of the World because it was safe? It is… it is evil!”\n“Evil?” Bayaz snorted his contempt. “A word for children. A word the\nignorant use for those who disagree with them. I thought we grew out of\nsuch notions long centuries ago.”\n“But the risks—”\n“I am resolved.” And Bayaz’s voice was iron, and well sharpened. “I\nhave thought for long years upon it. You have said your piece, Zacharus, but\nyou have offered me no other choices. Try and stop me, if you must.\nOtherwise, stand aside.”\n“Then nothing has changed.” The old man turned to look at Ferro, his\ncreased face twitching, and the dark eyes of his birds looked with him.\n“And what of you, devil-blood? Do you know what he would have you\ntouch? Do you understand what he would have you carry? Do you have an\ninkling of the dangers?” A small bird hopped from his shoulder and started\ntwittering round and round Ferro’s head in circles. “You would be better to\nrun, and never to stop running! You all would!”\nFerro’s lip curled. She slapped the bird out of the air, and it clattered to\nthe ground, hopping and tweeting away between the corpses. The others\nsquawked and hissed and clucked their anger, but she ignored them. “You\ndo not know me, old fool pink with a dirty beard. Do not pretend to\nunderstand me, or to know what I know, or what I have been offered. Why\nshould I prefer the word of one old liar over another? Take your birds and\nkeep your nose to your own business, then we will have no quarrel. The rest\nis wasted breath.”\nZacharus and his birds blinked. He frowned, opened his mouth, then\nshut it silently again as Ferro swung herself up into her saddle and jerked\nher horse round towards the west. She heard the sounds of the others\nfollowing, hooves thumping, Quai cracking the reins of the cart, then\nBayaz’s voice. “Listen to the birds of the air, the fish of the water, the beasts\nof the earth. Soon you will hear that Khalul has been finished, his Eaters\nturned to dust, the mistakes of the past buried, as they should have been,\nlong ago.”"

I earnestly hope that you fail.”\n“Look around you, old friend.” And the First of the Magi smiled as he\nclambered up into his saddle. “None of your hopes ever come to anything.”\nAnd so they rode away from the corpses in silence, past the broken\nhundred-mile column and into the dead land. Towards the ruins of the past.\nTowards Aulcus.\nUnder a darkening sky.\nA Matter of Time\nTo Arch Lector Sult, head of His Majesty’s Inquisition.\nYour Eminence,\nSix weeks now, we have held the Gurkish back. Each morning they\nbrave our murderous fire to tip earth and stone into our ditch, each\nnight we lower men from the walls to try and dig it out. In spite of all\nour efforts, they have finally succeeded in filling the channel in two\nplaces. Daily, now, scaling parties rush forward from the Gurkish\nlines and set their ladders, sometimes making it onto the walls\nthemselves, only to be bloodily repulsed.\nMeanwhile the bombardment by catapults continues, and several\nsections of the walls are dangerously weakened. They have been\nshored up, but it might not be long before the Gurkish have a\npracticable breach. Barricades have been raised on the inside to\ncontain them should they make it through into the Lower City. Our\ndefences are tested to the limit, but no man entertains a thought of\nsurrender. We will fight on.\nAs always, Your Eminence, I serve and obey.\nSand dan Glokta,\nSuperior of Dagoska.\nG\nlokta held his breath, licking at his gums as he watched the dust clouds\nsettling across the roofs of the slums through his eye-glass. The last crashes\nand clatters of falling stones faded, and Dagoska, for that one moment, was\nstrangely silent. The world holds its breath.\nThen the distant screaming reached him on his balcony, thrust out from\nthe wall of the Citadel, high above the city. A screaming he remembered\nwell from battlefields both old and new. And hardly happy memories. The\nGurkish war cry. The enemy are coming. Now, he knew, they were charging\nacross the open ground before the walls, as they had done so many times\nthese past weeks. But this time they have a breach.\nHe watched the tiny shapes of soldiers moving on the dust-coated walls\nand towers to either side of the gap. He moved his eye-glass down to take in\nthe wide half circle of barricades, the triple ranks of men squatting behind\nthem, waiting for the Gurkish to come.

        "text": "we have.\nNow Gurkish soldiers began to pour through the yawning breach like\nblack ants swarming from a nest: a crowd of jostling men, twinkling steel,\nwaving banners, emerging from the clouds of brown dust, scrambling down\nthe great heap of fallen masonry and straight into a furious hail of flatbow\nbolts. First through the breach. An unenviable position. The front ranks\nwere mown down as they came on, tiny shapes falling and tumbling down\nthe hill of rubble behind the walls. Many fell, but there were always more,\npressing in over the bodies of their comrades, struggling forward over the\nmass of broken stones and shattered timbers, and into the city.\nNow another cry floated up, and Glokta saw the defenders charge from\nbehind their barricades. Union soldiers, mercenaries, Dagoskans, all hurled\nthemselves towards the breach. At this distance it all seemed to move with\nabsurd slowness. A stream of oil and a stream of water dribbling towards\none another. They met, and it became impossible to tell one side from the\nother. A flowing mass, punctuated by glittering metal, rippling and surging\nlike the sea, a colourful flag or two hanging limp above.\nThe cries and screams hung over the city, echoing, shifting with the\nbreeze. The far-off swell of pain and fury, the clatter and din of combat.\nSometimes it sounded like a distant storm, incomprehensible. Sometimes a\nsingle cry or word would float to Glokta’s ear with surprising clarity. It\nreminded him of the sound of the crowd at the Contest. Except the blades\nare not blunted now. Both sides are in deadly earnest. How many already\ndead this morning, I wonder? He turned to General Vissbruck, sweating\nbeside him in his immaculate uniform.\n“Have you ever fought in a melee like that, General? A straight fight, toe\nto toe, at push of pike, as they say?”\nVissbruck did not pause for a moment from squinting eagerly through\nhis own eye-glass. “No. I have not.”\n“I wouldn’t recommend it. I have only done it once and I am not keen to\nrepeat the experience.” He shifted the handle of his cane in his sweaty palm.\nNot that that’s terribly likely now, of course. “I fought on horseback often\nenough. Charged small bodies of infantry, broke and pursued them. A noble\nbusiness, cutting men down as they run, I earned all kinds of praise for it. I\nsoon discovered a battle on foot is a different matter. The crush is so tight\nyou can hardly take a breath, let alone perform acts of heroism. The heroes\nare the ones lucky enough to live through it.” He snorted with joyless\nlaughter. “I remember being pushed up against a Gurkish officer, as close to\neach other as lovers, neither one of us able to strike, or do anything but\nsnarl at each other. Spear-points digging everywhere, at random. Men\npushed onto the weapons of their own side, or crushed underfoot. More\nkilled by mishap than by design.” The whole business is one giant mishap.\n“An ugly affair,” muttered Vissbruck, “but it has to be done.”\n“So it does. So it does.” Glokta could see a Gurkish standard waving"

        "text": "“An ugly affair,” muttered Vissbruck, “but it has to be done.”\n“So it does. So it does.” Glokta could see a Gurkish standard waving\naround above the boiling throng, silk flapping, tattered and stained. Stones\nflung from the broken walls above began to crash down amongst them. Men\npressed in helpless, shoulder to shoulder, unable to move. A great vat of\nboiling water was upended into their midst from high above. The Gurkish\nhad lost all semblance of order as they came through the breach, and now\nthe formless mass of men began to waver. The defenders pressed in on them\nfrom all sides, relentless, shoving with pike and shield, hacking with sword\nand axe, trampling the fallen under their boots.\n“We’re driving them back!” came Vissbruck’s voice.\n“Yes,” muttered Glokta, peering through his eye-glass at the desperate\nfighting. “So it would seem.” And my joy is limitless.\nThe Gurkish assault had been surrounded, and men were falling fast,\nstumbling back up the hill of rubble towards the breach. Gradually the\nsurvivors were driven out and down into the no-man’s-land behind,\nflatbows on the walls firing into the mass of men as they fled, spreading\npanic and murder. The vague sound of the defenders’ cheering filtered up to\nthem on the walls of the Citadel.\nOne more assault defeated. Scores of Gurkish killed, but there are\nalways more. If they break through the barricades, and into the Lower City,\nwe are finished. They can keep coming as often as they like. We need only\nlose once, and the game is done.\n“It would seem the day is ours. This one, at least.” Glokta limped to the\ncorner of the balcony and peered southwards through his eye-glass, down\ninto the bay and the Southern Sea beyond. There was nothing but calm\nwater, glittering bright to the flat horizon. “And still no sign of any Gurkish\nships.”\nVissbruck cleared his throat. “With the greatest of respect…” Meaning\nnone, I suppose. “The Gurkish have never been sailors. Is there any reason\nto suppose that they have ships now?”\nOnly that an old black wizard appeared in my chambers in the dead of\nnight, and told me to watch out for some. “Simply because we fail to see a\nthing, it does not mean it is not there. The Emperor has us on the rack as it\nis. Perhaps he keeps his fleet in reserve, waiting for a better time, refusing\nto show his whole hand until he needs to.”\n“But with ships, he could blockade us, starve us out, get around our\ndefences! He need not have squandered all those soldiers—”\n“If the Emperor of Gurkhul has one thing in abundance, General, it is\nmore soldiers. They have made a workable breach.” Glokta scanned along\nthe walls until he came to the other weak spot. He could see the great cracks\nin the masonry on the inside, shored up with heavy beams, with heaped-up\nrubble, but still bowing inwards, more each day. “And they will soon have\nanother. They have filled the ditch in four places. Meanwhile our numbers\ndwindle, our morale falters. They don’t need ships.”"

        "text": "another. They have filled the ditch in four places. Meanwhile our numbers\ndwindle, our morale falters. They don’t need ships.”\n“But we have them.” Glokta was surprised to find the General had\nstepped up close beside him and was speaking softly and urgently, looking\nearnestly into his eyes. Like a man proposing marriage. Or treason. I\nwonder which we have here? “There is still time,” muttered Vissbruck, his\neyes swivelling nervously towards the door and back. “We control the bay.\nAs long as we still hold the Lower City, we hold the wharves. We can pull\nout the Union forces. The civilians at least. There are still some wives and\nchildren of officers left in the Citadel, a scattering of merchants and\ncraftsmen who settled in the Upper City and are reluctant to leave. It could\nbe done swiftly.”\nGlokta frowned. True, perhaps, but the Arch Lector’s orders were\notherwise. The civilians can make their own arrangements, if they so desire.\nThe Union troops will not be going anywhere. Except onto their funeral\npyres, of course. But Vissbruck took his silence for encouragement. “If you\nwere to give me the word, it could be done this very evening, and all away\nbefore—”\n“And what will become of us all, General, when we step down onto\nUnion soil? A tearful reunion with our masters in the Agriont? Some of us\nwould soon be crying, I do not doubt. Or should we take the ships and sail\nto far-off Suljuk, do you suppose, to live long lives of ease and plenty?”\nGlokta slowly shook his head. “It is a charming fantasy, but that’s all it is.\nOur orders are to hold the city. There can be no surrender. No backing\ndown. No sailing home.”\n“No sailing home,” echoed Vissbruck sourly. “Meanwhile the Gurkish\npress in closer every day, our losses mount, and the lowest beggar in the\ncity can see that we cannot hold the land walls for much longer. My men\nare close to mutiny, and the mercenaries are considerably less dependable.\nWhat would you have me tell them? That the Closed Council’s orders do\nnot include retreat?”\n“Tell them that reinforcements will be here any day.”\n“I’ve been telling them that for weeks!”\n“Then a few more days should make no difference.”\nVissbruck blinked. “And might I ask when reinforcements will arrive?”\n“Any.” Glokta narrowed his eyes. “Day. Until then we hold.”\n“But why?” Vissbruck’s voice had gone high as a girl’s. “What for? The\ntask is impossible! The waste! Why, damn it?”\nWhy. Always why. I grow bored of asking it. “If you think I know the\nArch Lector’s mind, you’re an even bigger idiot than I supposed.” Glokta\nsucked slowly at his gums, thinking. “You are right about one thing,\nhowever. The land walls may fall at any moment. We must prepare to\nwithdraw into the Upper City.”\n“But… if we abandon the Lower City, we abandon the docks! There can\nbe no supplies brought in! No reinforcements, even if they do arrive! What\nof your fine speech to me, Superior? The walls of the Upper City are too"

If the land walls fall, the city is doomed? We must\ndefeat them there or not at all, you told me! If the docks are lost… there can\nbe no escape!” My dear, plump, pudding of a General, do you not see it?\nEscape has never been an option.\nGlokta grinned, showing Vissbruck the empty holes in his teeth. “If one\nplan fails, we must try another. The situation, as you have so cleverly\npointed out, is desperate. Believe me, I would prefer it if the Emperor\nsimply gave up and went home, but I hardly think we can count on that, do\nyou? Send word to Cosca and Kahdia, all civilians should be moved out of\nthe Lower City tonight. We may need to pull back at a moment’s notice.” At\nleast I won’t have to limp so far to reach the front lines.\n“The Upper City will scarcely hold so many! They will be lining the\nstreets!” Better than lining a grave pit. “They will be sleeping in the\nsquares and the hallways!” Preferable to sleeping in the ground. “There are\nthousands of them down there!”\n“Then the sooner you start the better.”\nG\nlokta half ducked back as he stepped through the doorway. The heat\nbeyond was almost unbearable, the reek of sweat and burnt flesh tickled\nunpleasantly at his throat.\nHe wiped his eyes, already running with tears, on the back of his\ntrembling hand and squinted into the darkness. The three Practicals took\nshape in the gloom. They were gathered round, masked faces lit from\nunderneath by the angry orange of the brazier, all hard bright bone and hard\ndark shadow. Devils, in hell.\nVitari’s shirt was soaked right through and stuck to her shoulders,\nfurious creases cut into her face. Severard was stripped to the waist, gasping\nbreath muffled through his mask, lank hair flapping with sweat. Frost was\nas wet as if he had stood out in the rain, fat drops running down his pale\nskin, jaw muscles locked and bulging. The only one in the room who\nshowed no sign of discomfort was Shickel. The girl had an ecstatic smile\nacross her face as Vitari ground the sizzling iron into her chest. Just as if it\nwere the happiest moment of her life.\nGlokta swallowed as he watched, remembering being shown the brand\nhimself. Remembering pleading, begging, blubbering for mercy.\nRemembering the feeling of the metal pressed into his skin. So searing hot\nit feels almost cold. The mindless din of his own screams. The stink of his\nown flesh burning. He could smell it now. First you suffer it yourself, then\nyou inflict it on others, then you order it done. Such is the pattern of life. He\nshrugged his aching shoulders and hobbled forward into the room.\n“Progress?” he croaked.\nSeverard straightened up, grunting and arching his back, wiped his\nforehead, and flicked sweat onto the slimy floor. “I don’t know about her,\nbut I’m more than halfway to breaking.”"

She won’t say a word. Fucking bitch\nis made of stone.”\n“Softer than stone,” hissed Severard, “but she’s nothing like us.” He\ntook a knife from the table, the blade briefly flashing orange in the darkness,\nleaned forward, and carved a long gash into Shickel’s thin forearm. Her\nface barely even twitched while he did it. The wound hung open, glistening\nangry red. Severard dug his finger into it and twisted it round. Shickel\nshowed not the slightest sign of being in pain. He pulled his finger out and\nheld it up, rubbed the tip against his thumb. “Not even wet. It’s like cutting\ninto a week-old corpse.”\nGlokta felt his leg trembling, and he winced and slid into the spare seat.\n“Plainly, this is not normal.”\n“Unnerthatement,” grunted Frost.\n“But she’s not healing the way she was.” None of the cuts in her skin\nwere closing. All hanging open, dead and dry as meat in a butcher’s shop.\nNor were the burns fading. Charred black stripes across her skin, like meat\nfresh from the grill.\n“Just sits there, watching,” said Severard, “and not a word.”\nGlokta frowned. Can this really be what I had in mind when I joined the\nInquisition? The torture of young girls? He wiped the wet from under his\nstinging eyes. But then, this is both much more and much less than a girl.\nHe remembered the hands clutching at him, the three Practicals straining to\npull her back. Much more and much less than human. We must not make the\nsame mistakes we made with the First of the Magi.\n“We must keep an open mind,” he murmured.\n“Do you know what my father would say to that?” The voice croaked\nout, deep and grinding raw, like an old man’s, oddly wrong from that\nyoung, smooth face.\nGlokta felt his left eye twitching, the sweat trickling under his coat.\n“Your father?”\nShickel smiled at him, eyes glinting in the darkness. It almost seemed as\nif the cuts in her flesh smiled with her. “My father. The Prophet. Great\nKhalul. He would say that an open mind is like to an open wound.\nVulnerable to poison. Liable to fester. Apt to give its owner only pain.”\n“Now you want to talk?”\n“Now I choose to.”\n“Why?”\n“Why not? Now that you know it is my choice, and not yours. Ask your\nquestions, cripple. You should take your chances to learn when you can.\nGod knows you could do with them. A man lost in the desert—”\n“I know the rest.” Glokta paused. So many questions, but what to ask\none such as this? “You are an Eater?”"

        "text": "God knows you could do with them. A man lost in the desert—”\n“I know the rest.” Glokta paused. So many questions, but what to ask\none such as this? “You are an Eater?”\n“We have other names for ourselves, but yes.” She inclined her head\ngently, her eyes never leaving his. “The priests made me eat my mother\nfirst. When they found me. It was that or die, and the need to live was so\nvery great, before. I wept afterwards, but that was long ago and there are no\ntears left in me. I disgust myself, of course. Sometimes I need to kill,\nsometimes I wish to die. I deserve to. Of that I have no doubts. My only\ncertainty.”\nI should have known better than to expect straight answers. One almost\nfeels nostalgic for the Mercers. Their crimes, at least, I could understand.\nStill, any answers are better than none. “Why do you eat?”\n“Because the bird eats the worm. Because the spider eats the fly.\nBecause Khalul desires it, and we are the Prophet’s children. Juvens was\nbetrayed, and Khalul swore vengeance, but he stood alone against many. So\nhe made his great sacrifice, and broke the Second Law, and the righteous\njoined with him, more and more with the passing years. Some joined him\nwillingly. Some not. But none have denied him. My siblings are many now,\nand each of us must make our sacrifice.”\nGlokta gestured at the brazier. “You feel no pain?”\n“I do not, but plentiful remorse.”\n“Strange. It’s the other way around for me.”\n“You, I think, are the lucky one.”\nHe snorted. “Easy to say until you find you can’t piss without wanting to\nscream.”\n“I hardly remember what pain feels like, now. All that was long ago. The\ngifts are different for each of us. Strength, and speed, and endurance beyond\nthe limits of the human. Some of us can take forms, or trick the eye, or even\nuse the Art, the way that Juvens taught his apprentices. The gifts are\ndifferent for each of us, but the curse is the same.” She stared at Glokta,\nhead cocked over to one side.\nLet me guess. “You can’t stop eating.”\n“Not ever. And that is why the Gurkish appetite for slaves is never-\nending. There is no resisting the Prophet. I know. Great Father Khalul.” And\nher eyes rolled up reverently towards the ceiling. “Arch Priest of the\nTemple of Sarkant. Holiest of all whose feet touch the earth. Humbler of the\nproud, righter of wrongs, teller of truths. Light shines from him as it shines\nfrom the stars. When he speaks, it is with the voice of God. When he—”\n“No doubt he shits golden turds as well. You believe all that rubbish?”\n“What does it matter what I believe? I don’t make the choices. When\nyour master gives you a task, you do your best at it. Even if the task is a\ndark one.”\nThat much I can understand. “Some of us are only suited to dark tasks.\nOnce you’ve chosen your master—”\nShickel croaked dry laughter across the table. “Few indeed are those"

We do as we are told. We stand or fall beside those who\nwere born near to us, who look as we do, who speak the same words, and\nall the while we know as little of the reasons why as does the dust we return\nto.” Her head sagged sideways and a gash in her shoulder opened up as\nwide as a mouth. “Do you think I like what I have become? Do you think I\ndo not dream of being as others are? But once the change has come, you\ncan never go back. Do you understand?”\nOh, yes. Few better. “Why were you sent here?”\n“The work of the righteous is never-ending. I came to see Dagoska\nreturned to the fold. To see its people worship God according to the\nProphet’s teachings. To see my brothers and sisters fed.”\n“It seems you failed.”\n“Others will follow. There is no resisting the Prophet. You are doomed.”\nThat much I know. Let us try another tack. “What do you know… about\nBayaz.”\n“Ah, Bayaz. He was the Prophet’s brother. He is the start of this, and\nwill be the end.” Her voice dropped to a whisper. “Liar and traitor. He killed\nhis master. He murdered Juvens.”\nGlokta frowned. “That is not the way I heard the story.”\n“Everyone has their own way of telling every story, broken man. Have\nyou not learned that yet?” Her lip curled. “You have no understanding of\nthe war you fight in, of the weapons and the casualties, of the victories and\nthe defeats, every day. You do not guess at the sides, or the causes, or the\nreasons. The battlefields are everywhere. I pity you. You are a dog, trying to\nunderstand the argument of scholars, and hearing nothing but barking. The\nrighteous are coming. Khalul will sweep the earth clean of lies and build a\nnew order. Juvens will be avenged. It is foretold. It is ordained. It is\npromised.”\n“I doubt you’ll see it.”\nShe grinned at him. “I doubt you will either. My father would rather\nhave taken this city without a fight, but if he must fight for it, then he will,\nand with no mercy, and with the fury of God behind him. That is the first\nstep on the path he has chosen. On the path he has chosen for all of us.”\n“What step comes next?”\n“Do you think my masters tell me their plans? Do yours? I am a worm. I\nam nothing. And yet I am more than you are.”\n“What comes next?” hissed Glokta. Nothing but silence.\n“Answer him!” hissed Vitari. Frost hauled an iron from the brazier, the\ntip glowing orange, and ground it into Shickel’s bare shoulder. Foul-\nsmelling steam hissed up, fat spat and sizzled, but the girl said nothing. Her\nlazy eyes watched her own flesh burn, without emotion. There will be no\nanswers here. Only more questions. Always more questions."

Sound familiar?\nGlokta grimaced as he turned his aching back on the stinking chamber.\n“Burn it,” he said.\nG\nlokta stood on his balcony in the sharp evening, frowning down towards\nthe Lower City.\nIt was windy up here on the rock, a cold wind off the dark sea, whipping\nat Glokta’s face, at his fingers on the dry parapet, slapping the tails of his\ncoat against his legs. The closest thing we’ll get to winter in this cursed\ncrucible. The flames of the torches by the door flapped and flickered in their\niron cages, two lights in the gathering darkness. There were more lights out\nthere, many more. Lamps burned on the rigging of the Union ships in the\nharbour, their reflections flashing and breaking in the water below. Lights\nglowed in the windows of the dark palaces under the Citadel, in the tops of\nthe lofty spires of the Great Temple. Down in the slums, thousands of\ntorches burned. Rivers of tiny points of light, flowing out of the buildings,\nonto the roads, towards the gates of the Upper City. Refugees leaving their\nhomes, such as they are. Heading for safety, such as it is. How long can we\nkeep them safe, I wonder, once the land walls fall? He knew the answer\nalready. Not long.\n“Superior!”\n“Why, Master Cosca. I’m so glad you could join me.”\n“Of course! There’s nothing like a stroll in the evening air after a\nskirmish.” The mercenary strutted over. Even in the gloom, Glokta could\nsee the difference in him. He walked with a spring in his step, a glint in his\neye, his hair neatly brushed, his moustache waxed stiff. An inch or two\ntaller and a good ten years younger, all of a sudden. He pranced to the\nparapet, closed his eyes, and sucked a deep breath through his sharp nose.\n“You look remarkably well for someone who has just fought in a battle.”\nThe Styrian grinned at him. “I wasn’t so much in the battle as just\nbehind it. I’ve always felt the very front is a poor place to fight from. No\none can hear you with all the clatter. That, and the chances of being killed\nthere are really very high.”\n“Doubtless. How did it go for us?”\n“The Gurkish are still outside, so I’d say, as far as battles go, it went"

I doubt the dead would agree with me, but who cares a shit for their\nopinion?” He scratched happily at his neck. “We did well today. But\ntomorrow, and the day after, who can say? Still no chance of\nreinforcement?” Glokta shook his head, and the Styrian took in a sharp\nbreath. “It’s all the same to me, of course, but you may want to consider a\nwithdrawal while we still hold the bay.”\nEveryone would like to withdraw. Even me. Glokta snorted. “The Closed\nCouncil hold my leash, and they say no. The King’s honour will not permit\nit, they inform me, and apparently his honour is more valuable than our\nlives.”\nCosca raised his brows. “Honour, eh? What the hell is that anyway?\nEvery man thinks it’s something different. You can’t drink it. You can’t fuck\nit. The more of it you have the less good it does you, and if you’ve got none\nat all, you don’t miss it.” He shook his head. “But some men think it’s the\nbest thing in the world.”\n“Uh,” muttered Glokta, licking at his empty gums. Honour is worth less\nthan one’s legs, or one’s teeth. A lesson I paid dearly for. He peered towards\nthe shadowy outline of the land walls, studded with burning bonfires. The\nvague sounds of fighting could still be heard, the odd flaming arrow soared\nhigh into the air and fell in the ruined slums. Even now, the bloody business\ncontinues. He took a deep breath. “What are our chances of holding out for\nanother week?”\n“Another week?” Cosca pursed his lips. “Reasonable.”\n“Two weeks?”\n“Two?” Cosca clicked his tongue. “Less good.”\n“Which would make a month a hopeless cause.”\n“Hopeless would be the word.”\n“You seem almost to revel in the situation.”\n“Me? I’ve made a speciality from hopeless causes.” He grinned at\nGlokta. “These days, they’re the only ones that will have me.”\nI know the feeling. “Hold the land walls as long as you can, then pull\nback. The walls of the Upper City must be our next line of defence.”\nCosca’s grin could just be seen shining in the darkness. “Hold as long as\nwe can, and then pull back! I can hardly wait!”\n“And perhaps we should prepare some surprises for our Gurkish guests\nwhen they finally make it past the walls. You know”—Glokta waved his\nhand absently—“tripwires and hidden pits, spikes daubed with excrement\nand so on. You’ve some experience in that type of warfare, I daresay.”\n“I am experienced in all types of warfare.” Cosca snapped his heels\ntogether and gave an elaborate salute. “Spikes and excrement! There’s\nhonour for you.”\nThis is war. The only honour is in winning. “Talking of honour, you’d\nbest let our friend General Vissbruck know where your surprises are. It\nwould be a shame if he were to impale himself by accident.”"

A dreadful shame.”\nGlokta felt his hand bunching into a fist on the parapet. “We must make\nthe Gurkish pay for every stride of ground.” We must make them pay for my\nruined leg. “For every inch of dirt.” For my missing teeth. “For every\nmeagre shack, and crumbling hut, and worthless stretch of dust.” For my\nweeping eye, and my twisted back, and my repulsive shadow of a life. He\nlicked at his empty gums. “Make them pay.”\n“Excellent! The only good Gurkish are the dead ones!” The mercenary\nspun and marched through the door into the Citadel, his spurs jingling,\nleaving Glokta alone on the flat roof.\nOne week? Yes. Two weeks? Perhaps. Any longer? Hopeless. There may\nhave been no ships, but that old riddler Yulwei was still right. And so was\nEider. There never was any chance. For all our efforts, for all our\nsacrifices, Dagoska must surely fall. It is only a matter of time, now.\nHe stared out across the darkened city. It was hard to separate the land\nfrom the sea in the blackness, the lights on the boats from the lights in the\nbuildings, the torches on the rigging from the torches in the slums. All was\na confusion of points of light, flowing around each other, disembodied in\nthe void. There was only one certainty in all of it.\nWe’re finished. Not tonight, but soon. We are surrounded, and the net\nwill only draw tighter. It is a matter of time.\nScars\nO\nne by one, Ferro took out the stitches—slitting the thread neatly with the\nshining point of her knife, working them gently out of Luthar’s skin, dark\nfingertips moving quick and sure, yellow eyes narrowed with concentration.\nLogen watched her work, shaking his head slowly at the skill of it. He’d\nseen it done often, but never so well. Luthar barely even looked to be in\npain, and he always looked to be in pain lately.\n“Do we need another bandage on it?”\n“No. We let it breathe.” The last stitch slid out, and Ferro tossed the\nbloody bits of thread away and rocked back on her knees to look at the\nresults.\n“That’s good,” said Logen, voice hushed. He’d never guessed that it\ncould come out half so well. Luthar’s jaw looked slightly bent in the\nfirelight, like he was biting down on one side. There was a ragged notch out\nof his lip, and a forked scar torn from it down to the point of his chin, pink\ndots on either side where the stitches had been, the skin around it stretched\nand twisted. Nothing more, but for some swelling that’d soon go down.\n“That’s some damn good stitching. I never saw any better. Where’d you\nlearn healing?”\n“A man called Aruf taught me.”\n“Well, he taught you well. Rare skill to have. Happy chance for us that\nhe did it.”\n“I had to fuck him first.”"

Happy chance for us that\nhe did it.”\n“I had to fuck him first.”\n“Ah.” That did shine a bit of a different light on it.\nFerro shrugged. “I didn’t mind. He was a good man, more or less, and he\ntaught me how to kill, into the bargain. I’ve fucked a lot of worse men for a\nlot less.” She frowned at Luthar’s jaw, pressing it with her thumbs, testing\nthe flesh round the wound. “A lot less.”\n“Right,” muttered Logen. He exchanged a worried glance with Luthar.\nThis conversation hadn’t gone at all the way he’d imagined. Maybe he\nshould’ve expected that with Ferro. He spent half the time trying to prise a\nword out of her, then when she did give him something, he didn’t have a\nclue where to go with it.\n“It’s set,” she grunted after probing Luthar’s face for a moment in\nsilence.\n“Thank you.” He grabbed hold of her hand as she moved back. “Truly. I\ndon’t know what I’d have—”\nShe grimaced as if he’d slapped her, and snatched her fingers away.\n“Fine! But if you get your face smashed again, you can stitch it yourself.”\nAnd she got up and stalked off, sat down in the shifting shadows in the\ncorner of the ruin, as far away from the others as she could get without\ngoing outside. She seemed to like thanks even less than she liked any other\nkind of talk, but Luthar was too pleased to finally have the dressings off to\nworry much about it.\n“How does it look?” he asked, peering down cross-eyed at his own chin,\nwincing and prodding at it with one finger.\n“It’s good,” said Logen. “You’re lucky. You might not be quite so pretty\nas you were, but you’re still a damn sight better-looking than me.”\n“Of course,” he said, licking at the notch in his lip, half smiling. “It isn’t\nas though they cut my head right off.”\nLogen grinned as he knelt down beside the pot and gave it a stir. He was\ngetting on alright with Luthar now. It was a harsh lesson, but a broken face\nhad done that boy a power of good. It had taught him some respect, and a\nlot quicker than any amount of talk. It had taught him to be realistic, and\nthat had to be a good thing. Small gestures and time. Rarely failed to win\nfolk over. Then he caught sight of Ferro, frowning at him from the shadows,\nand he felt his grin sag. Some folk take longer than others, and a few never\nreally get there. Black Dow had been like that. Made to walk alone, Logen’s\nfather would have said.\nHe looked back to the pot, but there wasn’t much encouragement in it.\nJust porridge with some shreds of bacon and some chopped-up roots. There\nwas nothing to hunt out here. Dead land meant what it said. The grass on\nthe plain had dwindled to brown tufts and grey dust. He looked round the\nruined shell of the house they’d pitched camp in. Firelight flickered on"

Firelight flickered on\nbroken stone, crumbled render, ancient splintered wood. No ferns rooted in\nthe cracks, no saplings in the earth floor, not even a shred of moss between\nthe stones. Seemed to Logen as if no one but them had trodden there in\ncenturies. Maybe they hadn’t.\nQuiet too. Not much wind tonight. Only the soft crackling of the fire,\nand Bayaz’s voice mumbling away, lecturing his apprentice about\nsomething or other. Logen was good and glad the First of the Magi was\nawake again, even if he did look older and seem grimmer than ever. At least\nnow Logen didn’t have to decide what to do. That had never worked out too\nwell for anyone concerned.\n“A clear night at last!” sang Brother Longfoot as he ducked under the\nlintel, pointing upwards with huge smugness. “A perfect sky for\nNavigation! The stars shine clearly for the first time in ten days and, I do\ndeclare, we are not a stride out from our chosen course! Not a foot! I have\nnot led us wrong, my friends. No! That would not have been my way at all!\nForty miles to Aulcus, as I reckon it, just as I told you!” No congratulations\nwere forthcoming. Bayaz and Quai were deep in their ill-tempered\nmuttering. Luthar was holding up the blade of his short sword and trying to\nfind an angle where he could see his reflection. Ferro was frowning in her\ncorner. Longfoot sighed and squatted down beside the fire. “Porridge\nagain?” he muttered, peering into the pot and wrinkling up his nose.\n“Afraid so.”\n“Ah, well. The tribulations of the road, eh, my friend? There would be\nno glory in travel without the hardship.”\n“Uh,” said Logen. He could have managed with a lot less glory if it\nmeant a decent dinner. He prodded unhappily at the bubbling mush with a\nspoon.\nLongfoot leaned over to mutter under his breath. “It would seem our\nillustrious employer is having some further troubles with his apprentice.”\nBayaz’s lecture was growing steadily louder and more bad-tempered.\n“… being handy with a pan is all very well, but the practice of magic is\nstill your first vocation. There has been a distinct change in your attitude of\nlate. A certain watchfulness and disobedience. I am beginning to suspect\nthat you may prove a disappointing pupil.”\n“And were you always a fine pupil?” There was a trace of a mocking\nsmile on Quai’s face. “Was your own master never disappointed?”\n“He was, and the consequences were dire. We all make mistakes. It is a\nmaster’s place to try to stop his students from making the same ones.”\n“Then perhaps you should tell me the history of your mistakes. I might\nlearn to be a better student.”\nMaster and apprentice glared at each other over the fire. Logen did not\nlike the look of Bayaz’s frown. He had seen such looks before on the First\nof the Magi, and the outcome had never been good. He couldn’t understand"

He couldn’t understand\nwhy Quai had shifted from abject obedience to sullen opposition in the\nspace of a few weeks, but it wasn’t making anyone’s life easier. Logen\npretended to be fascinated by the porridge, half expecting to be suddenly\ndeafened by the roar of searing flame. But when sound came, it was only\nBayaz’s voice, and speaking softly.\n“Very well, Master Quai, there is some sense in your request, for once.\nLet us talk of my mistakes. An expansive subject indeed. Where to start?”\n“At the beginning?” ventured his apprentice. “Where else should a man\never start?”\nThe Magus gave a sour grunt. “Huh. Long ago, then, in the Old Time.”\nHe paused for a moment and stared into the flames, the light shifting over\nhis hollow face. “I was Juvens’ first apprentice. But soon after starting my\neducation, my master took a second. A boy from the South. His name was\nKhalul.” Ferro looked up suddenly, frowning from the shadows. “From the\nbeginning, the two of us could never agree. We both were far too proud, and\njealous of each other’s talents, and envious of any mark of favour the other\nearned from our master. Our rivalry persisted, even as the years passed and\nJuvens took more apprentices, twelve in all. In the beginning, it drove us to\nbe better pupils: more diligent, more devoted. But after the horror of the\nwar with Glustrod, many things were changed.”\nLogen gathered up the bowls and started spooning steaming slop out\ninto them, making sure to keep one ear on Bayaz’s talk. “Our rivalry\nbecame a feud, and our feud became a hatred. We fought, with words, then\nwith hands, then with magic. Perhaps, left to ourselves, we would have\nkilled each other. Perhaps the world would be a happier place if we had, but\nJuvens interposed. He sent me to the far North, and Khalul to the South, to\ntwo of the great libraries he had built long years before. He sent us there to\nstudy, separately and alone, until our tempers cooled. He thought the high\nmountains, and the wide sea, and the whole breadth of the Circle of the\nWorld would put an end to our feud, but he misjudged us. Rather we each\nraged in our exile, and blamed the other for it, and plotted our petty\nrevenges.”\nLogen shared out the food, such as it was, while Bayaz glared at Quai\nfrom under his heavy brows. “If I had only had the good sense to listen to\nmy master then, but I was young, and headstrong, and full of pride. I burned\nto make myself more powerful than Khalul. I decided, fool that I was, that\nif Juvens would not teach me… I had to find another master.”\n“Slop again, eh, pink?” grunted Ferro as she pulled her bowl from\nLogen’s hand.\n“No need to thank me.” He tossed her a spoon and she snatched it out of\nthe air. Logen handed the First of the Magi his bowl. “Another master?"

Logen handed the First of the Magi his bowl. “Another master?\nWhat other master could you find?”\n“Only one,” murmured Bayaz. “Kanedias. The Master Maker.” He\nturned his spoon over and over thoughtfully in his hand. “I went to his\nHouse, and I knelt before him, and I begged to learn at his feet. He refused\nme, of course, as he refused everyone… at first. But I was stubborn, and in\ntime he relented, and agreed to teach me.”\n“And so you lived in the House of the Maker,” murmured Quai. Logen\nshivered as he hunched down over his own bowl. His one brief visit to the\nplace still gave him nightmares.\n“I did,” said Bayaz, “and I learned its ways. My skill in High Art made\nme useful to my new master. But Kanedias was far more jealous of his\nsecrets than ever Juvens had been, and he worked me as hard as a slave at\nhis forges, and taught me only such scraps as I needed to serve him. I grew\nbitter, and when the Maker left to seek out materials for his works, my\ncuriosity, and my ambition, and my thirst for knowledge, drove me to stray\ninto parts of his House where he had forbidden me to tread. And there I\nfound his best-guarded secret.” He paused.\n“What was it?” prompted Longfoot, spoon frozen halfway to his mouth.\n“His daughter.”\n“Tolomei,” whispered Quai, in a hiss barely audible.\nBayaz nodded, and one corner of his mouth curled upwards, as though\nhe remembered something good. “She was unlike any other. She had never\nleft the Maker’s House, had never spoken to anyone besides her father. She\nhelped him with certain tasks, I learned. She handled… certain materials…\nthat only the Maker’s own blood could touch. That, I believe, is why he\nfathered her in the first place. She was beautiful beyond compare.” Bayaz’s\nface twitched, and he looked down at the ground with a sour smile. “Or so\nshe seems to me, in memory.”\n“That was good,” said Luthar, licking his fingers and setting down his\nempty bowl. He’d become a great deal less picky with his food lately.\nLogen reckoned a few weeks of not being able to chew was sure to do that\nto a man. “There any more?” he asked hopefully.\n“Take mine,” hissed Quai, thrusting his bowl at Luthar. His face was\ndeathly cold, his eyes two points of light in the shadows as he glared across\nat his master. “Go on.”\nBayaz looked up. “Tolomei fascinated me, and I her. It seems strange to\nsay, but I was young then, and full of fire, and still had as fine a head of hair\nas Captain Luthar.” He ran one hissing palm over his bald scalp, then\nshrugged his shoulders. “We fell in love.” He looked at each of them in\nturn, as though daring them to laugh, but Logen was too busy sucking salty\nporridge from his teeth, and no one else so much as smiled."

He had gathered from far and wide some fragments of material\nfrom the world below, left over from the time when demons still walked our\nearth. He was trying to tap the power of these splinters, to incorporate them\ninto his machines. He was tampering with those forces forbidden by the\nFirst Law, and had already had some success.” Logen shifted\nuncomfortably. He remembered the thing he had seen in the Maker’s\nHouse, lying in the wet on a block of white stone, strange and fascinating.\nThe Divider, Bayaz had called it. Two edges—one here, one on the Other\nSide. He had no appetite now, and he shoved his bowl down by the fire,\nhalf-finished.\n“I was horrified,” continued Bayaz. “I had seen the ruin that Glustrod\nhad brought upon the world, and I resolved to go to Juvens and tell him\neverything. But I feared to leave Tolomei behind, and she would not leave\nall she knew. So I delayed, and Kanedias returned unexpected, and found us\ntogether. His fury was”—Bayaz winced as though the memory alone was\npainful—“impossible to describe. His House shook with it, rang with it,\nburned with it. I was lucky to escape with my life, and fled to seek\nsanctuary with my old master.”\nFerro snorted. “He was the forgiving type, then?”\n“Fortunately for me. Juvens would not turn me away, despite my\nbetrayal. Especially once I told him of his brother’s attempts to break the\nFirst Law. The Maker came in great wrath, demanding justice for the\nviolation of his daughter, the theft of his secrets. Juvens refused. He\ndemanded to know what experiments Kanedias had been undertaking. The\nbrothers fought, and I fled. The sky was lit with the fury of their battle. I\nreturned to find my master dead, his brother gone. I swore vengeance. I\ngathered the Magi from across the world, and we made war on the Maker.\nAll of us. Except for Khalul.”\n“Why not him?” growled Ferro.\n“He said that I could not be trusted. That my folly had caused the war.”\n“All too true, surely?” muttered Quai.\n“Perhaps, in part. But he made far worse accusations also. He and his\ncursed apprentice, Mamun. Lies,” he hissed at the fire. “All lies, and the rest\nof the Magi were not deceived. So Khalul left the order, and returned to the\nSouth, and sought for power elsewhere. And he found it. By doing as\nGlustrod had done, and damning himself. By breaking the Second Law, and\neating the flesh of men. Only eleven of us went to fight Kanedias, and only\nnine of us returned.”\nBayaz took a long breath, and gave a long sigh. “So, Master Quai. There\nis the story of my mistakes, laid bare. You could say they were the cause of\nmy master’s death, of the schism in the order of Magi. You could say that is"

You could say that is\nwhy we are now heading westwards, into the ruins of the past. You could\nsay that is why Captain Luthar has suffered a broken jaw.”\n“The seeds of the past bear fruit in the present,” muttered Logen to\nhimself.\n“So they do,” said Bayaz, “so they do. And sour fruit indeed. Will you\nlearn from my mistakes, Master Quai, as I have, and pay some attention to\nyour master?”\n“Of course,” said the apprentice, though Logen wondered if there was a\nhint of irony in his voice. “I will obey in all things.”\n“You would be wise to. If I had obeyed Juvens, perhaps I would not\nhave this.” Bayaz undid the top two buttons of his shirt and pulled his collar\nto one side. The firelight flickered on a faded scar, from the base of the old\nman’s neck down towards his shoulder. “The Maker himself gave it to me.\nAnother inch and it would have been my death.” He rubbed sourly at it.\n“All those years ago, and it still aches, from time to time. The pain it has\ngiven me over the slow years… so you see, Master Luthar, although you\nbear a mark, it could be worse.”\nLongfoot cleared his throat. “That is quite an injury, of course, but I\nbelieve I can do better.” He took hold of his dirty trouser leg and pulled it\nright up to his groin, turning his sinewy thigh towards the firelight. There\nwas an ugly mass of puckered grey scar flesh almost all the way round his\nleg. Even Logen had to admit to being impressed.\n“What the hell did that?” asked Luthar, looking slightly queasy.\nLongfoot smiled. “Many years ago, when I was yet a young man, I was\nshipwrecked in a storm off the coast of Suljuk. Nine times, in all, God has\nseen fit to dump me into his cold ocean in bad weather. Luckily, I have\nalways been truly blessed as a swimmer. Unluckily, on this occasion, some\nmanner of great fish took me for its next meal.”\n“A fish?” muttered Ferro.\n“Indeed. A most huge and aggressive fish, with a jaw wide as a doorway\nand teeth like knives. Fortunately, a sharp blow on the nose”—and he\nchopped at the air with his hand—“caused it to release me, and a fortuitous\ncurrent washed me up on shore. I was doubly blessed to find a sympathetic\nlady among the natives who allowed me to recuperate in her abode, for the\npeople of Suljuk are generally most suspicious of outsiders.” He sighed\nhappily. “That is how I came to learn their language. A highly spiritual\npeople. God has favoured me. Truly.” There was a silence.\n“I bet you can do better.” Luthar was grinning across at Logen.\n“I got bitten by a mean sheep once, but it didn’t leave much of a mark.”\n“What about the finger?”\n“This?” He stared at the familiar stub, waggling it back and forward.\n“What about it?”\n“How did you lose it?”"

He wasn’t sure he liked the way this conversation was\ngoing. Hearing about Bayaz’s mistakes was one thing, but he wasn’t that\nkeen to delve into his own. The dead knew, he’d made some bad ones. Still,\nthey were all looking now. He had to say something. “I lost it in a battle.\nOutside a place called Carleon. I was young back then, and full of fire\nmyself. It was my stupid fashion to go charging into the thick of the\nfighting. That time, when I came out, the finger was gone.”\n“Heat of the moment, eh?” asked Bayaz.\n“Something like that.” He frowned and rubbed gently at the stump.\n“Strange thing. For a long time after it was gone, I could still feel it, itching,\nright in the tip. Drove me mad. How can you scratch a finger that’s not\nthere?”\n“Did it hurt?” asked Luthar.\n“Like a bastard, to begin with, but not half as much as some others I’ve\nhad.”\n“Like what?”\nThat needed some thinking about. Logen scratched at his face and\nturned over all the hours, and days, and weeks he’d spent injured, and\nbloody, and screaming. Limping around or trying to cut his meat with his\nhands all bandaged up. “I got a good sword cut across my face one time,”\nhe said, feeling the notch Tul Duru had made in his ear. “Bled like anything.\nNearly got my eye poked out with an arrow,” he added, rubbing at the\ncrescent scar under his brow. “Took hours to dig out all the splinters. Then I\nhad a bloody great rock dropped on me at the siege of Uffrith. First day, as\nwell.” He rubbed the back of his head and felt the lumpy ridges, under his\nhair. “Broke my skull, and my shoulder too.”\n“Nasty,” said Bayaz.\n“My own fault. That’s what you get when you try and tear a city wall\ndown with your bare hands.” Luthar stared at him, and he shrugged. “Didn’t\nwork. Like I said, I was hot-headed in my youth.”\n“I’m only surprised you didn’t try and chew through it.”\n“Most likely that would’ve been my next move. Just as well they\ndropped a rock on me. At least I’ve still got my teeth. Spent two months\nsquealing on my back while they laid siege to the city. I only just healed in\ntime for the fight with Threetrees, when I got the whole lot broken again,\nand more besides.” Logen winced at the memory, curling up the fingers of\nhis right hand and straightening them out, remembering the pain of it, all\nsmashed up. “Now, that really did hurt. Not as much as this, though,” and\nhe dug his hand under his belt and pulled his shirt up. They all peered\nacross the fire to see what he was pointing at. A small scar, really, just under\nhis bottom rib, in the hollow beside his stomach.\n“Doesn’t look like much,” said Luthar."

There was a long silence while they took that in.\n“Right through?” murmured Longfoot.\n“Right through, with a spear. In a duel, with a man called Harding Grim.\nDamn lucky to live, and that’s a fact.”\n“If it was in a duel,” murmured Bayaz, “how did you come out alive?”\nLogen licked his lips. His mouth tasted bitter. “I beat him.”\n“With a spear through you?”\n“I didn’t know about it until afterwards.”\nLongfoot and Luthar frowned at each other. “That would seem a difficult\ndetail to overlook,” said the Navigator.\n“You’d think so.” Logen hesitated, trying to think of a good way to put\nit, but there was no good way. “There are times… well… I don’t really\nknow what I’m doing.”\nA long pause. “How do you mean?” asked Bayaz, and Logen winced.\nAll the fragile trust he’d built over the last few weeks was in danger of\ncrumbling round his ears, but he didn’t see any choice. He’d never been\nmuch of a liar.\n“When I was fourteen, I think, I argued with a friend. Can’t even\nremember what about. I remember being angry. I remember he hit me. Then\nI was looking at my hands.” And he looked down at them now, pale in the\ndarkness. “I’d strangled him. Good and dead. I didn’t remember doing it,\nbut there was only me there, and I had his blood under my nails. I dragged\nhim up some rocks, and I threw him off onto his head, and I said he fell out\nof a tree and died, and everyone believed me. His mother cried, and so on,\nbut what could I do? That was the first time it happened.”\nLogen felt the eyes of the group all fixed on him. “Few years later I\nnearly killed my father. Stabbed him while we were eating. Don’t know\nwhy. Don’t know why at all. He healed, luckily.”\nHe felt Longfoot easing nervously away, and he hardly blamed him.\n“That was when the Shanka started coming more often. So my father sent\nme south, over the mountains, to look for help. So I found Bethod, and he\noffered me help if I’d fight for him. I was happy to do it, fool that I was, but\nthe fighting went on, and on. The things I did in those wars… the things\nthey told me I did.” He took a long breath. “Well, I’d killed friends. You\nshould have seen what I did to enemies. To begin with, I enjoyed it. I loved\nto sit at the top of the fire, to look at men and see their fear, to have no man\ndare to meet my eye, but it got worse. And worse. There came one winter\nthat I didn’t know who I was, or what I was doing most of the time."

The ruined building had been\nseeming like some kind of comfort after all that dead and empty space on\nthe plain, but it didn’t any more. The empty windows yawned like wounds.\nThe empty doorways gaped like graves. The silence dragged on, and on,\nand then Longfoot cleared his throat. “So, for the sake of argument, do you\nthink it’s possible that, perhaps without intending to, you might kill one of\nus?”\n“It’s more likely I’d kill all of you than one.”\nBayaz was frowning. “Forgive me if I feel less than entirely reassured.”\n“I wish at least that you had mentioned this earlier!” snapped Longfoot.\n“It is the type of information a travelling companion should share! I hardly\nthink that—”\n“Leave him be,” growled Ferro.\n“But we need to know—”\n“Shut your mouth, stargazing fool. You’re all a long way from perfect.”\nShe scowled over at Longfoot. “Some of you make a lot of words and are\nnowhere near when the trouble starts.” She frowned at Luthar. “Some of\nyou are a lot less use than you think you are.” She glared at Bayaz. “And\nsome of you keep a lot of secrets, then fall asleep at bad times and leave the\nrest of us stranded in the middle of nowhere. So he’s a killer. So fucking\nwhat? Suited you well enough when the killing needed doing.”\n“I only wanted to—”\n“Shut your mouth, I said.” Longfoot blinked for a moment, then did as\nhe was told.\nLogen stared across the fire at Ferro. The very last place he’d ever have\nhoped to get a good word. Out of all of them, only she’d seen it happen.\nOnly she knew what he really meant. And still she’d spoken up for him. She\nsaw him looking, and she scowled and shrank back into her corner, but that\ndidn’t change anything. He felt himself smile.\n“What about you, then?” Bayaz was looking at Ferro as well, touching\none finger to his lip as though thinking.\n“What about me?”\n“You say you don’t like secrets. We have all spoken of our scars. I bored\nthe group with my old stories, and the Bloody-Nine thrilled us with his.”\nThe Magus tapped his bony face, full of hard shadows from the fire. “How\ndid you get yours?”\nA pause. “I bet you made whoever gave you that suffer, eh?” said\nLuthar, a trace of laughter in his voice.\nLongfoot started to chuckle. “Oh indeed! I daresay he came to a sharp\nend! I dread to think of the—”\n“I did it,” said Ferro.\nSuch laughter as there was sputtered and died, the smiles faded as they\ntook that in. “Eh?” said Logen."

I dread to think of the—”\n“I did it,” said Ferro.\nSuch laughter as there was sputtered and died, the smiles faded as they\ntook that in. “Eh?” said Logen.\n“What, pink, you fucking deaf? I did it to myself.”\n“Why?”\n“Hah!” she barked, glaring at him across the fire. “You don’t know what\nit is to be owned! When I was twelve years old, I was sold to a man called\nSusman.” And she spat on the ground and snarled something in her own\ntongue. Logen didn’t reckon it was a compliment. “He owned a place where\ngirls were trained, then sold on at a profit.”\n“Trained to do what?” asked Luthar.\n“What do you think, fool? To fuck.”\n“Ah,” he squeaked, swallowing and looking at the ground again.\n“Two years I was there. Two years, before I stole a knife. I did not know\nthen how to kill. So I hurt my owner the best way I could. I cut myself,\nright to the bone. By the time they got the blade away from me I had cut my\nprice down to a quarter.” She grinned fiercely at the fire as if it had been her\nproudest day. “You should have heard him squeal, the bastard!”\nLogen stared. Longfoot gaped. Even the First of the Magi looked\nshocked. “You scarred yourself?”\n“What of it?” Silence again. The wind blew up and swirled around\ninside the ruin, hissing in the chinks between the stones and making the\nflames flicker and dance. No one had much left to say after that.\nFurious\nT\nhe snow drifted down, white specks swirling in the empty air beyond the\ncliff’s edge, turning the green pines, the black rocks, the brown river below\ninto grey ghosts.\nWest could hardly believe that as a child he had looked forward to the\ncoming of snow every year. That he had been delighted to wake up and see\nthe world coated in white. That it could have held a mystery, and a wonder,\nand a joy. Now the sight of the flakes settling on Cathil’s hair, on Ladisla’s\ncoat, on West’s own filthy trouser leg, filled him with horror. More gripping\ncold, more chafing wet, more crushing effort to move. He rubbed his pale\nhands together, sniffed, and frowned up at the sky, willing himself not to\nslide into misery.\n“Have to make the best of things,” he whispered, the words croaking in\nhis raw throat and smoking thick in the cold. “Have to.” He thought of\nwarm summer in the Agriont. Blossoms blowing from the trees in the\nsquares. Birds twittering on the shoulders of smiling statues. Sunlight\npouring through leafy branches in the park. It did not help. He sniffed back\nrunny snot, tried yet again to worm his hands up into his uniform sleeves,\nbut they were never quite long enough. He gripped the frayed hems with his\npale fingers. Would he ever be warm again?\nHe felt Pike’s hand on his shoulder. “Something’s up,” murmured the\nconvict. He pointed at the Northmen, squatting in a group, muttering\nurgently to each other."

He pointed at the Northmen, squatting in a group, muttering\nurgently to each other.\nWest stared wearily over at them. He had only just got nearly\ncomfortable and it was difficult to take an interest in anything beyond his\nown pain. He slowly unfolded his aching legs, heard his cold knees click as\nhe got up, shook himself, tried to slap the tiredness out of his body. He\nstarted shuffling towards the Northmen, bent over like an old man, arms\nwrapped round himself for warmth. Before he got there, the meeting had\nalready broken up. Another decision made without any need for his opinion.\nThreetrees strode towards him, utterly unaffected by the falling snow.\n“The Dogman’s spotted some of Bethod’s scouts,” he grunted, pointing\nthrough the trees. “Just down the rise there, right in by the stream, near\nthose falls. Lucky he caught them. They could just as easily have caught us,\nand we’d most likely all be dead by now.”\n“How many?”\n“A dozen, he thinks. Getting round ’em could be risky.”\nWest frowned, rocking his weight from one foot back to the other, trying\nto keep the blood moving. “Surely fighting them would be riskier still?”\n“Maybe, maybe not. If we can get the jump on ’em, our chances ain’t\nbad. They’ve got food, weapons,” he looked West up and down, “and\nclothes. All kinds o’ gear that we could use. We’re just past the knuckle o’\nwinter now. We keep heading north, it ain’t going to get any warmer. It’s\ndecided. We’re fighting. A dozen’s long odds, so we’ll need every man.\nYour mate Pike there looks like he can swing an axe without worrying too\nmuch on the results. You’d best get him ready an’ all.” He nodded at\nLadisla, hunched up on the ground. “The girl should stay out, but—”\n“Not the Prince. It’s too dangerous.”\nThreetrees narrowed his eyes. “You’re damn right it’s dangerous. That’s\nwhy every man should share the risk.”\nWest leaned in close, doing his best to sound persuasive with his cracked\nlips as tough and thick as a pair of overcooked sausages. “He’d only make\nthe risk greater for everyone. We both know it.” The Prince peered back at\nthem suspiciously, trying to guess what they were talking about. “He’d be\nabout as much use in a fight as a sack over your head.”\nThe old Northman snorted. “Most likely you’re right there.” He took a\ndeep breath and frowned, taking some time to think about it. “Alright. It\nain’t usual, but alright. He stays, him and the girl. The rest of us fight, and\nthat means you too.”\nWest nodded. Each man has to do his part, however little he might relish\nthe prospect. “Fair enough. The rest of us fight.” And he stumbled back over\nto tell the others.\nBack home in the bright gardens of the Agriont, Crown Prince Ladisla\nwould never have been recognised. The dandies, the courtiers, the hangers-\non who usually clung to his every word would most likely have stepped"

The coat West had given him was coming\napart at the seams, worn through at the elbows, crusted with mud. Beneath\nit, his spotless white uniform had gradually darkened to the colour of filth.\nA few tatters of gold braid still hung from it, like a glorious bouquet of\nflowers rotted down to the greasy stalks. His hair was a tangled thatch, he\nhad developed a patchy growth of ginger beard, and a rash of hair between\nhis brows implied that in happier days he had spent a great deal of time\nplucking them. The only man within a hundred miles in a sorrier condition\nwas probably West himself.\n“What’s to do?” mumbled the Prince as West dropped down beside him.\n“There are some of Bethod’s scouts down near the river, Your Highness.\nWe have to fight.”\nThe Prince nodded. “I will need a weapon of some—”\n“I must ask you to stay behind.”\n“Colonel West, I feel that I should be—”\n“You would be a great asset, Your Highness, but I am afraid it is quite\nout of the question. You are the heir to the throne. We cannot afford to put\nyou in harm’s way.”\nLadisla did his best to look disappointed, but West could almost taste his\nrelief. “Very well, if you’re sure.”\n“Absolutely.” West looked at Cathil. “The two of you should stay here.\nWe’ll be back soon. With luck.” He almost winced at the last part. Luck had\nbeen decidedly thin on the ground lately. “Keep out of sight, and keep\nquiet.”\nShe grinned back at him. “Don’t worry. I’ll make sure he doesn’t hurt\nhimself.”\nLadisla glowered sideways, fists clenched with impotent anger. It\nseemed he was getting no better at dealing with her constant jibes. No doubt\nbeing flattered and obeyed your entire life was poor preparation for being\nmade a fool of in awful conditions. West wondered for a moment if he was\nmaking a mistake leaving them alone, but it was hardly as though he had\nany choice. They were well out of the way up here. They should be safe. A\nlot safer than him, anyway.\nThey squatted down on their haunches. A ring of scarred and dirty faces,\nhard expressions, ragged hair. Threetrees, his craggy features creased with\ndeep lines. Black Dow with his missing ear and his savage grin. Tul Duru,\nhis heavy brows drawn in. Grim, looking as careless as a stone. The\nDogman, bright eyes narrowed, breath steaming from his sharp nose. Pike,\nwith a deep frown across those few parts of his burned face that were\ncapable of movement. Six of the hardest-looking men in the world, and\nWest.\nHe swallowed. Every man has to do his part.\nThreetrees was scratching a crude map in the hard soil with a stick.\n“Alright, lads, they’re tucked in down here near the river, a dozen, maybe\nmore. Here’s how we’ll get it done. Grim, up on the left, Dogman on the\nright, usual drill.”"

Grim, up on the left, Dogman on the\nright, usual drill.”\n“Done, chief,” said the Dogman. Grim nodded.\n“Me, Tul, and Pike’ll come at ’em from this side, hand to hand. Hope to\nsurprise ’em. Don’t shoot any of us, eh, lads?”\nThe Dogman grinned. “If you keep well clear of the arrows, you’ll be\nfine.”\n“I’ll keep that in mind. Dow and West, you’ll get across the river and\nwait by the falls there. Come up behind them.” The stick scratched a hard\ngroove into the earth, and West felt the lump of worry swelling in his throat.\n“Noise of the water should keep you out of notice. Go when you see me\nchuck a stone over into the pool, you hear me? The stone coming over.\nThat’s the signal.”\n“’Course it is, chief,” grunted Dow.\nWest suddenly realised that Threetrees was glaring right at him. “You\nhearing this, boy?”\n“Er, yes, of course,” he muttered, tongue clumsy with cold and growing\nfear. “When the stone comes over, we go… chief.”\n“Alright. And the lot of you keep your eyes open. There could be others\nnear. Bethod’s got scouts all over the country. Anyone still guessing at what\nto do?” They all shook their heads. “Good. Then don’t go blaming me if\nyou get yourself killed.”\nThreetrees stood up and the others followed him. They made their last\nfew preparations, loosening blades in sheaths, pulling at bowstrings,\ntightening buckles. There wasn’t much for West to prepare. A heavy, stolen\nsword pushed through a weathered belt, and that was it. He felt an utter fool\nin amongst this company. He wondered how many people they had killed\nbetween them. He would not have been surprised if it had been a whole\ntown full, with enough left over for an outlying village or two. Even Pike\nlooked more than ready to commit careless murder. West had to remind\nhimself that he had not the slightest idea why the man had been convicted\nto a penal colony in the first place. Looking at him now, running a\nthoughtful thumb down the edge of his heavy axe, eyes hard in that dead,\nburned face, it was not difficult to imagine.\nWest stared at his hands. They were trembling, and not just from the\ncold. He grabbed one with the other and squeezed them tight. He looked up\nto see the Dogman grinning at him. “Got to have fear to have courage,” he\nsaid, then turned and followed Threetrees and the others into the trees.\nBlack Dow’s harsh voice hacked at West from behind. “You’re with me,\nkiller. Try and keep up.” He spat on the frozen ground then turned and set\noff towards the river. West took one last look back towards the others.\nCathil nodded to him, once, and he nodded back, then he turned and\nfollowed Dow, ducking through the trees in silence, all coated with\nglittering, dripping ice, while the hissing of the waterfall grew louder and\nlouder in his ears."

He could see the falls just upstream, a wall of dark rock and rushing\nwhite water between the black tree trunks, throwing freezing mist and noise\ninto the air.\nThe river here was no more than four strides across, but the water\nflooded past, quick and dark, frothing round the wet stones at its edges.\nDow held his sword and axe up high, waded out steadily, up to his waist in\nthe middle, then crept up onto the far bank, pressing himself dripping\nagainst the rocks. He looked round, frowned to see West so far behind,\njerked his hand angrily for him to follow.\nWest fumbled out his own sword and lifted it up, held a deep breath, and\nstepped into the stream. The water flooded into his boot and round his calf.\nIt felt as if his leg had been suddenly clamped in ice. He took a step forward\nand his other leg vanished up to the thigh. His eyes bulged, his breath came\nin snorts, but there could be no turning back. He took one more step. His\nboot slipped on the mossy stones on the bed of the stream and he slid\nhelplessly in up to his armpits. He would have screamed if the freezing\nwater had not hammered the air out of his lungs. He floundered forward,\nhalf stumbling, half swimming, teeth gritted with panic, sloshed up onto the\nfar bank, breath hissing in shallow, desperate gasps. He staggered up and\nleaned against the stones behind Dow, his skin numb and prickling.\nThe Northman smirked at him. “You look cold, boy.”\n“I’m fine,” spluttered West through chattering teeth. He had never been\nso cold in his life. “I’ll do my puh… puh… part.”\n“You’ll do your what? I’ll not have you fighting cold, boy, you’ll get us\nboth killed.”\n“Don’t worry about—” Dow’s open hand slapped him hard across the\nface. The shock of it was almost worse than the pain. West gawped,\ndropping his blade in the mud, one hand jerking up instinctively to his\nstinging cheek. “What the—”\n“Use it!” hissed the Northman at him. “It belongs to you!”\nWest was just opening his mouth when Dow’s other hand smacked into\nit and sent him staggering against the rocks, blood dribbling from his lip\nand onto the wet earth, his head singing.\n“It’s yours.

Own it!”\n“You fucking…” The rest was nothing more than a mindless growl as\nWest’s hands closed round Dow’s neck, squeezing, clawing, snarling like an\nanimal, teeth bared and mindless. The blood surged round his body, the\nhunger, and the pain, and the frustration of the endless freezing march\nspilling out of him all at once.\nBut Black Dow was twice as strong as West, however angry he was.\n“Use it!” he growled as he peeled West’s hands away and crushed him back\nagainst the rocks. “You hot yet?”\nSomething flashed overhead and splashed into the water beside them.\nDow gave him a parting shove, then sprang away, charging up the bank\nwith a roar. West struggled after him, clawing the heavy sword up out of the\nmud and lifting it high, the blood pulsing in his head, howling meaningless\nsounds at the top of his lungs.\nThe muddy ground sped by underneath him. He crashed through bushes\nand rotten wood into the open. He saw Dow hack a gawping Northman\ndown with his axe. Dark blood leapt into the air, black spots against the\ntangle of branches and white sky. Trees and rocks and shaggy men jolted\nand wobbled, his own breath roaring in his ears like a storm. Someone\nloomed up and he swung the sword at them, felt it bite. Blood spattered into\nWest’s face and he reeled, and spat, and blinked, slid onto his side, and\nscrambled up. His head was full of wailing and crying, clashing metal and\ncracking bone.\nChop. Hack. Snarl.\nSomeone staggered near him, clutching at an arrow in his chest. West’s\nsword split his skull open down to his mouth. The corpse jerked, twisting\nthe blade from his hand. He stumbled in the dirt, half fell, lashed out at a\npassing body with his fist. Something crashed into him and flung him back\nagainst a tree, knocking the air from his lungs in a breathy wheeze.\nSomeone had him fast around the chest, pinning his arms, trying to crush\nthe life out of him.\nWest craned forward, and sank his teeth into the man’s lip, felt them\nmeet in the middle. He screamed and punched, but West hardly felt the\nblows. He spat out the flap of flesh and butted him in the face. The man\nsquirmed and yelped, blood leaking out of his torn mouth. West clamped his\nteeth round his nose, growling like a mad dog.\nBite. Bite. Bite.\nHis mouth filled with blood. He could hear screaming in his ears, but all\nthat mattered was to squeeze his jaws together, tighter and tighter. He\ntwisted his head away and the man reeled back, clutching at his face. An\narrow came out of nowhere and thudded into his ribs, he fell to his knees.\nWest dived on him, grabbed hold of his tangled hair with clutching hands,\nand smashed his face into the ground, again and again.\n“It’s done.”\nWest’s hands jerked back, grasping claws full of blood and ripped-out\nhair. He struggled up, gasping, eyes bulging."

He struggled up, gasping, eyes bulging.\nEverything was still. The world had stopped reeling. Spots of snow\nfiltered gently down into the clearing, settling across the wet earth, the\nscattered gear, the stretched-out bodies, and the men still standing. Tul was\nnot far away, staring at him. Threetrees was behind, sword in hand. Pike’s\npink slab of a face had something close to a wince on it, one bloody fist\nsqueezed round his arm. They were all looking. All looking at him. Dow\nraised his hand, pointing at West. He tipped his head back and started to\nlaugh. “You bit him! You bit his fucking nose off! I knew you were a mad\nbastard!”\nWest stared at them. The thumping in his head was starting to subside.\n“What?” he muttered. There was blood all over him. He wiped his mouth.\nSalty. He looked at the nearest corpse, facedown on the earth. Blood was\ntrickling from underneath its head, running down the slope and pooling\naround West’s boot. He remembered… something. A sudden cramp in his\nguts bent him over, spitting pink onto the ground, empty stomach heaving.\n“Furious!” shouted Dow. “That’s what y’are!”\nGrim had already stepped out of the bushes, bow over his shoulder, and\nwas squatting down, dragging a bloody fur from one of the corpses. “Good\ncoat,” he muttered to himself.\nWest watched them all pick over the campsite, bent over and sick and\nutterly spent. He listened to Dow laughing. “Furious!” cackled his harsh\nvoice. “That’s what I’ll call you!”\n“They got arrows over here.” The Dogman pulled something out of one\nof the packs on the ground, and grinned. “And cheese. Bit dusty.” He\npicked some mould off the wedge of yellow with his dirty fingers, bit into\nit, and grinned. “Still good, though.”\n“Lots o’ good stuff,” nodded Threetrees, starting to smile himself. “And\nwe’re all still going, more or less. Good day’s work, lads.” He slapped Tul\non the back. “We’d best head on north quick before these lot are missed.\nLet’s get what there is fast and pick up those other two.”\nWest’s mind was only just starting to move again. “The others!”\n“Alright,” said Threetrees, “you and Dow check on them… Furious.” He\nturned away with half a smile.\nWest lurched off through the trees the way he’d come, slipping and\nsliding in his haste, blood pulsing again. “Protect the Prince,” he muttered\nto himself. He waded across the stream almost without noticing the cold,\nstruggled onto the far bank and back uphill, hurrying towards the cliff\nwhere they had left the others.\nHe heard a woman’s scream, quickly cut off, a man’s voice growling.\nHorror crept through every part of his body.

The air burned\nin his throat, but he forced himself on, fingers clutching at the tree trunks,\nscrabbling at the loose twigs and needles on the frosty ground.\nHe burst out into the open space beside the cliff, breathing hard, the\nbloody sword gripped tight in his fist.\nTwo figures struggled on the ground. Cathil was underneath, wriggling\non her back, kicking and clawing at someone on top of her. The man had\nmanaged to drag her trousers down below her knees and now he was\nfiddling with his own belt while he struggled to hold his other hand across\nher mouth. West took a step forward, raising the sword high, and the man’s\nhead snapped round. West blinked. The would-be rapist was none other than\nCrown Prince Ladisla himself.\nWhen he saw West, he stumbled up and took a step back. He had a\nslightly sheepish expression, almost a grin, like a schoolboy caught stealing\na pie from the kitchen. “Sorry,” he said, “I thought you’d be longer.”\nWest stared at him, hardly able to understand what was happening.\n“Longer?”\n“You fucking bastard!” screamed Cathil, scrambling back and dragging\nher trousers up. “I’ll fucking kill you!”\nLadisla touched his lip. “She bit me! Look!” He held his bloody\nfingertips out as though they were proof of an outrage perpetrated against\nhim. West found himself moving forward. The Prince must have seen\nsomething in his face, because he took a step away, holding up one hand\nwhile he held up his trousers with the other. “Now, hold on, West, just—”\nThere was no towering rage. No temporary blindness, no limbs moving\nby themselves, not the slightest trace of a headache. There was no anger at\nall. West had never in his life felt so calm, so sober, so sure of himself. He\nchose to do it.\nHis right arm jerked out and his open palm thumped against Ladisla’s\nchest. The Crown Prince gave a gentle gasp as he stumbled sharply\nbackwards. His left foot twisted in the mud. He put down his right foot, but\nthere was no ground behind him. His brows went up, his mouth and eyes\nopened with silent shock. The heir to the throne of the Union fell away from\nWest, his hands clutching vainly, turning slowly to his side in the air… and\nhe was gone.\nThere was a short, breathy cry, a thumping sound, and another, a long\nclattering of stones.\nThen silence.\nWest stood there, blinking.\nHe turned to look at Cathil.\nShe was frozen, a couple of strides away, eyes gawping wide open.\n“You… you…”\n“I know.” It hardly sounded like his voice. He edged to the very brink of\nthe cliff, and peered over. Ladisla’s corpse lay drooped facedown over the\nrocks far below, West’s ragged coat spread out behind him, trousers round\nhis ankles, one knee bent back the wrong way, a ring of dark blood\nspreading out across the stones around his broken head. Never had anyone\nlooked more dead."

He had done that. Him. He had killed the heir to the\nthrone. He had murdered him in cold blood. He was a criminal. He was a\ntraitor. He was a monster.\nAnd he almost wanted to laugh. The sunny Agriont, where loyalty and\ndeference were given without question, where commoners did what their\nbetters told them, where the killing of other people was simply not the done\nthing, all this was very far away. Monster he might be, but out here in the\nfrozen wilderness of Angland, the rules were different. Monsters were in the\nmajority.\nHe felt a hand clap him heavily on the shoulder. He looked up to see\nBlack Dow’s earless head beside him, peering down. The Northman\nwhistled softly through pursed lips. “Well, that’s the end of that, I reckon.\nYou know what, Furious?” And he grinned sideways at West. “I’m getting\nto like you, boy.”\nTo the Last Man\nTo Sand dan Glokta, Superior of Dagoska, and for his eyes alone.\nIt is clear that, in spite of your efforts, Dagoska cannot remain in\nUnion hands for much longer. I therefore order you to leave\nimmediately and present yourself to me. The docks may have been\nlost, but you should have no trouble slipping away by night in a small\nboat. A ship will be waiting for you down the coast.\nYou will confer overall command on General Vissbruck, as the\nonly Union member of Dagoska’s ruling council left alive in the city.\nIt need hardly be said that the orders of the Closed Council to the\ndefenders of Dagoska remain the same.\nTo fight to the last man.\nSult\nArch Lector of His Majesty’s Inquisition.\nG\neneral Vissbruck slowly lowered the letter, his jaws locked tight\ntogether. “Are we to understand, then, Superior, that you are leaving us?”\nHis voice was cracking slightly. With panic? With fear? With anger? Who\ncould blame him, for any one of them?\nThe room was much the same as it had been the first day Glokta arrived\nin the city. The superb mosaics, the masterful carvings, the polished table,\nall shining in the early morning sun streaming through the tall windows.\nThe ruling council itself, however, is sadly reduced. Vissbruck, his jowls\nbulging over the stiff collar of his embroidered jacket, and Haddish Kahdia,\nslumped tiredly in his chair, were all that remained. Nicomo Cosca stood\napart, leaning against the wall near the window and picking his fingernails.\nGlokta took a deep breath. “The Arch Lector wants me to… explain\nmyself.”\nVissbruck gave a squeaky chuckle. “For some reason, the image of rats\nfleeing a burning house springs to mind.” An apt metaphor.

That’s\nwhat I’d have done.”\n“Allow me to have scant regard for what you might have done,” sneered\nVissbruck. “Our situation is critical.

Shortly thereafter, one\nimagines, the Upper City will come under sustained fire from incendiaries!”\nHe stabbed an arm at the window. “They might even reach the Citadel from\nthere! This very room may sport a boulder the size of a woodshed as a\ncentrepiece!”\n“I am well aware of our position,” snapped Glokta. The stench of panic\nthe last few days has grown strong enough almost for the dead to smell it.\n“But the Arch Lector’s orders are most specific. To fight to the last man. No\nsurrender.”\nVissbruck’s shoulders slumped. “Surrender would do no good in any\ncase.” He got up, made a halfhearted attempt to straighten his uniform, then\nslowly pushed his chair under the table. Glokta almost pitied him at that\nmoment. Probably he is deserving of pity, but I wasted all I had on Carlot\ndan Eider, who hardly deserved it at all.\n“Allow me to offer you one piece of advice, from a man who’s seen the\ninside of a Gurkish prison. If the city should fall, I strongly recommend that\nyou take your own life rather than be captured.”\nGeneral Vissbruck’s eyes widened for a moment, then he looked down at\nthe beautiful mosaic floor, and swallowed. When he lifted his face, Glokta\nwas surprised to see a bitter smile. “This is hardly what I had in mind when\nI joined the army.”\nGlokta tapped his ruined leg with his cane, and gave a twisted grin of his\nown. “I could say the same. What did Stolicus write? ‘The recruiting\nsergeant sells dreams but delivers nightmares’?”\n“That would seem appropriate to the case.”\n“If it’s any comfort, I doubt that my fate will be even as pleasant as\nyours.”\n“A small one.” And Vissbruck snapped his well-polished heels together\nand stood to vibrating attention. He remained like that for a moment,\nfrozen, then turned without a word for the door, soles clicking loud against\nthe floor and dying away in the corridor outside.\nGlokta looked over at Kahdia. “Regardless of what I said to the General,\nI would urge you to surrender the city at the earliest opportunity.”\nKahdia’s tired eyes slid up. “After all this? Now?”\nEspecially now. “Perhaps the Emperor will choose to be merciful. In any"

Now?”\nEspecially now. “Perhaps the Emperor will choose to be merciful. In any\ncase, I can see little advantage for you in fighting on. As things stand, there\nis still something to bargain with. You might be able to get some kind of\nterms.”\n“And that is the comfort you offer? The Emperor’s mercy?”\n“That’s all I have. What did you tell me about a man lost in the desert?”\nKahdia nodded slowly. “Whatever the outcome, I would like to thank\nyou.”\nThank me, you fool? “For what? Destroying your city and leaving you to\nthe Emperor’s mercy?”\n“For treating us with some measure of respect.”\nGlokta snorted. “Respect? I thought I simply told you whatever you\nwanted to hear, in order to get what I needed.”\n“Perhaps so. But thanks cost nothing. God go with you.”\n“God will not follow where I am going,” Glokta muttered as Kahdia\nshuffled slowly from the room.\nCosca grinned down his long nose. “Back to Adua, eh, Superior?”\n“Back, as you say, to Adua.” Back to the House of Questions. Back to\nArch Lector Sult. The thought was hardly a happy one.\n“Perhaps I’ll see you there.”\n“You think so?” More likely you’ll be butchered along with all the rest\nwhen the city falls. Then you’ll miss your opportunity to see me hanged.\n“If I’ve learned one thing, it’s that there’s always a chance.” Cosca\ngrinned as he pushed himself away from the wall and strutted towards the\ndoor, one hand rested jauntily on the pommel of his sword. “I hate to lose a\ngood employer.”\n“I’d hate to be lost. But prepare yourself for the possibility of\ndisappointment. Life is full of them.” And the manner of its ending is often\nthe greatest one of all.\n“Well then. If one of us should be disappointed.” And Cosca bowed in\nthe doorway with a theatrical flourish, the flaking gilt on his once\nmagnificent breastplate glinting in a shaft of morning sunlight. “It has been\nan honour.”\nG\nlokta sat on the bed, tonguing at his empty gums and rubbing his\nthrobbing leg. He looked around his quarters. Or Davoust’s quarters. That’s\nwhere an old wizard terrified me in the middle of the night. That’s where I\nwatched the city burn. That’s where I was nearly eaten by a fourteen-year-\nold girl. Ah, the happy memories…\nHe grimaced as he pushed himself up and limped over to the one box he\nhad brought with him. And this is where I signed a receipt for one million\nmarks, advanced by the banking house of Valint and Balk. He slid the flat\nleather case that Mauthis had given him out of his coat pocket. Half a\nmillion marks in polished stones, barely touched. He felt again the tugging\ntemptation to open it, to dig his hand inside and feel that cool, hard, clicking\ndistillation of wealth between his fingers.

He resisted with an effort, bent\ndown with a greater one, pushed some of the folded clothes aside with one\nhand, and dug the case down under them with the other. Black, black, and\nblack. I really should get a more varied wardrobe—\n“Going without saying goodbye?”\nGlokta jerked violently up from his stoop and nearly vomited at a\nsearing spasm through his back. He reached out with one arm and slammed\nthe box lid down just in time to flop onto it before his leg buckled. Vitari\nwas standing in the doorway, frowning over at him.\n“Damn it!” he hissed, blowing spit through the gaps in his teeth with\nevery heaving breath, left leg numb as wood, right leg cramping up with\nagony.\nShe padded into the room, narrowed eyes sliding left and right.\nChecking that there’s no one else here. A private interview, then. His heart\nwas starting to beat fast as she slowly shut the door, and not just from the\nspasms in his leg. The key rattled in the lock. Just the two of us. How\nterribly exciting.\nShe paced silently across the carpet, her long black shadow stretching\nout towards him. “I thought we had a deal,” hissed out from behind her\nmask.\n“So did I,” snapped Glokta, struggling to find a more dignified position.\n“Then I got a little note from Sult. He wants me back, and I think we can all\nguess why.”\n“Not because of anything I told him.”\n“So you say.”\nHer eyes narrowed further, her feet padded closer. “We had a deal. I kept\nmy end.”\n“Good for you! You can console yourself with that thought when I’m\nfloating facedown in the docks in Adua and you’re stuck here, waiting for\nthe Gurkish to break down the—oof!”\nAnd she was on him, her weight grinding his twisted back into the box,\nsqueezing the air from him in a ragged wheeze. There was a bright flash of\nmetal and the rattle of a chain, her fingers slid round his neck.\n“You crippled worm! I should cut your fucking throat right now!” Her\nknee jabbed painfully into his stomach, cold metal tickled gently at the skin\non his neck, her blue eyes glared into his, flickering back and forth,\nglistening hard as the stones in the box under his back. My death could be\nmoments away. Easily. He remembered watching her choke the life out of\nEider. With as little care as I might squash an ant, and I, poor cripple, just\nas helpless as one. Perhaps he should have been gibbering with fear, but all\nhe could think was, When was the last time I had a woman on top of me?\nHe snorted with laughter. “Don’t you know me at all?” he blubbered,\nhalf chuckling, half sobbing, eyes watering with a sickening mixture of pain\nand amusement. “Superior Glokta, pleased to meet you! I don’t care a good\nshit what you do, and you know it. Threats? You’ll have to do a sight better\nthan that, you ginger whore!”\nHer eyes bulged with fury. Her shoulder came forward, her elbow went\nback, ready to apply the greatest possible pressure. Enough to cut my neck"

Enough to cut my neck\nthrough to my twisted spine, I don’t doubt.\nGlokta felt his lips curl back in a sickly grin, wet with spit. Now.\nHe heard Vitari’s breath snorting behind her mask. Do it.\nHe felt the blade press against his neck, a chill touch, so sharp that he\ncould hardly feel it. I’m ready.\nThen she let out a long hiss, lifted the blade high and rammed it into the\nwood beside his head. She stood up and turned away from him. Glokta\nclosed his eyes and breathed for a moment. Still alive. There was an odd\nfeeling in his throat. Relief, or disappointment? Hard to tell the difference.\n“Please.” It was said so softly that he thought he might have imagined it.\nVitari was standing with her back to him, head bent over, fists clenched and\ntrembling.\n“What?”\n“Please.” She did say it. And it hurts her to do it, you can tell.\n“Please, eh? You think there’s any place here for ‘please’? Why the hell\nshould I save you, really? You came here to spy for Sult. You’ve done\nnothing but get in my way ever since you got here! It’s hard to think of\nanyone I trust less, and I don’t trust anyone!”\nShe turned back to face him, reached behind her head, took hold of the\nstraps of her mask, and pulled it off. There was a sharp tan line underneath:\nbrown round her eyes, her forehead, her neck, white round her mouth with a\npink mark across the bridge of her nose. Her face was far softer, much\nyounger, more ordinary than he had expected. She no longer looked\nfearsome. She looked scared and desperate. Glokta felt suddenly,\nludicrously awkward, as though he had blundered into a room and caught\nsomeone naked. He almost had to look away as she kneeled down level\nwith him.\n“Please.” Her eyes looked moist, dewy, her lip trembling as if she was\non the very point of weeping. A glimpse at the secret hopes beneath the\nvicious shell? Or just a good act? Glokta felt his eyelid fluttering. “It’s not\nfor myself,” she almost whispered. “Please. I’m begging you.”\nHe rubbed his hand thoughtfully across his neck. When he took it away\nthere was blood on his fingertip. The faintest brown smear. A nick. A graze.\nJust a hair’s breadth further, and I’d be pumping blood all over the lovely\ncarpet right now. Only a hair’s breadth. Lives turn on such chances. Why\nshould I save her?\nBut he knew why. Because I don’t save many.\nHe turned painfully round on the box so his back was to her and sat\nthere, kneading at the dead flesh of his left leg. He took a deep breath.\n“Alright,” he snapped.\n“You won’t regret it.”\n“I regret it already. Damn but I’m a fool for crying women! And you can\ncarry your own damn luggage!” He looked round, raising a finger, but Vitari"

And you can\ncarry your own damn luggage!” He looked round, raising a finger, but Vitari\nalready had the mask back on. Her eyes were dry, and narrow, and fierce.\nThey look like eyes that couldn’t shed a tear in a hundred years.\n“Don’t worry.” She jerked on the chain round her wrist, and the cross-\nshaped blade sprang from the lid of the box and slapped into her waiting\npalm. “I travel light.”\nG\nlokta watched the flames reflected in the calm surface of the bay. Shifting\nfragments, red, yellow, sparkling white in the black water. Frost pulled at\nthe oars, smoothly, evenly, his pale face half-lit by the flickering fires in the\ncity, expressionless. Severard sat behind him, hunched over, glowering out\nacross the water. Vitari was beyond, in the prow, her head no more than a\nspiky outline. The blades dipped into the sea and feathered the water with\nbarely a sound. It hardly seemed that the boat moved. Rather the dark\noutline of the peninsula slipped slowly away from them, into the darkness.\nWhat have I done? Consigned a city full of people to death or slavery,\nfor what? For the King’s honour? A drooling half-wit who can scarcely\ncontrol his bowels, let alone a country. For my pride? Hah. I threw it all\naway long ago, along with my teeth. For Sult’s approval? My reward is like\nto be a rope collar and a long drop.\nHe could just see the darker outline of the rock against the dark night\nsky, the craggy form of the Citadel perched on top of it. Perhaps even the\nslender shapes of the spires of the Great Temple. All moving off into the\npast.\nWhat could I have done differently? I could have thrown in my lot with\nEider and the rest. Given the city away to the Gurkish without a fight.\nWould that have changed anything? Glokta licked sourly at his empty\ngums. The Emperor would have set about his purges just the same. Sult\nwould have sent for me, just as he has done. Little differences, hardly worth\ncommenting on. What did Shickel say? “Few indeed are those who get a\nchoice.”\nA chill breeze blew and Glokta pulled his coat tight around him, folded\nhis arms across his chest, winced as he worked his numb foot back and\nforward in his boot, trying to make the blood flow. The city was nothing but\na dusting of pinprick lights, far away.\nIt is just as Eider said—all so the Arch Lector and his like can point at a\nmap and say this dot or that is ours. His mouth twitched into a smile. And\nafter all the efforts, all the sacrifices, all the scheming, and plotting, and\nkilling, we could not even hold the city. All that pain, for what?\nThere was no reply, of course. Only the calm waves lapping against the\nside of the boat, the soft creaking of the rowlocks, the soothing slap, slap of\nthe oars on the water. He wanted to feel disgust at himself.

Pity for all those left behind to Gurkish mercy. The way other\nmen might. The way I might have, long ago. But it was hard to feel much of\nanything beyond the overwhelming tiredness and the endless, nagging ache\nup his leg, through his back, into his neck. He winced as he sagged back on\nhis wooden seat, searching, as always, for a less painful position. There is\nno need to punish myself, after all.\nPunishment will come soon enough.\nJewel of Cities\nA\nt least he could ride now. The splints had come off that morning, and\nJezal’s sore leg knocked painfully against his horse’s flank as it moved. His\nhand was numb and clumsy on the reins, his arm weak and aching without\nthe dressing. His teeth still throbbed dully with every thump of the hooves\non the ruined road. But at least he was out of the cart, and that was\nsomething. Small things seemed to make him very happy these days.\nThe others rode in a sombre, silent group, grim as mourners at a funeral,\nand Jezal hardly blamed them. It was a sombre sort of place. A plain of dirt.\nOf fissures of bare rock. Of sand and stone, empty of life. The sky was a\nstill, white nothing, heavy as pale lead, promising rain but never quite\ndelivering. They rode clustered round the cart as though huddling for\nwarmth, the only warm things in a hundred miles of cold desert, the only\nmoving things in a place frozen in time, the only living things in a dead\ncountry.\nThe road was wide, but the stones were cracked and buckled. In places\nwhole stretches of it had crumbled away, in others flows of mud had\ncovered it entirely. The dead stumps of trees jutted from the bare earth to\neither side. Bayaz must have seen him looking at them.\n“An avenue of proud oaks lined this road for twenty miles from the city\ngates. In summer their leaves shimmered and shook in the wind over the\nplain. Juvens planted them with his own hands, in the Old Time, when the\nEmpire was young, long before even I was born.”\nThe mutilated stumps were grey and dry, splintered edges still showing\nthe marks of saws. “They look as if they were cut down months ago.”\n“Many long years, my boy. When Glustrod seized the city, he had them\nall felled to feed his furnaces.”\n“Then why have they not rotted?”\n“Even rot is a kind of life. There is no life here.”\nJezal swallowed and hunched his shoulders, watching the chunks of\nlong-dead wood file slowly past like rows of tombstones. “I don’t like this,”\nhe muttered under his breath.\n“You think I do?” Bayaz frowned grimly over at him. “You think any of\nus do? Men must sometimes do what they do not like if they are to be\nremembered. It is through struggle, not ease, that fame and honour are won.\nIt is through conflict, not peace, that wealth and power are gained. Do such"

Do such\nthings no longer interest you?”\n“Yes,” muttered Jezal, “I suppose…” But he was far from sure. He\nlooked out across the sea of dead dirt. There was precious little sign of\nhonour out here, let alone wealth, and it was hard to see where fame would\ncome from. He was already well known to the only five people within a\nhundred miles. Besides, he was starting to wonder if a long, poor life in\nutter obscurity would really be such a terrible thing.\nPerhaps, when he got home, he would ask Ardee to marry him. He\namused himself by imagining her smile when he suggested it. No doubt she\nwould make him squirm, waiting for an answer. No doubt she would keep\nhim dangling. No doubt she would say yes. What, after all, was the worst\nthat could happen? Would his father be angry? Would they be forced to live\non his officer’s pay? Would his shallow friends and his idiot brothers\nchuckle at his back to see him so reduced in the world? He almost laughed\nto think that those had seemed weighty reasons.\nA life of hard work with the woman he loved beside him? A rented\nhouse in an unfashionable part of town, with cheap furniture but a cosy fire?\nNo fame, no power, no wealth, but a warm bed with Ardee in it, waiting for\nhim.… That hardly seemed like such a terrible fate now that he had looked\ndeath in the face, when he was living on a bowl of porridge a day and\nfeeling grateful to get it, when he was sleeping alone out in the wind and\nthe rain.\nHis grin grew wider, and the feeling of the sore skin stretching across his\njaw was almost pleasant. That did not seem like such a bad life at all.\nT\nhe great walls thrust up sheer, scabbed with broken battlements, blistered\nwith shattered towers, scarred with black cracks and slick with wet. A cliff\nof dark stone, curving away out of sight into the grey drizzle, the bare earth\nin front of it pooled with brown water and scattered with toppled blocks as\nbig as coffins.\n“Aulcus,” growled Bayaz, jaw set hard. “Jewel of cities.”\n“I don’t see it sparkling,” grunted Ferro.\nNeither did Logen. The slimy road slunk up to a crumbling archway,\ngaping open, full of shadows, the doors themselves long gone. He had an\nawful feeling as he looked at that dark gate. A sick feeling. Like the one he\nhad when he looked into the open door of the Maker’s House. As if he was\nlooking into a grave, and possibly his own. All he could think about was\nturning round and never coming back. His horse nickered softly and took a\nstep away, its breath smoking in the misty rain. The hundreds of long and\ndangerous miles back to the sea seemed suddenly an easier journey than the\nfew strides to that gate.\n“Are you sure about this?” he murmured to Bayaz.\n“Am I sure? No, of course not! I brought us weary leagues across the\nbarren plain on a whim! I spent years planning the journey, and gathered"

No harm will be done if we simply toddle back to\nCalcis. Am I sure?” He shook his head as he urged his horse towards the\nyawning gateway.\nLogen shrugged his shoulders. “Only asking.” The arch gaped wider,\nand wider, then swallowed them whole. The sound of the horses’ hooves\nechoed down the long tunnel, clattering around them in the darkness. The\nweight of stone all around pressed in close and seemed to make it hard to\ntake a breath. Logen put his head down, frowning towards the circle of light\nat the far end as it grew steadily bigger. He glanced sideways and caught\nLuthar’s eye, licking his lips nervously in the gloom, wet hair plastered to\nhis face.\nAnd then they came out into the open.\n“My, my,” breathed Longfoot. “My, my, my…”\nColossal buildings rose up on either side of a vast square. The ghosts of\ntall pillars and high roofs, of towering columns and great walls, all made for\ngiants, loomed from the haze of rain. Logen gawped. They all did, a tiny,\nhuddled group in that outsize space, like scared sheep in a bare valley,\nwaiting for the wolves to come.\nRain hissed on stone high overhead, falling water splattered on the slick\ncobbles, trickled down the crumbling walls, gurgled in the cracks in the\nroad. The thudding of hooves fell muffled. The cartwheels gently croaked\nand groaned. No other noise. No bustle, no din, no chatter of crowds. No\nbirds calling, no dogs barking, no clatter of trade and commerce. Nothing\nlived. Nothing moved. There were only the great black buildings, stretching\nfar away into the rain, and the ripped clouds crawling across the dark sky\nabove.\nThey rode slowly past the ruins of some fallen temple, a tangled mass of\ndripping blocks and slabs, sections of its monstrous columns scattered on\ntheir sides across the broken paving, fragments from its roof thrown wide,\nstill lying where they fell. Luthar’s wet face, apart from the pink stain\nacross his chin, was chalky white as he gazed up at the soaring wreckage to\neither side. “Bloody hell,” he muttered.\n“It is indeed,” murmured Longfoot under his breath, “a most impressive\nsight.”\n“The palaces of the wealthy dead,” said Bayaz. “The temples where they\nprayed to angry gods. The markets where they bought and sold goods, and\nanimals, and people. Where they bought and sold each other. The theatres,\nand the baths, and the brothels where they indulged their passions, before\nGlustrod came.” He pointed across the square and down the valley of\ndripping stone beyond. “This is the Caline Way. The greatest road of the\ncity, and where the greatest citizens had their dwellings. It runs straight\nthrough, more or less, from the northern gate to the southern. Now listen to\nme,” he said, turning in his creaking saddle. “Three miles south of the city"

Now listen to\nme,” he said, turning in his creaking saddle. “Three miles south of the city\nthere is a high hill, with a temple on its summit. The Saturline Rock, they\ncalled it in the Old Time. If we should become separated, that is where we\nwill meet.”\n“Why would we be separated?” asked Luthar, his eyes wide.\n“The earth in the city is… unquiet, and prone to tremble. The buildings\nare ancient, and unstable. I hope that we will pass through without incident,\nbut… it would be rash to rely on hope alone. If anything should happen,\nhead south. Toward the Saturline Rock. Until then, stay close together.”\nThat hardly needed saying. Logen looked over at Ferro as they set off\ninto the city, her black hair spiky, her dark face dewy with wet, frowning up\nsuspiciously at the towering buildings to either side. “If anything should\nhappen,” he whispered to her, “help me out, eh?”\nShe looked at him for a moment, then nodded. “If I can, pink.”\n“Good enough.”\nT\nhe only thing worse than a city full of people is a city with no people at\nall.\nFerro rode with her bow in one hand, the reins in the other, staring to\nboth sides, peering down the alleys, into the gaping windows and doorways,\nstraining to see round the crumbling corners and over the broken walls. She\ndid not know what she was looking for.\nBut she would be ready.\nThey all felt as she did, she could see it. She watched the fibres of jaw\nmuscle tensing and relaxing, tensing and relaxing, over and over, on the\nside of Ninefingers’ head as he frowned off into the ruins, his hand never far\nfrom the grip of his sword, scored cold metal shining with beads of\nmoisture.\nLuthar jumped at every noise—at the crack of a stone under the\ncartwheels, at the splatter of falling water into a pool, at the snort of one of\nthe horses, his head jerking this way and that, the tip of his tongue licking\nendlessly at the slot in his lip.\nQuai sat on the cart, bent over with his wet hair flapping round his gaunt\nface, pale lips pressed together into a hard line. Ferro watched him snap the\nreins, saw he was gripping them so tightly that the tendons stood out stark\nfrom the backs of his thin hands. Longfoot stared about him at the endless\nruins, eyes and mouth hanging slightly open, rivulets of water occasionally\nstreaking through the stubble on his knobbly skull. For once he had nothing\nto say—the one small advantage of this place abandoned by God.\nBayaz was trying to look confident, but Ferro knew better. She watched\nhis hand tremble when he took it from the reins to rub the water from his\nthick brows. She watched his mouth work when they stopped at junctions,\nwatched him squinting into the rain, trying to reckon the right course. She\nsaw his worry and his doubt written in his every movement. He knew as\nwell as she did. This place was not safe.\nClick-clank."

She stood up in her stirrups,\nstraining to listen.\n“Do you hear that?” she snapped at Ninefingers.\nHe paused, squinting off at nothing, listening. Click-clank. He nodded\nslowly. “I hear it.” He slid his sword out from its sheath.\n“What?” Luthar stared around wild-eyed, fumbling for his own\nweapons.\n“There’s nothing out there,” grumbled Bayaz.\nShe jabbed her palm at them to stop, slid down from her saddle, and\ncrept up to the corner of the next building, nocking an arrow to her bow,\nback sliding across the rough surface of the huge stone blocks. Clank-click.\nShe could feel Ninefingers following, moving carefully, a reassuring\npresence behind her.\nShe slid round the corner onto one knee, peering across an empty square\npocked with pools and strewn with rubble. There was a high tower at the far\ncorner leaning over to one side, wide windows hanging open at its summit\nunder a tarnished dome. Something was moving in there, slowly. Something\ndark, rocking back and forth. She almost smiled to have something she\ncould point an arrow at.\nIt was a good feeling, having an enemy.\nThen she heard hooves and Bayaz rode past, out into the ruined square.\n“Ssss!” she hissed at him, but he ignored her.\n“You can put your weapons away,” he called over his shoulder. “It’s\nnothing but an old bell, clicking in the wind. The city was full of them. You\nshould have heard them pealing out, when an Emperor was born, or\ncrowned, or married, or welcomed back from a victorious campaign.” He\nstarted to raise his arms, voice growing louder. “The air split with their\njoyous ringing, and birds rose up from every square and street and roof and\nfilled the sky!” He was shouting now, bellowing it out. “And the people\nlined the streets! And they leaned from their windows! And they showered\nthe beloved with flower petals! And cheered until their voices were hoarse!”\nHe started to laugh, and he let his arms fall, and high above him the broken\nbell clicked and clanked in the wind. “Long ago. Come on.”\nQuai snapped the reins and the cart trundled off after the Magus.\nNinefingers shrugged at her and sheathed his sword.

Some were\nworked with bronze: huge helmets, swords, sceptres, crowns of leaves, all\nturned chalky green leaving dirty streaks down the gleaming stone. The\nstatues swam up out of the angry rain, and one pair of giants at a time they\nvanished into the rain behind, consigned to the mists of history.\n“Emperors,” said Bayaz. “Hundreds of years of them.”\nJezal watched the rulers of antiquity file menacingly past, looming over\nthe broken road, his neck aching from looking up, the rain tickling at his\nface. The sculptures were twice the height or more of the ones in the\nAgriont, but there was similarity enough to cause a sudden wave of\nhomesickness.\n“Just like to the Kingsway, in Adua.”\n“Huh,” grunted Bayaz. “Where do you think I got the idea?”\nJezal was just absorbing that bizarre comment when he noticed that the\nstatues they were approaching now were the last pair, one tilted over at a\nworrying angle.\n“Hold up the cart!” called Bayaz, raising one wet palm and nudging his\nhorse forward.\nNot only were there no more Emperors before them, there was no road\nat all. A dizzy drop yawned out of the earth, a mighty crack in the fabric of\nthe city. Squinting across, Jezal could just see the far side, a cliff of broken\nrock and crumbled mud. Beyond were the faint wraiths of walls and pillars,\nthe outline of the wide avenue melting out of sight and back as the rain\nswept through the empty air between.\nLongfoot cleared his throat. “I take it we will not be carrying on this\nway.”\nEver so carefully Jezal leaned from his saddle and peered down. Far\nbelow, dark water moved, foaming and churning, washing at the tortured\nground beneath the foundations of the city, and out of this subterranean sea\nstuck broken walls, and shattered towers, and the cracked-open shells of\nmonstrous buildings. At the top of one tottering column a statue still stood,\nsome hero long dead. His hand must once have been raised in triumph. Now\nit stuck up in desperation, as if he was pleading for someone to drag him\nfrom his watery hell.\nJezal sat back, feeling suddenly dizzy. “We will not be carrying on this\nway,” he managed to croak.\nBayaz frowned grimly down at the grinding water. “Then we must find\nanother, and quickly. The city is full of these cracks. We have miles to go,\neven on a straight course, and a bridge to cross.”\nLongfoot frowned. “Providing it still stands.”\n“It still stands! Kanedias built to last.” The First of the Magi peered up\ninto the rain. The sky was already bruising, a dark weight hanging above\ntheir heads. “We cannot afford to linger. We will not make it through the\ncity before dark as it is.”\nJezal looked up at the Magus, horrified. “We’ll be here overnight?”\n“Clearly,” snapped Bayaz, turning his horse away from the brink.\nThe ruins crowded in tighter around them as they left the Caline Way"

        "text": "“Clearly,” snapped Bayaz, turning his horse away from the brink.\nThe ruins crowded in tighter around them as they left the Caline Way\nbehind and struck out into the thick of the city. Jezal gazed up at the\nthreatening shadows looming from the murk. The only thing he could\nimagine worse than being trapped in this place by day was being kept here\nin the darkness. He would have preferred to spend the night in hell. But\nwhat would have been the difference?\nT\nhe river surged below them through a man-made canyon—tall\nembankments of smooth, wet stone. The mighty Aos, imprisoned in that\nnarrow space, foamed with infinite, mindless fury, chewing at the polished\nrock and spitting angry spray high into the air. Ferro could not imagine how\nanything could have lasted for long above that deluge, but Bayaz had been\nright.\nThe Maker’s bridge still stood.\n“In all my wide travels, in every city and nation under the bountiful sun,\nI have never seen such a wonder.” Longfoot slowly shook his shaven head.\n“How can a bridge be made from metal?”\nBut metal it was. Dark, smooth, lustreless, gleaming with drops of water.\nIt soared across the dizzy space in one simple arch, impossibly delicate, a\nspider’s web of thin rods crisscrossing the hollow air beneath it, a wide road\nof slotted metal plates stretching out perfectly level across the top, inviting\nthem to cross. Every edge was sharp, every curve precise, every surface\nclean. It stood pristine in the midst of all that slow decay. “As if it was\nfinished yesterday,” muttered Quai.\n“And yet it is perhaps the oldest thing in the city.” Bayaz nodded\ntowards the ruins behind them. “All the achievements of Juvens are laid\nwaste. Fallen, broken, forgotten, almost as though they had never been. But\nthe works of the Master Maker are undiminished. They shine the brighter, if\nanything, for they shine in a darkened world.” He snorted, and mist blew\nfrom his nostrils. “Who knows? Perhaps they will still stand whole and\nunmarked at the end of time, long after all of us are in our graves.”\nLuthar peered nervously down towards the thundering water, no doubt\nwondering if his grave might be there. “You’re sure it will carry us?”\n“In the Old Time it carried thousands of people a day. Tens of thousands.\nHorses and carts and citizens and slaves in an endless procession, flowing\nboth ways, day and night. It will carry us.” Ferro watched as the hooves of\nBayaz’s horse clanged out onto the metal.\n“This Maker was plainly a man of… quite remarkable talents,”\nmurmured the Navigator, urging his horse after.\nQuai snapped his reins. “He was indeed. All lost to the world.”\nNinefingers went next, then Luthar reluctantly followed. Ferro stayed\nwhere she was, sitting in the pattering rain, frowning at the bridge, at the\ncart, at the four horses and their riders. She did not like this. The river, the\nbridge, the city, none of it. It had been feeling more and more like a trap\nwith every step, and now she felt sure of it. She should never have listened"

She should never have left the South. She had no business here,\nout in this freezing, wet, deserted wasteland with this gang of godless pinks.\n“I am not going over that,” she said.\nBayaz turned to look at her. “Do you plan to fly across, then? Or simply\nstay on that side?”\nShe sat back and crossed her hands before her on the saddlebow.\n“Perhaps I will.”\n“It might be better to discuss such matters once we have made it through\nthe city,” murmured Brother Longfoot, looking nervously back into the\nempty streets.\n“He’s right,” said Luthar. “This place has an evil air—”\n“Shit on its air,” growled Ferro, “and shit on you. Why should I cross?\nWhat is it exactly, that is so useful to me about that side of a river? You\nhave promised me vengeance, old pink, and given me nothing but lies, and\nrain, and bad food. Why should I take another stride with you? Tell me\nthat!”\nBayaz frowned. “My brother Yulwei helped you in the desert. You\nwould have been killed if not for him. You gave him your word—”\n“Word? Hah! A word is an easy chain to break, old man.” And she\njerked her wrists apart in front of her. “There. I am free of it. I did not\npromise to make a slave of myself!”\nThe Magus gave vent to a long sigh, slumping wearily forward in his\nsaddle. “As if life were not hard enough without your contributions. Why is\nit, Ferro, that you would rather make things difficult than easy?”\n“Perhaps God had some purpose in mind when he made me so, but I do\nnot know it. What is the Seed?”\nStraight to the root of the matter. The old pink’s eye seemed to give a\nsudden twitch as she said the word. “Seed?” muttered Luthar, baffled.\nBayaz frowned at the puzzled faces of the others. “It might be better not\nto know.”\n“Not good enough. If you fall asleep for a week again, I want to know\nwhat we are doing, and why.”\n“I am well recovered now,” snapped Bayaz, but Ferro knew it for a lie.\nEvery part of him seemed shrunken, older, and weaker than it had been. He\nmight have been awake, and talking, but he was far from recovered. It\nwould take more than bland assurances to fool her. “It will not happen\nagain, you can depend on—”\n“I will ask you one more time, and hope at last for a simple answer.\nWhat is the Seed?”\nBayaz looked at her for a long moment, and she looked back. “Very\nwell. We will sit in the rain and discuss the nature of things.” And he\nnudged his horse back off the bridge until it was no more than a stride away.\n“The Seed is one name for that thing that Glustrod dug for in the deep earth.\nIt is that thing he used to do all this.”\n“This?” grunted Ninefingers.\n“All this.” And the First of the Magi swept his arm towards the"

        "text": "It is that thing he used to do all this.”\n“This?” grunted Ninefingers.\n“All this.” And the First of the Magi swept his arm towards the\nwreckage that surrounded them. “The Seed made a ruin of the greatest city\nin the world, and blighted the land about it from now until eternity.”\n“It is a weapon, then?” murmured Ferro.\n“It is a stone,” said Quai suddenly, hunched on his cart, looking at no\none. “A rock from the world below. Left behind, buried, when Euz cast the\ndevils from our world. It is the Other Side made flesh. The very stuff of\nmagic.”\n“It is indeed,” whispered Bayaz. “My congratulations, Master Quai. One\nsubject at least of which you are not entirely ignorant. Well? Answers\nenough for you, Ferro?”\n“A rock did all this?” Ninefingers did not look happy. “What in hell do\nwe want with it?”\n“I think some among us can guess.” Bayaz was looking at Ferro, right in\nthe eye, and smiling a sickly grin, as if he knew exactly what she thought.\nPerhaps he did.\nIt was no secret.\nStories of devils, and digging, and old wet ruins, none of that mattered\nto Ferro. She was busy imagining the Empire of Gurkhul made a dead land.\nIts people vanished. Its Emperor forgotten. Its cities brought to dust. Its\npower a faded memory. Her mind churned with thoughts of death and\nvengeance. Then she smiled.\n“Good,” she said. “But why do you need me?”\n“Who says I do need you that badly?”\nShe snorted at him. “I doubt you would have suffered me this long if\nyou didn’t.”\n“True enough.”\n“Then why?”\n“Because the Seed cannot be touched. It is painful even to look upon.\nWe came into the shattered city with the Emperor’s army, after the fall of\nGlustrod, searching for survivors. We found none. Only horrors, and ruins,\nand bodies. Too many of those to count. Thousands upon thousands we\nburied, in pits for a hundred each, all through the city. It was long work, and\nwhile we were about it, a company of soldiers found something strange in\nthe ruins. Their Captain wrapped it in his cloak and brought it to Juvens. By\ndusk he had withered and died, and his company were not spared. Their hair\nfell out, their bodies shrivelled. Within a week all hundred men were\ncorpses. But Juvens himself was unharmed.” He nodded at the cart. “That is\nwhy Kanedias made the box, and that is why we have it with us now. To\nprotect us. None of us are safe. Except for you.”\n“Why me?”\n“Did you never wonder why you are not as others are? Why you see no\ncolours? Why you feel no pain? You are what Juvens was, and Kanedias.\nYou are what Glustrod was. You are what Euz himself was, if it comes to\nthat.”\n“Devil-blood,” murmured Quai. “Blessed and cursed.”\nFerro glowered at him. “What do you mean?”\n“You are descended from demons.” And one corner of the apprentice’s"

You are a relic. A last\nweak trace of the blood of the Other Side.”\nFerro opened her mouth to snarl an insult back at him, but Bayaz cut her\noff.\n“There can be no denying it, Ferro. I would not have brought you if\nthere were any doubt. But you should not seek to deny it. You should\nembrace it. It is a rare gift. You can touch the Seed. Perhaps only you in all\nthe wide Circle of the World. Only you can touch it, and only you can carry\nit to war.” He leaned close and whispered to her. “But only I can make it\nburn. Hot enough to turn all Gurkhul to a desert. Hot enough to make bitter\nashes of Khalul and all his servants. Hot enough to make such vengeance\nthat even you will have your fill of it, and more. Are you coming now?”\nAnd he clicked his tongue, pulling his horse away and back onto the bridge.\nFerro frowned at the old pink’s back as she rode after him, chewing hard\nat her lip. When she licked it, she tasted blood. Blood, but no pain. She did\nnot like to believe anything the Magus said, but there was no denying that\nshe was not as others were. She remembered she had bitten Aruf once, and\nhe had told her that she must have had a snake for a mother. Why not a\ndemon? She watched the water thundering by far below, through the slots in\nthe metal, frowning, and thinking on vengeance.\n“Don’t hardly matter whose blood you’ve got.” Ninefingers was riding\nbeside her. Riding badly, as usual, and looking across, voice gentle. “Man\nmakes his own choices, my father used to tell me. Reckon that goes for\nwomen just as much.”\nFerro did not answer. She dragged on her reins and let the others pull\nahead. Woman, or demon, or snake, it made no difference. Her concern was\nhurting the Gurkish. Her hatred was strong, and deep-rooted, warm and\nfamiliar. Her oldest friend.\nShe could trust nothing else.\nFerro was the last one off the bridge. She took a look back over her\nshoulder as they moved off into the crumbling city, towards the ruins they\nhad come from, half-hidden on the far bank by the grey shroud of drizzle.\n“Ssss!” She jerked on her reins, glaring over the surging water, eyes\nflicking over the hundreds of empty windows, the hundreds of empty\ndoorways, the hundreds of cracks and gaps and spaces in the crumbling\nwalls.\n“What did you see?” came Ninefingers’ worried voice.\n“Something.” But she saw nothing now. Along the crumbling\nembankment the endless shells of buildings squatted, empty and lifeless.\n“There is nothing left alive in this place,” said Bayaz. “Night will find us\nsoon, and I for one could do with a roof to keep the rain off my old bones\ntonight. Your eyes are playing tricks.”"

She felt it.\nWatching them.\nLuck\nU\np you get, Luthar.” Jezal’s eyes fluttered open. It was so bright that he\ncould hardly make out where he was, and he grunted and blinked, shading\nhis eyes with one hand. Someone had been shaking his shoulder.\nNinefingers.\n“We need to be on our way.”\nJezal sat up. Sunlight was streaming into the narrow chamber, straight\ninto his face, specks of dust floating in the glare. “Where is everyone?” he\ncroaked, tongue thick and lazy with sleep.\nThe Northman jerked his shaggy head towards the tall window.\nSquinting, Jezal could just see Brother Longfoot standing there, looking\nout, hands clasped behind him. “Our Navigator’s taking in the view. Rest of\nthe crew are out front, seeing to the horses, reckoning the route. Thought\nyou might use a few minutes more under the blanket.”\n“Thanks.” He could have used a few hours more yet. Jezal worked his\nsour mouth, licking at the aching holes in his teeth, the sore crease in his\nlip, checking how painful they were this morning. Every day the swelling\nwas a little less. He was almost getting used to it.\n“Here.” Jezal looked up to see Ninefingers tossing him a biscuit. He\ntried to catch it, but his bad hand was still clumsy and it dropped in the dirt.\nThe Northman shrugged. “Bit of dust won’t do you any harm.”\n“Daresay it won’t, at that.” Jezal picked it up, brushed it off with the\nback of his hand, and took a dry bite from it, making sure to use the good\nside of his mouth. He threw his blanket back, rolled over, and pushed\nhimself stiffly from the ground.\nLogen watched him take a few trial steps, arms spread out wide for\nbalance, biscuit clutched in one hand. “How’s the leg?”\n“It’s been worse.” It had been better too. He walked with a fool of a\nlimp, sore leg held straight. The knee and the ankle hurt every time he put\nhis weight on it, but he could walk, and every morning it was improving.\nWhen he made it to the rough stone wall, he closed his eyes and took a deep\nbreath, half wanting to laugh, half wanting to cry with relief at the simple\njoy of being able to stand on his own feet again.\n“From now on I will be grateful for every moment that I can walk.”\nNinefingers grinned. “That feeling lasts a day or two, then you’ll be\nmoaning about the food again.”\n“I will not,” said Jezal firmly.\n“Alright. A week then.” He walked towards the window at the far end of\nthe room, casting a stretched-out shadow across the dusty floor. “In the\nmeantime, you should have a look at this.”"

A week then.” He walked towards the window at the far end of\nthe room, casting a stretched-out shadow across the dusty floor. “In the\nmeantime, you should have a look at this.”\n“At what?” Jezal hopped up beside Brother Longfoot, leaned against the\npitted column at the side of the window, breathing hard and shaking out his\naching leg. Then he looked up, and his mouth fell open.\nThey must have been high up. At the top of the steep slope of a hill\nperhaps, looking out over the city. The just-risen sun hung level with Jezal’s\neyes, watery yellow through the morning haze. The sky was clear and pale\nabove it, a few shreds of white cloud stretched out, almost still.\nEven in ruins, hundreds of years after its fall, the vista of Aulcus was\nbreathtaking.\nBroken roofs stretched away into the far distance, crumbling walls\nbrightly lit or sunk in long shadows. Stately domes, teetering towers,\nleaping arches, and proud columns thrust up above the jumble. He could\nmake out the gaps left by wide squares, by broad avenues, the yawning\nspace cut by the river, curving gently through the forest of stone on his\nright, light glittering on the shifting water. In every direction, as far as Jezal\ncould see, wet stone glowed in the morning sun.\n“And this is why I love to travel,” breathed Longfoot. “At one stroke, in\none moment, this whole journey has been made worthwhile. Has there ever\nbeen such another sight? How many men living can have gazed upon it?\nThe three of us stand at a window upon history, at a gate into the long-\nforgotten past. No longer will I dream of fair Talins, glittering on the sea in\nthe red morning, or Ul-Nahb, glowing beneath the azure bowl of the\nheavens in the bright midday, or Ospria, proud upon her mountain slopes,\nlights shining like the stars in the soft evening. From this day forth, my\nheart will forever belong to Aulcus. Truly, the jewel of cities. Sublime\nbeyond words in death, dare one even dream of how she must have looked\nin life? Who could not be struck with wonder at the magnificence of this\nsight? Who could not be struck with awe at the—”\n“A load of old buildings,” growled Ferro, right behind him. “And it is\npast time we were out of them. Get your gear stowed.” And she turned and\nstalked off towards the entrance.\nJezal frowned back over his shoulder at the gleaming sweep of dark\nruins stretching away into the distant haze. There was no denying that it was\nmagnificent, and yet it was frightening as well. The splendid buildings of\nAdua, the mighty walls and towers of the Agriont: All that Jezal had\nthought of as magnificent seemed mean and feeble copies. He felt like a\ntiny, ignorant boy, from a small and barbaric country, in a petty,\ninsignificant time. He was glad to turn away, and to leave the jewel of cities\nin the past, where it belonged.

He would not be dreaming of Aulcus.\nNightmares, maybe.\nIt must have been late morning when they came upon the only square in\nthe city that was still crowded. A giant space, and thronging from one side\nto the other. A motionless, silent crowd. A crowd carved from stone.\nStatues of every attitude, size, and material. There was black basalt and\nwhite marble, green alabaster and red porphyry, grey granite and a hundred\nother stones of which Jezal could not guess the names. The variety was\nstrange enough, but it was the one thing they all had in common which he\nfound truly worrying. Not one of them had a face.\nColossal features had been picked away, leaving formless messes of\npock-marked rock. Small ones had been hacked out, leaving empty craters\nof rough stone. Ugly messages in some script that Jezal did not recognise\nhad been chiselled across marble chests, down arms, round necks, into\nforeheads. It seemed that everything in Aulcus had been done on an epic\nscale, and the vandalism was no exception.\nThere was a path cleared through the middle of this sinister wreckage,\nwide enough for the cart to pass. So Jezal rode out, at the front of the group,\nthrough a forest of faceless shapes, crowded in on either side like the throng\nat a procession of state.\n“What happened here?” he murmured.\nBayaz frowned up at a head that might easily have been ten strides high,\nits lips still pressed into a powerful frown, its eyes and nose all chopped\naway, harsh writing cut deep into its cheek. “When Glustrod seized the city,\nhe gave his cursed army one day to make free with its people. To satisfy\ntheir fury, and quench their lust for plunder, rape, and murder. As though\nthey could ever be satisfied.” Ninefingers coughed and shifted\nuncomfortably in his saddle. “Then they were ordered to tear down all the\nstatues of Juvens in the city. From every roof, from every hall, from every\nfrieze and temple. There were many likenesses of my master in Aulcus, for\nthe city was his design. But Glustrod was nothing if not thorough. He\nsought them all out, and had them gathered here, and defaced them all, and\nstamped into them terrible curses.”\n“Not a happy family.” Jezal had never seen eye to eye with his own\nbrothers, but this seemed to him a little excessive. He ducked away from the\noutstretched fingers of a giant hand, standing upright on its severed wrist, a\nragged symbol chiselled savagely out of the palm.\n“What does it say?”\nBayaz frowned. “Believe me, it is better you do not know.”\nA colossal building, even by the standards of this giant’s graveyard,\ntowered over the army of sculptures at one side. Its steps were high as a city\nwall, the columns of its façade as thick as towers, its monstrous pediment\nencrusted with faded carvings. Bayaz reined his horse up before it and\nstared up. Jezal stopped behind him, glancing nervously at the others.\n“Let’s keep on.” Ninefingers scratched at his face and stared round"

I’d never have\nbelieved it.”\n“Every shadow’s cast by something,” growled the Northman, but the\nFirst of the Magi was not to be put off.\n“We have time enough to stop,” he said as he struggled from the saddle.\n“We are close to the edge of the city, now. An hour at the most and we are\nout and on our way. You might find this interesting, Captain Luthar. As\nwould anyone else who would care to join me.”\nNinefingers cursed under his breath in his own tongue. “Alright, then.\nI’d rather walk than wait.”\n“You have quite piqued my curiosity,” said Brother Longfoot as he\njumped down next to them. “I must confess that the city does not seem so\ndaunting in the light as it did in the rain of yesterday. Indeed, it is hard now\nto see why it has such a black reputation. Nowhere in all the Circle of the\nWorld can there be such a collection of fascinating relics, and I am a\ncurious man, and unashamed to admit it. Yes indeed, I have always been a\n—”\n“We know what you are,” hissed Ferro. “I’ll wait here.”\n“Please yourself.” Bayaz dragged his staff from his saddle. “As always.\nYou and Master Quai can no doubt each delight the other with comical tales\nwhile we are gone. I am almost sorry to miss the banter.” Ferro and the\napprentice frowned at each other as the rest of them made their way\nbetween the ruined statues and up the wide steps, Jezal limping and wincing\non his bad leg. They passed through a doorway as big as a house and into a\ncool, dim, silent space.\nIt reminded Jezal of the Lords’ Round in Adua, but even bigger. A\ncavernous, circular chamber, like a great bowl with stepped seating up the\nsides, carved from stone of many colours, whole sections of it smashed and\nruined. The bottom was choked with rubble, no doubt the remnants of a\ncollapsed roof.\n“Ah. The great dome fallen.” The Magus squinted up through the ragged\nspace into the bright sky beyond. “A fitting metaphor.” He sighed, shuffling\nslowly round the curving aisle between the marble shelves. Jezal frowned\nup at that vast weight of overhanging stone, wondering what might happen\nif a chunk of it should fall and hit him on the head. He doubted Ferro would\nbe stitching that up. He had not the slightest idea why Bayaz wanted him\nhere, but then he could have said that for the whole journey, and indeed he\noften had. So he took a deep breath and limped out after the Magus,\nNinefingers just behind, the noises of their movement echoing around in the\ngreat space.\nLongfoot picked his way among the broken steps and peered up at the\nfallen ceiling with a show of great interest. “What was this place?” he\ncalled out, voice bouncing from the curved walls. “Some manner of"

Here the Emperor sat in state, to hear debates between the wisest\ncitizens of Aulcus. Here decisions were made that have set the course of\nhistory.” He clambered up a step and shuffled further, pointed excitedly to\nthe floor, voice shrill with excitement.\n“It was on this precise spot, as I remember it, that Calica stood to\naddress the senate, urging caution in the Empire’s eastern expansion. It was\ndown there that Juvens replied to him, arguing boldness, and carried the\nday. I watched them, spellbound. Twenty years old, and breathless with\nexcitement. I still recall their arguments, in every detail. Words, my friends.\nThere can be a greater power in words than in all the steel within the Circle\nof the World.”\n“A blade in your ear still hurts more than a word in it, though,”\nwhispered Logen. Jezal spluttered with laughter, but Bayaz did not seem to\nnotice. He was too busy hurrying from one stone bench to another.\n“Here Scarpius gave his exhortation on the dangers of decadence, on the\ntrue meaning of citizenship. The senate sat, entranced. His voice rang out\nlike… like…” Bayaz plucked at the air with his hand, as though hoping to\nfind the right word there. “Bah. What does it matter now? There are no\ncertainties left in the world. That was the age of great men, doing what was\nright.” He frowned down at the broken rubble choking the floor of the\ncolossal room. “This is the age of little men, doing what they must. Little\nmen, with little dreams, walking in giant footsteps. Still, you can see it was\na grand building once!”\n“Er, yes…” ventured Jezal, limping away from the others to peer at\nsome friezes carved into the wall at the very back of the seating. Half-naked\nwarriors, awkwardly posed, pushing at each other with spears. All grand, no\ndoubt, but there was an unpleasant smell to the place. Like rot, like damp,\nlike sweating animals. The odour of badly cleaned stables. He peered into\nthe shadows, wrinkling his nose. “What is that smell?”\nNinefingers sniffed the air, and his face fell in an instant. A picture of\nwide-eyed horror. “By the…” He ripped his sword out, taking a step\nforward. Jezal turned, fumbling for the grips of his steels, a sudden fear\npressing on his chest…\nHe took it at first for some manner of beggar: a dark shape, swathed in\nrags, squatting on all fours in the darkness only a few paces away. Then he\nsaw the hands: twisted and clawlike on the pitted stone. Then he saw the\ngrey face, if you could call it a face: a chunk of hairless brow, a lumpen jaw\nbursting with outsize teeth, a flat snout like a pig’s, tiny black eyes glinting"

Something between a man and an animal,\nand more hideous by far than either. Jezal’s jaw dropped open, and he stood\ngawping. It scarcely seemed worth telling Ninefingers that he now believed\nhim.\nIt was clear there were such things as Shanka in the world.\n“Get it!” roared the Northman, scrambling up the steps of the great\nchamber, drawn sword in hand. “Kill it!”\nJezal shambled uncertainly towards the thing, but his leg was still\nhalfway to useless, and the creature was quick as a fox, turning and\nskittering across the cold stone towards a crack in the curving wall and\nwriggling through like a cat through a fence before he had got more than a\nfew lurching steps.\n“It’s gone!”\nBayaz was already shuffling towards the entrance, the tapping of his\nstaff on the marble echoing above them. “We see that, Master Luthar. We all\nvery clearly see that!”\n“There’ll be more,” hissed Logen, “there’re always more! We have to\ngo!”\nIt had been bad luck, Jezal thought as he lurched back towards the\nentrance, stumbling down the broken steps and wincing at the pain in his\nknee. Bad luck that Bayaz had decided to stop, right here and now. Bad luck\nthat Jezal’s leg had been broken and he couldn’t run after that repulsive\nthing. Bad luck that they had come to Aulcus, instead of being able to cross\nthe river miles downstream.\n“How did they get here?” Logen was shouting at Bayaz.\n“I can only guess,” grunted the Magus, wincing and breathing hard.\n“After the Maker’s death we hunted them. We drove them into the dark\ncorners of the world.”\n“There are few corners darker than this one.” Longfoot hurried past\nthem for the entrance and down the steps, two at a time, and Jezal hopped\nafter him.\n“What is it?” called Ferro, pulling her bow off her shoulder.\n“Flatheads!” roared Ninefingers.\nShe gazed at him blankly and the Northman flapped his free hand at her.\n“Just fucking ride!”\nBad luck. That Jezal had beaten Bremer dan Gorst and been chosen by\nBayaz for this mad journey. Bad luck that he had ever held a fencing steel.\nBad luck that his father had wanted him to join the army instead of doing\nnothing with his life like his two brothers. Strange how that had always\nseemed like good luck at the time. Sometimes it was hard to tell the\ndifference.\nJezal stumbled up to his horse, grabbed the saddlebow, and dragged\nhimself clumsily up. Longfoot and Ninefingers were already in their\nsaddles. Bayaz was just shoving his staff back into its place with trembling\nhands. Somewhere in the city behind them, a bell began to clang.\n“Oh dear,” said Longfoot, peering wide-eyed through the multitude of\nstatues. “Oh dear.”\n“Bad luck,” whispered Jezal."

Luck was a word idiots used to explain\nthe consequences of their own rashness, and selfishness, and stupidity. More\noften than not, bad luck meant bad plans.\nAnd here was the proof.\nShe had warned Bayaz that there was something in the city besides her\nand five pink fools. She had warned him, but no one had listened. People\nonly believe what they want to. Idiots, anyway.\nShe watched the others while she rode. Quai, on the seat of the jolting\ncart, eyes narrowed and fixed ahead. Luthar, with his lips curled back from\nhis teeth, pressed into the saddle in the crouch of a practised rider. Bayaz,\njaw clenched tight, face pale and drawn, clinging on grimly. Longfoot,\nlooking often over his shoulder, eyes wide with fear and alarm. Ninefingers,\njolting in his saddle, breathing hard, spending more time looking at his reins\nthan at the road. Five idiots, and her.\nShe heard a growl and saw a creature squatting on a low roof. It was like\nnothing she had seen before—a bent-over ape, twisted and long-limbed.\nApes do not throw spears, however. Her eyes followed it as it arced\ndownwards. It thudded into the side of the cart and stuck there, wobbling,\nthen they were past and clattering on down the rutted street.\nThat one might have missed, but there were more creatures in the ruins\nahead. Ferro could see them moving in the shadowy buildings. Scuttling\nalong the roofs, lurking in the crumbling windows, the gaping doorways.\nShe was tempted to try a shaft at one of them, but what would have been the\npoint? There were a lot of them out there. Hundreds, it felt like. What good\nwould killing one of them do, when they were soon left behind? A waste of\nan arrow.\nA rock crashed down suddenly beside her and she felt a fragment from it\nwhiz past and nick the back of her hand. It left a bead of dark blood on her\nskin. Ferro frowned and put her head down, keeping herself low to the\nbouncing back of her horse. There was no such thing as luck.\nBut there was no point being a bigger target.\nL\nogen thought he’d left the Shanka far behind, but after the first shock of\nseeing one, it came as no surprise. He should’ve known by now. Only\nfriends get left behind. Enemies are always at your heels.\nThe bells were all around them, echoing out of the ruins. Logen’s skull\nwas full of their clashing, stabbing through the cracking hooves and the\nshrieking wheels and the rushing air. Clanging far away, near at hand,\nahead, and behind. The buildings rushed by, grey shapes full of danger.\nHe saw something flash by and bounce spinning from the stones. A\nspear.

He swallowed, narrowing his eyes against the wind in his face, and\ntried not to imagine a spear thudding into his back. It wasn’t too difficult.\nJust holding on was taking all his concentration.\nFerro had turned in her saddle to shout something at him over her\nshoulder, but her words were lost in the noise. He shook his head at her and\nshe stabbed her arm furiously at the road ahead. Now he saw it. A crevasse\nopened in the road before them, rushing up at a gallop. Logen’s mouth\ngaped just as wide and he gave a breathless squeak of horror.\nHe dragged on the reins, and his horse’s hooves slipped and skittered on\nthe old stones, turning sharply to the right. The saddle lurched and Logen\nclung on, cobbles flying by underneath in a grey blur, the edge of the great\nchasm rushing past, no more than a few strides away on his left, cracks\nfrom it cutting out into the crumbling road. He could feel the others nearby,\ncould hear voices shouting, but he couldn’t hear their words. He was too\nbusy rolling and bouncing painfully in the saddle, willing himself to stay\non, all the while whispering.\n“Still alive, still alive, still alive…”\nA temple loomed up towards them, straddling the road, its towering\npillars still intact, a monstrous triangular weight of stone still standing on\ntop. The cart crashed between two of the columns, and Logen’s horse found\nits way between two others, dipping suddenly into shadow and back out, all\nof them surging into a wide hall open to the sky. The crack had swallowed\nthe wall to the left, and if there had ever been a roof, it had vanished long\nago. Logen rode on, breathless, eyes fixed on a wide archway straight\nahead, a square of brightness in the dark stone, bouncing and jolting with\nthe movement of his horse. That was safety, Logen told himself. If they\ncould get through there, they were away. If they could only get through\nthere…\nHe didn’t see the spear coming, but if he had, there would’ve been\nnothing he could’ve done. It was lucky, in a way, that it missed his leg. It\nthudded deep into horseflesh just in front of it. That was less lucky. He\nheard the horse snort as its legs buckled, as he came free of the saddle,\nmouth dropping open and no sound coming out, the floor of the hall\nflashing up to meet him. Hard stone crunched into his chest and snatched\nhis wind away. His jaw smacked against the ground and his head flooded\nwith blinding light. He bounced once, then flopped over and over, the world\nspinning crazily around him, full of strange sound and blinding sky. He slid\nto a stop on his side.\nHe lay in a daze, groaning softly, his head reeling, his ears ringing, not\nknowing where he was or even who. Then the world came suddenly back\ntogether.\nHe jerked his head up. The chasm was no more than a spear’s length\nfrom him, he could hear the water rushing far away in its bottom. He rolled"

He rolled\nover, away from his horse, trickles of dark blood working their way along\nthe grooves in the stones underneath it. He saw Ferro, down on one knee,\npulling arrows from her quiver and shooting them towards the pillars they\nhad ridden between a few moments before.\nThere were Shanka there, a lot of them.\n“Shit,” grunted Logen, scrambling back, the heels of his boots scraping\nat the dusty stones.\n“Come on!” shouted Luthar, sliding down from his saddle, half hopping\nacross the dusty floor. “Come on!”\nA Flathead charged towards them, shrieking, a great axe in its hand. It\nleaped up suddenly and turned over in the air, one of Ferro’s arrows stuck\nthrough its face. But there were others. There were a lot more creeping\naround the pillars, spears ready to throw.\n“Too many!” shouted Bayaz. The old man frowned up at the great\ncolumns, the huge weight of stone above them, the muscles of his jaw\nclenching tight. The air around him began to shimmer.\n“Shit.” Logen stumbled like a drunkard across to Ferro, his balance all\ngone, the hall tipping back and forth around him, the sound of his own heart\npounding in his ears. He heard a sharp bang and a crack shot up one of the\npillars, a cloud of dust flying out from it. There was a grinding rumble as\nthe stone above began to shift. A couple of the Shanka looked up as\nfragments rained down on them, pointing and gibbering.\nLogen grabbed tight hold of Ferro’s wrist. “Fuck!” she hissed, fumbling\nan arrow as he half fell and dragged her over, scrambled up, and started to\npull her after him. A spear zipped past them and clattered across the stones,\ntumbled off over the edge of the crack into empty space. He could hear the\nShanka moving, grunting and growling to each other, starting to swarm\nbetween the pillars and into the hall.\n“Come on!” shouted Luthar again, taking a couple of limping steps\nforward and beckoning wildly.\nLogen saw Bayaz standing, his lips curled back and his eyes bulging\nfrom his skull, the air around him rippling and twisting, the dust on the\nground lifting slowly and curling up around his boots. There was an\nalmighty crack, and Logen looked over his shoulder to see a great lump of\ncarved stone plummet down from above. It hit the ground with a crash that\nmade the floor shake, crushing an unlucky Shanka to flat nothing before it\ncould even scream, a jagged sword clattering across the ground and a long\nspatter of dark blood the only signs that it had ever existed. But more were\ncoming, he could see the black shapes of them through the flying dust,\ncharging forward, weapons held high.\nOne of the pillars split in half. It buckled, moving with ludicrous\nslowness, pieces of it flying forward into the hall. The vast mass of stone\nabove began to crack apart, tumbling downwards in chunks as big as\nhouses.

Logen turned and flung himself on his face and dragged Ferro down\nwith him, grovelling on the ground, squeezing his eyes shut, throwing his\nhands over his head.\nThere was a giant crashing, tearing, splitting such as Logen had never\nheard in all his life. A roaring and groaning of tortured earth as though the\nworld was falling in. Perhaps it was. The ground bucked and trembled\nunderneath him. There was another deafening crash, a long clattering and\nscraping, a gentle clicking, then something close to quiet.\nLogen unclenched his aching jaw and opened his eyes. The air was full\nof stinging dust, but it felt as if he was lying on some kind of slope. He\ncoughed and tried to move. There was a sharp grinding sound beneath his\nchest and the stone underneath him began to shift, the slope getting steeper.\nHe gasped and pressed himself back flat against it, clinging to it with his\nfingertips. He still had his hand clenched round Ferro’s arm, and he felt her\nfingers squeeze tight into his wrist. He turned his head slowly to look\naround him, and froze.\nThe pillars were gone. The hall was gone. The floor was gone. The vast\ncrack had swallowed them all up, and now yawned underneath him. Angry\nwater slapped and hissed at the shattered ruins far below. Logen gaped,\nhardly able to believe his eyes. He was lying sideways on a huge slab of\nstone, until a moment ago part of the floor of the hall, now teetering at an\nangle on the very edge of a plunging cliff.\nFerro’s dark fingers were clamped round his wrist, her ripped sleeve\ngathered up round her elbow, sinews standing out stark from her brown\nforearm with the effort. Beyond that he could see her shoulder, beyond that\nher rigid face. The rest of her was invisible—dangling over the edge of the\nslab and into the yawning air.\n“Ssss,” she hissed, yellow eyes wide, fingers scrabbling desperately for a\nhandhold on the smooth slope. A chunk of stone cracked suddenly from the\nragged edge and Logen heard it fall, pinging and bouncing from the\nruptured earth.\n“Shit,” he whispered, hardly daring even to breathe. What the hell were\nthe chances of this? Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say that he has\npoor luck.\nHe crawled his free hand up the pitted stone until he found a shallow\nridge to cling to. He lifted himself inch by inch towards the edge of the\nblock above. He flexed his arm and started to drag at Ferro’s wrist.\nThere was a horrifying scraping and the stone underneath him jolted and\ntipped slowly upwards. He whimpered and pressed himself back against it,\nwilling it to stop. There was a sickening jolt and some dust filtered down\ninto his face. Stone squealed as the block swung ever so slowly back the\nother way. He lay there, gasping. No way up, no way down.\n“Ssss!” Ferro’s eyes flicked to their hands, gripped tight round each\nother’s wrists. She jerked her head up towards the edge of the block, then\ndown towards the gaping crack behind."

She jerked her head up towards the edge of the block, then\ndown towards the gaping crack behind.\n“Have to be realistic,” she whispered. Her fingers uncurled, letting him\ngo.\nLogen remembered hanging from a building, far above a circle of\nyellow grass. He remembered sliding back, whispering for help. He\nremembered Ferro’s hand closing round his, pulling him up. He slowly\nshook his head, and gripped her wrist tighter than ever.\nShe rolled her yellow eyes at him. “Stupid fucking pink!”\nJ\nezal coughed, turned over, and spat out dust. He blinked around him.\nSomething was different. It seemed much brighter than it had been, and the\nedge of the crack was much nearer. Not far away at all, in fact.\n“Uh,” he breathed, words failing him. Half the building had collapsed.\nThe rear wall was still standing, and one of the pillars at the far end, broken\noff halfway up. All the rest was gone, vanished into the yawning chasm. He\nstaggered up, wincing as his weight went onto his bad leg. He saw Bayaz\nlying propped against the wall nearby.\nThe Magus’s withered face was streaked with sweat, bright eyes\nglittering in black circles, bones of his face poking through stretched skin.\nHe looked like nothing so much as a week-old corpse. It was a surprise to\nsee him move at all, but Jezal watched him raise one palsied hand to point\ntowards the crack. “Get them,” he croaked.\nThe others.\n“Over here!” Ninefingers’ voice came strangled-sounding from beyond\nthe edge of the crevasse. So he was alive, at least. One great slab was\nsticking up at an angle and Jezal shuffled gingerly towards it, worried that\nthe floor might suddenly give way beneath him. He peered over into the\nchasm.\nThe Northman was lying spread out on his front, left hand up near the\ntop edge of the tilting block, right fist near the bottom clutched tight round\nFerro’s wrist. Her body was out of sight, her scarred face just visible. They\nboth looked equally horrified. Several tons of stone, rocking, ever so gently,\nbalanced on the finest of margins. It was plain that it might easily slide into\nthe abyss at any moment.\n“Do something…” whispered Ferro, not even daring to raise her voice.\nJezal noticed that she did not suggest any specifics, however.\nHe licked at the slot in his lip. Perhaps if he were to put his weight on\nthis end it would tilt back level and they could simply crawl off? Could it\npossibly be so straightforward? He reached out carefully, thumbs rubbing\nnervously against fingertips, all suddenly weak and sweaty-feeling. He laid\nhis hand gently on the ragged edge while Ninefingers and Ferro stared,\nholding their breath.\nHe applied the very slightest pressure, and the slab began to swing\nsmoothly downwards. He put a little more weight on it. There was a loud\ngrating sound and the whole block gave a horrifying lurch.\n“Don’t fucking push it!” screamed Ninefingers, clinging to the smooth\nrock with his fingernails."

Of Longfoot and Quai\nthere was no sign. Either they were dead somewhere at the bottom of the\nchasm or they had made a timely bid for freedom. Neither one would have\nmuch surprised him. If anyone was going to be saved, Jezal would have to\ndo it by himself.\nHe dragged his coat off, started to twist it round to make a kind of rope.\nHe weighed it in his hand, shaking his head. Surely this would never work,\nbut what were the choices? He stretched it out, then swung one end over. It\nslapped against the stone a few inches short of Logen’s clutching fingers,\nsending up a puff of grit.\n“Alright, alright, try again!”\nJezal lifted the coat up high, leaning out over the slab as far as he dared,\nand swung it down again. The arm flopped out just far enough for Logen to\nseize hold of.\n“Yes!” He wound it round his wrist, the material dragging out tight over\nthe edge of the slab.\n“Yes! Now pull it!”\nJezal gritted his teeth and hauled, his boots slipping in the dust, his sore\narm and his sore leg aching with the effort. The coat came towards him,\nslowly, slowly, sliding over the stone, inch by torturous inch.\n“Yes!” grunted Ninefingers, working his shoulders up the slab.\n“Pull it!” growled Ferro, wriggling her hips up over the edge and onto\nthe slope.\nJezal hauled for all he was worth, eyes squeezed almost shut, breath\nhissing between his teeth. A spear clattered down beside him and he looked\nup to see a score or more Flatheads gathered on the far side of the great\ncrack, waving their misshapen arms. He swallowed and looked away from\nthem. He could not allow himself to think of the danger. All that mattered\nwas to pull. To pull and pull and not let go, however much it hurt. And it\nwas working. Slowly, slowly, they were coming up. Jezal dan Luthar, the\nhero at last. He would finally have earned his place on this cursed\nexpedition.\nThere was a sharp ripping sound. “Shit,” squeaked Logen. “Shit!” The\nsleeve was coming slowly away from the body of the coat, the stitches\nstretching, ripping, coming undone. Jezal whimpered with horror, his hands\nburning. Should he pull or not? Another stitch pinged open. How hard to\npull? One more stitch went.\n“What do I do?” he squealed.\n“Pull, you fucker!”\nJezal dragged at the coat as hard as he could, muscles burning. Ferro\nwas up on the stone, scrabbling at the smooth surface with her nails.\nLogen’s clutching hand was almost at the edge, almost there, his three\nfingers stretching, stretching out for it.

There was a squawk, and Logen slid\naway, the ripped-off sleeve flapping useless in his hand. There were no\nscreams. Just a clatter of tumbling stones, then nothing. They both were\ngone, over the edge. The great slab rocked slowly back and lay there, flat\nand empty, at the edge of the crack. Jezal stood and stared, his mouth open,\nthe sleeveless coat still dangling from his throbbing hand.\n“No,” he whispered. That was not how it happened in the stories.\nBeneath the Ruins\nY\nou alive, pink?”\nLogen groaned as he shifted his weight, felt a lurch of horror as stones\nmoved underneath him. Then he realised he was lying in a heap of rubble,\nthe corner of a slab digging hard into a sore spot in his back. He saw a stone\nwall, blurry, a hard line across it between light and shadow. He blinked,\nwincing, pain creeping up his arm as he tried to rub the dust out of his eyes.\nFerro was kneeling just beside him, her dark face streaked with blood\nfrom a cut on her forehead, her black hair full of brown dust. Behind her a\nwide vaulted chamber stretched into the shadows. The ceiling was broken\naway above her head, a ragged line with the pale-blue sky beyond it. Logen\nturned his head painfully, baffled. No more than a stride from him the stone\nslabs he was lying on were sheared off, jutting out into the empty air. A long\nway away he could see the far side of the crack, a cliff of crumbling rock\nand earth, the outlines of half-fallen buildings jutting from the top.\nHe began to understand. They were underneath the floor of the temple.\nWhen the crack opened up it must have torn this place open, leaving just\nenough of a ledge for them to fall onto. Them and a lot of broken rock.\nThey couldn’t have fallen far. He almost felt himself grinning. He was still\nalive.\n“What ab—”\nFerro’s hand slapped down hard over his mouth, her nose not a foot\nfrom his. “Ssss,” she hissed softly, yellow eyes rolling upward, one long\nfinger pointing towards the vaulted ceiling.\nLogen felt his skin go prickling cold. He heard them now. Shanka.\nScuffling and clattering, gibbering and squeaking to each other, up above\ntheir heads. He nodded, and slowly Ferro lifted her dirty hand away from\nhis face.\nHe eased himself up out of the rubble, slow and stiff, trying to stay as\nquiet as possible, wincing all the while at the effort, dust running off his\ncoat as he came up to his feet. He tested his limbs, waiting for the searing\npain that would tell him he had broken his shoulder, or his leg, or his skull.\nHis coat was ripped and his elbow was skinned and throbbing, streaks of\nblood all down his forearm to his fingertips. When he put his fingers to his\naching head, he felt blood there, and underneath his jaw, where he cracked"

His mouth was salty with it. Must have bitten his tongue,\nyet again. It was a wonder the damn thing was still attached. One knee was\npainful, his neck was stiff, his ribs were a mass of bruises, but everything\nstill moved. If he forced it to.\nThere was something wrapped round his hand. The torn sleeve of\nLuthar’s coat. He shook it off and let it drop in the rubble beside him. No\nuse now. Not much use then. Ferro was at the far end of the hall, peering\ninto an archway. Logen shambled up beside her, doing his grimacing best to\nkeep silent.\n“What about the others?” he whispered. Ferro shrugged her shoulders.\n“Maybe they got away?” he tried, hopefully. Ferro gave him a long, slow\nlook, one black eyebrow raised, and Logen winced and squeezed his aching\narm. She was right. The two of them were alive, for now. That was about as\nmuch luck as they could hope for, and it might be a while before they got\nany more.\n“This way,” whispered Ferro, pointing into the darkness.\nLogen peered into that black opening and his heart sank. He hated being\nunderground. All that weight of stone and earth, pressing above, ready to\nfall. And they had no torch. Inky black, with hardly air to breathe, no notion\nof how far to go, or in what direction. He peered up nervously towards the\nvaulted stones above his head, and swallowed. Tunnels were places for\nShanka or for the dead. Logen was neither one, and he didn’t much fancy\nmeeting either down there. “You sure?”\n“What, scared of the dark?”\n“I’d rather be able to see, if I had the choice.”\n“You see any choices?” sneered Ferro at him. “You can stay here, if you\nwant. Maybe another pack of idiots will come wandering through in a\nhundred years. You’ll fit right in!”\nLogen nodded, sucking sourly at his bloody gums. It seemed like a long\ntime since the two of them had last been in a fix like this one, sliding across\nthe dizzy rooftops of the Agriont, hunted by men in black masks. It seemed\na long, hard time, but nothing much had changed. For all their riding\ntogether, and eating together, and facing death together, Ferro was still as\nbitter, and as angry, and as sore a pain in his arse as she had been when they\nfirst set out. He tried to be patient, really he did, but it was getting to be\ntiring.\n“Do you have to?” he muttered, looking her right in one yellow eye.\n“Have to what?”\n“Be a cunt. Do you have to?”\nShe frowned at him for a moment, opened her mouth, paused, then\nshrugged her shoulders. “You should have let me fall.”\n“Eh?” He’d been expecting some furious insult from her. Some stabbing\nat him with a finger, certainly, and possibly with a blade. That had sounded\nalmost like regret. But if it had been, it didn’t last long."

There was no helping some people. “Let go\nof you? Don’t worry! Next time I will!”\n“Good!” spat Ferro, stalking off into the tunnel, shadows quickly\nswallowing her. Logen felt a sudden stab of panic at the idea of being left\nalone.\n“Wait!” he hissed, and hurried after.\nThe passageway sloped downwards, Ferro’s feet padding noiseless,\nLogen’s scraping in the dust, the last shreds of light gleaming on wet stone.\nHe kept the fingertips of his left hand trailing along the wall, trying not to\ngroan with each step at the pain in his bruised ribs, and his torn elbow, and\nhis bloody jaw.\nIt grew darker, and darker yet. The walls and the floor became nothing\nbut hints, then nothing at all. Ferro’s dirty shirt was a grey ghost, hovering\nin the dead air before him. A few weak-kneed steps further and it was gone.\nHe waved his hand in front of his face. Not so much as a trace. Just inky,\nfizzing blackness.\nHe was buried. Buried in the darkness, alone. “Ferro, wait!”\n“What?” He blundered into her in the dark, felt something shove him in\nthe chest, and nearly fell over backwards, staggering against the damp wall.\n“What the hell—”\n“I can’t see anything!” he hissed, hearing his own voice full of panic. “I\ncan’t… where are you?” He flailed at the air with his open hands, all sense\nof direction gone, his heart pounding, his stomach sick and heaving. What if\nshe’d left him down there, the evil bitch? What if—\n“Here.” He felt her hand catch hold of his and close round it, cool and\nreassuring. He heard her voice not far from his ear. “You think you can\nfollow me without falling on your face, fool?”\n“I… I think so.”\n“Just try to keep quiet!” And he felt her move off, pulling him\nimpatiently after her.\nIf only the old crew could’ve seen him now.

An unpleasant sensation,\nhis sticky skin pressed tight against hers. Sickening, almost, but Ferro made\nherself hold on.

One more pink that she\nwould have to keep her eye on. Ugly and strange, stupid and dangerous.\nBack then, he might easily have been the last man in the world she would\nhave trusted. Now he might easily have been the only one. He had not let\nher fall, even though she had told him to. He had chosen to fall with her\nrather than let her go. Out there on the plain, he had said he would stick if\nshe did.\nNow he had proved it.\nShe looked over her shoulder, saw his pale face gawping in the dark,\neyes wide but unseeing, free hand stretched out and feeling for the walls.\nShe should have thanked him, maybe, for not letting her fall, but that would\nhave been as good as admitting she needed the help. Help was for the weak,\nand the weak die, or are made slaves. Never hope for help and you can\nnever be disappointed when it does not come. And Ferro had been\ndisappointed often.\nSo instead of thanking him she dragged at his hand and nearly made him\nfall.\nA glimmer of cold light was starting to creep back into the tunnel, the\nslightest glow at the edges of the rough stone blocks. “Can you see now?”\nshe hissed over her shoulder.\n“Yes.” She could hear the relief in his voice.\n“Then you can let go,” she snapped, snatching her hand away and\nwiping it on the front of her shirt. She pressed on through the half-light,\nworking her fingers and frowning down at them. It was an odd feeling.\nNow that his hand was gone she almost missed it.\nThe light was growing brighter now, leaking into the passage from a\nnarrow archway up ahead. She crept towards it, padding on the balls of her\nfeet, and peered round the corner. A great cavern opened out below them, its\nwalls partly of smooth carved blocks, partly of natural stone, soaring up and\nbulging out in strange, melted formations, its ceiling lost in shadows. A\nshaft of light came down from high above, casting a long patch of\nbrightness on the dusty stone floor. Three Shanka were gathered there in a\nclump, muttering and scratching over something on the floor, and all around\nthem, piled in great heaps, as high as a man and higher to the very walls of\nthe cave, were thousands, upon thousands, upon thousands of bones.\n“Shit,” breathed Logen from just behind her. A skull grinned up at them\nfrom the corner of the arch. Human bones, without a doubt.\n“They eat the dead,” she whispered.\n“They what? But—”\n“Nothing rots.” Bayaz had said the city was full of graves. Countless\ncorpses, flung in pits for a hundred each. And there they must have lain\ndown the long years, tangled up together in a cold embrace.\nUntil the Shanka came and dragged them out.\n“We’ll have to get around them,” whispered Ninefingers.\nFerro stared into the shadows, looking for a route into the cavern. There\nwas no way to climb down that hill of bones without making noise. She\nshrugged her bow off her shoulder.\n“You sure?” asked Ninefingers, touching her on the elbow."

She\nshrugged her bow off her shoulder.\n“You sure?” asked Ninefingers, touching her on the elbow.\nShe nudged him back. “Give me some room, pink.” She would have to\nwork quickly. She wiped the blood out of her eyebrow. She slid three\narrows out of her quiver and between the fingers of her right hand, where\nshe could get at them fast. She took a fourth in her left and levelled her\nbow, drawing back the string, aiming at the furthest Flathead. When the\narrow struck it through the body she was already aiming at the second. It\ntook the shaft in the shoulder and fell down with a strange squawk just as\nthe last one was turning. Her arrow caught it clean through its neck before it\ngot all the way round, and it pitched on its face. Ferro nocked the last arrow,\nwaiting. The second Flathead tried to scramble up, but it had not got half a\nstride before she nailed it through the back and sent it sprawling.\nShe lowered the bow, frowning towards the Shanka. None of them\nmoved.\n“Shit,” breathed Logen. “Bayaz is right. You are a devil.”\n“Was right,” grunted Ferro. The chances were good that those creatures\nhad him by now, and it was abundantly clear that they ate men. Luthar, and\nLongfoot, and Quai as well, she guessed. A shame.\nBut not a big one.\nShe shouldered her bow and crept cautiously into the cavern, keeping\nlow, her boot crunching down in the hill of bones. She wobbled out further,\narms spread wide for balance, half walking, half wading, up to her knees in\nplaces, bones cracking and scraping around her legs. She made it down onto\nthe cavern floor and knelt there, staring round and licking her lips.\nNothing moved. The three Shanka lay still, dark blood pooling on the\nstone underneath their bodies.\n“Gah!” Ninefingers tumbled down the slope, clattering splinters flying\nup around him, rolling over and over. He crashed down on his face in the\nmidst of a rattling slide of bones, and scrambled up. “Shit! Ugh!” He shook\nhalf a dusty rib cage off his arm and flung it away.\n“Quiet, fool!” hissed Ferro, dragging him down beside her, staring\nacross the cavern towards a rough archway in the far wall, expecting hordes\nof those things to come pouring in at any moment, keen to add their bones\nto the rest. But nothing came. She gave him a dark look, but he was too\nbusy nursing his bruises, so she left him be and crept over to the three\ncorpses.\nThey had been gathered round a leg. A woman’s leg, Ferro guessed,\nfrom the lack of hair on it. A stub of bone poked out of dry, withered flesh\nround the severed thigh. One of them had been going at it with a knife and\nit still lay nearby, the bright blade shining in the shaft of light from high\nabove. Ninefingers stooped and picked it up.\n“You can never have too many knives.”\n“No? What if you fall in a river and can’t swim for all that iron?”\nHe looked puzzled for a moment, then he shrugged and put it carefully"

What if you fall in a river and can’t swim for all that iron?”\nHe looked puzzled for a moment, then he shrugged and put it carefully\nback down on the ground. “Fair point.”\nShe slipped her own blade out from her belt. “One knife will do well\nenough. If you know where to stick it.” She dug the blade into one of the\nFlatheads’ backs and started to cut out her arrow. “What are these things\nanyway?” She worked the shaft out, intact, and rolled the Flathead over\nwith her boot. It stared up at her, piggy black eyes unseeing under a low, flat\nforehead, lips curled back from a wide maw full of bloody teeth. “They’re\neven uglier than you, pink.”\n“Very good. They’re Shanka. Flatheads. Kanedias made them.”\n“Made them?” The next arrow snapped off as she tried to twist it out.\n“So Bayaz said. As a weapon, to use in a war.”\n“I thought he died.”\n“Seems his weapons lived on.”\nThe one she shot through the neck had fallen on the shaft and broken it\nnear the head. Useless, now. “How does a man make one of these things?”\n“You think I’ve got the answers? They’d come across the sea, every\nsummer, when the ice melted, and there’d always be work fighting ’em.\nLots of work.” She hacked out the last shaft, bloody but sound. “When I\nwas young they started coming more and more often. My father sent me\nsouth, over the mountains, to get help with the fighting of ’em…” He trailed\noff. “Well. That’s a long story. The High Valleys are swarming with\nFlatheads now.”\n“It hardly matters,” she grunted, standing up and sliding the two good\narrows carefully back into her quiver, “as long as they die.”\n“Oh, they die. Trouble is there’s always more to kill.” He was frowning\ndown at the three dead things, frowning down hard with a cold look in his\neye. “There’s nothing left now, north of the mountains. Nothing and no\none.”\nFerro did not much care about that. “We need to move.”\n“All back to the mud,” he growled, as though she had not spoken, his\nfrown growing harder all the time.\nShe stepped up in front of his face. “You hear me? We need to move, I\nsaid.”\n“Eh?” He blinked at her for a moment, then he scowled. The muscles\nround his jaw tightened rigid under his skin, the scars stretching and\nshifting, face tipped forward, eyes lost in hard shadow from the light\noverhead. “Alright. We move.”\nFerro frowned at him as a trickle of blood crept down from his hair and\nacross the greasy, stubbly side of his face. He no longer looked like anyone\nshe would trust.\n“Not planning to go strange on me, are you, pink? I need you to stay\ncold.”\n“I am cold,” he whispered.\nL\nogen was hot. His skin prickled under his dirty clothes. He felt strange,\ndizzy, his head full of the stink of Shanka. He could hardly breathe for their\nsmell. The hallway seemed to move under his feet, shifting before his eyes."

The hallway\nwas growing hotter and hotter, the blurry stone had taken on an orange\nglow. He blundered into Ferro’s back and nearly fell, crawled forward on\nhis sore knees, gasping hard.\nThere was a huge cavern beyond. Four slender columns rose up in the\ncentre, up and up into the shifting darkness far above. Beneath them fires\nburned. Many fires, printing white images into Logen’s stinging eyes. Coals\ncrackled and cracked and spat out smoke. Sparks came up in stinging\nshowers, steam came up in hissing gouts. Globs of melted iron dripped\nfrom crucibles, spattering the ground with glowing embers. Molten metal\nran through channels in the floor, striking lines of red and yellow and\nsearing white into the black stone.\nThe yawning space was full of Shanka, ragged shapes moving through\nthe boiling darkness. They worked at the fires, and the bellows, and the\ncrucibles like men, a score of them or more. There was a furious din.\nHammers clanged, anvils rang, metal clattered, Flatheads squawked and\nshrieked to each other. Racks stood against the distant walls, dark racks\nstacked with bright weapons, steel glittering in all the colours of fire and\nfury.\nLogen blinked and stared, head pounding, arm throbbing, the heat\npressing onto his face, wondering if he could believe his eyes. Perhaps they\nhad walked into the forge of hell. Perhaps Glustrod had opened a gate\nbeneath the city after all. A gate to the Other Side, and they had passed\nthrough it without ever guessing.\nHe was breathing fast, in ragged gasps, and couldn’t make them slow,\nand every breath he took was full of the sting of smoke and the stink of\nShanka. His eyes were bulging, his throat was burning, he could not\nswallow. He wasn’t sure when he had drawn the Maker’s sword, but now\nthe orange light flashed and flickered on the bare dark metal, his right hand\nbunched into a fist around the grip, painful tight. He couldn’t make the\nfingers open. He stared at them, glowing orange and black, pulsing as if\nthey were on fire, veins and tendons starting from the taut skin, knuckles\npale with furious pressure.\nNot his hand.\n“We’ll have to go back,” Ferro was saying, pulling at his arm, “find\nanother way.”\n“No.” The voice was harsh as a hammer falling, rough as a whetstone\nturning, sharp as a drawn blade in his throat.\nNot his voice.\n“Get behind me,” he managed to whisper, grabbing hold of Ferro’s\nshoulder and dragging himself past her.\nThere could be no going back now…\n… and he could smell them.

His head was full of the reek of them and that was good.\nHatred was a powerful weapon, in the right hands. The Bloody-Nine hated\neverything. But his oldest buried, and his deepest rooted, and his hottest\nburning hatred, that was for the Shanka.\nHe slid into the cavern, a shadow between the fires, the noise of angry\nsteel echoing around him. A beautiful and familiar song. He swam in it,\nrevelled in it, drank it in. He felt the heavy blade in his hand, power flowing\nfrom the cold metal into his hot flesh, from his hot flesh into the cold metal,\nbuilding and swelling and growing in waves with his surging breath.\nThe Flatheads had not seen him yet. They were working. Busy with their\nmeaningless tasks. They could not have expected vengeance to find them\nwhere they lived, and breathed, and toiled, but they would learn.\nThe Bloody-Nine loomed up behind one, lifting the Maker’s sword high.\nHe smiled as he watched the long shadow stretch out across the bald skull\n—a promise, soon to be fulfilled. The long blade whispered its secret and\nthe Shanka split apart, clean down the middle like a flower opening, blood\nspraying out warm and comforting, spattering the anvil, and the stone floor,\nand the Bloody-Nine’s face with wet little gifts.\nAnother saw him now and he came for it, faster and angrier than the\nboiling steam. It lifted an arm, lurching backwards. Not nearly far enough.\nThe Maker’s sword sheared through its elbow, the severed forearm spinning\nover and over in the air. Before it hit the ground, the Bloody-Nine had\nstruck the Shanka’s head off on the backswing. Blood sizzled on molten\niron, glowed orange on the dull metal of the blade, on the pale skin of his\nhand, on the harsh stone under his feet, and he beckoned to the others.\n“Come,” he whispered. They all were welcome.\nThey scattered for the racks, seizing their spiked swords, and their sharp\naxes, and the Bloody-Nine laughed to watch them. Armed or not, their\ndeath was a thing already decided. It was written into the cavern in lines of\nfire and lines of shadow. Now he would write it in lines of blood. They were\nanimals, and less than animals. Their weapons stabbed and cut at him, but\nthe Bloody-Nine was made of fire and darkness and he drifted and slithered\nbetween their crude blows, around their fumbling spears, under and over\ntheir worthless screams and their useless fury.\nEasier to stab the flickering flame. Easier to cut the shifting shadows.\nTheir weakness was an insult to his strength.\n“Die!” he roared, and the blade made circles, savage and beautiful, the\nletter on the metal burning red and leaving bright trails behind. And where\nthe circles passed, everything would be made right. The Shanka would\nscream and gibber, and the pieces of them would scatter, and they would be\nsliced and divided as neatly as meat on the butcher’s block, as dough on the\nbaker’s block, as the corn stubble left by the farmer’s scythe, all according"

He saw the flash of a blade and jerked away, felt it\nleave him a lingering kiss across his side. He knocked a barbed sword from\na Flathead’s hand, seized it by the scruff of the neck and forced its face\ndown into the channel where the molten steel flowed, furious yellow, and its\nhead hissed and bubbled, shooting out stinking steam.\n“Burn!” laughed the Bloody-Nine, and the ruined corpses, and their\ngaping wounds, and their fallen weapons, and the boiling-bright iron\nlaughed with him.\nOnly the Shanka did not laugh. They knew their hour was come.\nThe Bloody-Nine watched one jump, springing over an anvil, a club\nraised to crush his skull. Before he could slash it from the air, an arrow\nslipped into its open mouth and snatched it backwards, dead as mud. The\nBloody-Nine frowned. He saw other arrows now, among the corpses.\nSomeone else was spoiling his good work. He would make them pay, later,\nbut something was coming at him from between the four columns.\nIt was cased all in bright armour sealed with heavy rivets, a round\nhelmet clamped over the top half of its skull, eyes glinting beyond a thin\nslot. It grunted and snorted, sounds loud as a bull, iron-booted feet thudding\non the stone as it thundered forward, a massive axe in its iron-gloved fists.\nA giant among Shanka. Or some new thing, made from iron and flesh, down\nhere in the darkness.\nIts axe curved in a shining arc and the Bloody-Nine rolled away from it,\nthe heavy blade crashing into the ground and sending out a shower of\nfragments. It roared at him again, maw opening wide under its slotted visor,\na cloud of spit hissing from its hanging mouth. The Bloody-Nine faded\nback, shifting and dancing with the shifting shadows and the dancing\nflames.\nHe fell away, and away, and he let the blows miss him on one side and\nthe other, miss him above his head and beneath his feet. Let them clang into\nthe metal and the stone around him and fill the air with a fury of dust and\nsplinters. He fell back, until the creature began to tire under all that weight\nof iron.\nThe Bloody-Nine saw it stumble, and he felt the touch of his moment\nupon him, and he surged forward, raising the sword above his head,\nopening his mouth and making a scream that pressed on his arm, and his\nhand, and the blade and the very walls of the cavern. The great Shanka\nbrought the shaft of its axe up in both fists to block the blow. Good bright\nsteel, born in these hot fires, hard and strong and tough as the Flatheads\ncould forge it.\nBut the work of the Master Maker would not be denied.

They lurked there, three of them, weapons in\nhand, but they would not come on. They lurked in the shadows, but the\ndarkness was no friend to them. It belonged to him, and him alone. The\nBloody-Nine took a step forward, and one more, sword hanging from one\nhand, a length of bloody gut from the other, winding slowly from the\nslaughtered Flathead’s corpse. The creatures shuffled back before him,\nsqueaking and clicking to each other, and the Bloody-Nine laughed in their\nfaces.\nThe Shanka might be ever so full of mad fury, but even they had to fear\nhim. Everything did. Even the dead, who felt no pain. Even the cold stone,\nwhich did not dream. Even the molten iron feared the Bloody-Nine. Even\nthe darkness.\nHe roared and sprang forward, flinging his handful of entrails away. The\npoint of his sword raked across a Shanka’s chest and spun it round,\nsquealing. A moment later and the blade thudded into its shoulder and split\nit to its breastbone.\nThe last two turned to run, scrambling across the stone, but fight or run,\nwhere was the difference? Another arrow slid into the back of one before it\ngot three strides, and it sprawled on its face. The Bloody-Nine darted out\nand his fingers closed round the ankle of the last, tight as a vise, dragging it\ntowards him, its claws scrabbling at the soot-caked stone.\nHis fist was the hammer, the floor was the anvil, and the Shanka’s head\nwas the metal to be worked. One blow and its nose split open, broken teeth\nfalling. Two and he smashed its cheekbone in. Three and its jaw burst apart\nunder his knuckles. His fist was made of stone, of steel, of adamant. It was\nheavy as a falling mountain, and blow after blow it crushed the Shanka’s\nthick skull to formless mush.\n“Flat… head,” hissed the Bloody-Nine, and he laughed, hauling up the\nruined body and flinging it away, turning in the air, to crash down into the\nbroken racks. He reeled around, weaving across the chamber, the Maker’s\nsword dangling from his hand, the point striking sparks from the stone as it\nclattered after him. He glared into the darkness, turning and shifting, but\nonly the fires moved, and the shadows moving around them. The chamber\nwas empty.\n“No!” he snarled. “Where are you?” His legs were weak, they would\nhardly hold him up any longer. “Where are you, you fuckers…” He\nstumbled and fell on one knee on the hot stone, gasping in air.

Ferro\nknelt down beside it, peering into the dark tunnel it flowed out of.\n“If it joins the river downstream, it must come from outside the city.”\nLogen was not so sure. “What if it… comes up from… underground?”\n“Then we find another way. Or we drown.” Ferro shouldered her bow\nand slid in, up to her chest, her thin lips pressed tight together. Logen\nwatched her wade out, arms held up above the dark water. Did she never\ntire? He was so sore and weary he wanted only to lie down and never get\nup. For a moment he considered doing it. Then Ferro turned and saw him\nsquatting on the bank. “Come on, pink!” she hissed at him.\nLogen sighed. There was never any changing her mind. He heaved one\nreluctant, trembling leg into the cold water. “Right behind you,” he\nmuttered. “Right behind.”\nNo Good for Each Other\nF\nerro waded on against the current, up to her waist in fast-flowing water,\nteeth gritted against the gripping cold, Ninefingers sloshing and gasping\nbehind her. She could just see an archway up ahead, faint light from beyond\nglinting on the water. It was blocked with iron bars, but as she forced her\nway close, she could see they were rusted through, thin and flaking. She\npressed herself up against them. Beyond she could see the stream flowing\ndown towards her between banks of rock and bare mud. Above was the\nevening sky, stars just starting to show themselves.\nFreedom.\nFerro fumbled at the old iron, air hissing between her teeth, fingers slow\nand weak from the cold. Ninefingers came up beside her and planted his\nhands next to hers—four hands in a row, two dark and two pale, clamped\ntight and straining. They were pressed against each other in the narrow\nspace and she heard him grunting with effort, heard the rushing of her own\nbreath, felt the ancient metal beginning to bend, squealing softly.\nFar enough for her to slither between.\nShe pushed her bow, and quiver, and sword through first, holding them\nup in one hand. She hooked her head between the bars, turning sideways,\nsucking in her stomach and holding her breath, wriggling her shoulders,"

She hooked her head between the bars, turning sideways,\nsucking in her stomach and holding her breath, wriggling her shoulders,\nthen her chest, then her hips through the narrow gap, feeling the rough\nmetal scraping at her skin through her wet clothes.\nShe dragged herself onto the other side, tossing her weapons onto the\nbank. She braced her shoulders in the archway and planted her boots against\nthe next bar, every muscle straining while Ninefingers dragged on it from\nthe other side. It gave all of a sudden, snapping in half and showering flakes\nof rust into the stream, dumping her on her back, over her head in the\nfreezing water.\nNinefingers started to haul himself through, face twisted with effort.\nFerro floundered up, gasping with the cold, grabbed him under the arms and\nstarted pulling, felt his hands grip round her back. She grunted and wrestled\nand finally dragged him out. They flopped together onto the muddy bank\nand lay there, side by side. Ferro stared up at the crumbling walls of the\nruined city rising sheer above her in the grey dusk, breathing hard and\nlistening to Ninefingers do the same. She had not expected to get out of that\nplace alive.\nBut they were not away quite yet.\nShe rolled and clambered up, dripping wet and trying to stop herself\nfrom shivering. She wondered if she had ever been so cold in her whole\nlife.\n“That’s it,” she heard Ninefingers muttering. “By the fucking dead,\nthat’s it. I’m done. I’m not moving another stride.”\nFerro shook her head. “We need to make some distance while we still\nhave light.” She snatched up her weapons from the dirt.\n“You call this light? Are you fucking crazy, woman?”\n“You know I am. Let’s go, pink.” And she poked him in the ribs with her\nwet boot.\n“Alright, damn it! Alright!” He stumbled reluctantly up, swaying, and\nshe turned, started to walk up the bank through the twilight, away from the\nwalls.\n“What did I do?” She turned and looked at him, standing there, wet hair\ndripping round his face. “What did I do, back there?”\n“You got us through.”\n“I meant—”\n“You got us through.

Logen was too tired to do anything but nod and shamble after her.\nThin moonlight washed down into the empty shell, picking out the edges of\nstones, the shapes of old windows, the hard-packed dirt of the ground. He\nstumbled to the nearest wall and sagged against it, sliding slowly down until\nhis arse hit the mud.\n“Still alive,” he mouthed silently, and grinned to himself.

He\nsat motionless—damp and aching and utterly spent, let his eyes close, and\nenjoyed the feeling of not having to move.\nHe frowned. There was a strange sound in the darkness, over the\ntrickling of the stream. A tapping, clicking sound. It took him a moment to\nrealise what it was. Ferro’s teeth. He dragged his coat off, wincing as he\npulled it over his torn elbow, and held it out to her in the dark.\n“What’s this?”\n“A coat.”\n“I see it’s a coat. What for?”\nDamn it but she was stubborn. Logen almost laughed out loud. “I may\nnot have your eyes, but I can still hear your teeth rattling.” He held the coat\nout again. “Wish I had more to offer you, but this is all I’ve got. You need it\nmore ’n me, and there it is. No shame in that. Take it.”\nThere was a pause, then he felt it pulled out of his hand, heard her\nwrapping it round herself. “Thanks,” she grunted.\nHe raised his eyebrows, wondering if he could have heard that right.\nSeemed there was a first time for everything. “Alright. And to you.”\n“Uh?”\n“For the help. Under the city, and on the hill with the stones, and up on\nthe roofs, and all the rest.” He thought about it for a moment. “That’s a lot\nof help. More than I deserve, most likely, but, well, I’m still good and\ngrateful for it.” He waited for her to say something, but nothing came. Only\nthe sound of the stream gurgling under the walls of the building, the sound\nof the wind hissing through the empty windows, the sound of his own rough\nbreathing. “You’re alright,” he said. “That’s all I’m saying. Whatever you\ntry to make out, you’re alright.”\nMore silence. He could see her outline in the moonlight, sitting near the\nwall, his coat wrapped round her shoulders, damp hair sticking spiky from\nher head, perhaps the slightest gleam of a yellow eye, watching him. He\ncursed to himself under his breath. He was no good at talking, never had\nbeen. Probably none of that meant anything to her. Still, at least he’d tried.\n“You want to fuck?”\nHe looked up, mouth hanging open, not sure if he could’ve heard right.\n“Eh?”\n“What, pink, you gone deaf on me?”\n“Have I what?”\n“Alright! Forget it!” She turned away from him, pulling the coat angrily\nround her hunched shoulders.\n“Hold on, though.” He was starting to catch up. “I mean… I just wasn’t\nexpecting you to ask is all. I’m not saying no… I reckon… if you’re\nasking.” He swallowed, his mouth dry. “Are you asking?”\nHe saw her head turn back towards him. “You’re not saying no, or\nyou’re saying yes?”\n“Well, er…” He puffed his cheeks out in the dark, tried to make his head"

He’d never thought to be asked that question again in all his days,\nand least of all by her. Now it had been asked, he was scared to answer. He\ncouldn’t deny it was somewhat of a daunting prospect, but it was better to\ndo it than to live in fear of it. A lot better. “Yes, then. I think. I mean, of\ncourse I am. Why wouldn’t I? I’m saying yes.”\n“Uh.” He saw the outline of her face frowning down at the ground, thin\nlips pressed angrily together, like she’d been hoping for a different answer\nand wasn’t quite sure what to do with the one he’d given. He wasn’t either,\nif it came to that. “How do you want to get it done?” Matter-of-fact, as if it\nwas a job they had to get through, like cutting a tree down or digging a\nhole.\n“Er… well, you’ll have to get a bit closer, I reckon. I mean, I hope my\ncock ain’t that disappointing, but it won’t reach you over there.” He half\nsmiled, then cursed to himself when she didn’t. He knew she wasn’t much\nfor jokes.\n“Right then.” She came at him so quick and businesslike he half backed\noff, and that made her falter.\n“Sorry,” he said. “Haven’t done this in a while.”\n“No.” She squatted down next to him, lifted her arm, paused as if she\nwas wondering what to do with it. “Nor me.” He felt her fingertips on the\nback of his hand—gentle, cautious. It almost tickled, her touch was so light.\nHer thumb rubbed at the stump of his middle finger, and he watched her do\nit, grey shapes moving in the shadows, awkward as a pair who’d never\ntouched another person in their lives. Strange feeling, having a woman so\nclose to him. Brought back all kind of memories.\nLogen reached up slowly, feeling like he was about to put his hand in the\nfire, and touched Ferro’s face. It didn’t burn. Her skin was smooth and cool,\njust like anyone’s would have been. He pushed his hand into her hair, felt it\ntickling the webs between his fingers. He found the scar on her forehead\nwith the very tip of his thumb, traced the line of it down her cheek to the\ncorner of her mouth, tugging at her lip, his skin brushing rough against hers.\nThere was a strange set to her face, he could tell it even in the dark. It\nwas one he wasn’t used to seeing on her, but there was no mistaking it. He\ncould feel the muscles tense under her skin, see the moonlight on the cords\nstanding from her scrawny neck. She was scared. She could laugh while she\nkicked a man in the face, smile at cuts and punches, treat an arrow through\nher flesh like it was nothing, but it seemed a gentle touch could put the fear\nin her. Would’ve seemed pretty strange to Logen, if he hadn’t been so damn\nfrightened himself. Frightened and excited all at once."

He\nstruggled with the buttons on her shirt in the darkness, hands trembling,\nchewing at his lip, as clumsy as if he’d had gauntlets on. She had his open\nbefore he’d even done one of hers.\n“Shit!” he hissed. She slapped his hands away and undid the buttons\nherself, pulled her shirt off, and dropped it beside her. He couldn’t see much\nin the moonlight, only the gleaming of her eyes, the dark outline of her\nbony shoulders and her bony waist, splashes of faint light between her ribs\nand the curve underneath one tit, a bit of rough skin round a nipple, maybe.\nHe felt her pull his belt open, felt her cool fingers sliding into his\ntrousers, felt her—\n“Ah! Shit! You don’t have to lift me up by it!”\n“Alright…”\n“Ah.”\n“Better?”\n“Ah.” He dragged at her belt and fumbled it open, dug his hand down\ninside. Hardly subtle, maybe, but then he’d never been known for subtlety.\nHis fingertips made it more or less into hair before he got his wrist stuck\ntight. It wouldn’t go any further, for all his straining.\n“Shit,” he muttered, heard Ferro suck her teeth, felt her shift and grab\nher trousers with her free hand, dragging them down over her arse. That\nwas better. He slid his hand up her bare thigh. Good thing he still had one\nmiddle finger. They have their uses.\nThey stayed like that for a while, the pair of them kneeling in the dirt,\nnothing much moving apart from their two hands working back and\nforward, up and down, in and out, starting slow and gentle and getting\nquicker, silent except for Ferro’s breath hissing through her teeth, Logen’s\nrasping in his throat, the quiet suck and squelch of damp skin moving.\nShe pushed herself up against him, wriggling out of her trousers,\nshoving him back up against the wall. He cleared his throat, suddenly\nhoarse. “Should I—”\n“Ssss.” She got up on one foot and one knee, squatting over him with\nher legs wide open, spat in one cupped hand and took hold of his cock with\nit. She muttered something, shifting her weight, easing herself down onto\nhim, grunting softly. “Urrrr.”\n“Ah.” He reached out and pulled her closer, one hand squeezing at the\nback of her thigh, feeling the muscles bunch and shift as she moved, the\nother tangled tight in her greasy hair, dragging her head down against his\nface. His trousers were screwed up tight round his ankles. He tried to kick\nthem off and only got them tangled worse than ever, but he was damned if\nhe was going to ask her to stop just for that.\n“Urrrr,” she whispered at him, mouth open, lips sliding warm and soft\nagainst his cheek, breath hot and sour in his mouth, her skin rubbing against\nhis, and sticking to it, and peeling away again."

All that time waiting and he hadn’t\nbeen able to keep the milk in the bucket. He scratched his face sadly, picked\nat his scabby chin. Say one thing for Logen Ninefingers, say he’s a lover.\nHe looked sideways at Ferro, at her faint outline in the darkness. Spiky\nhair, long neck stretched out, sharp shoulder, long arm pressed down against\nher side. Even with the coat over her he could see the rise of her hip, he\ncould guess her shape underneath. He looked at her skin, knowing what it\nfelt like—smooth, and sleek, and cool. He could hear her breathing. Soft,\nslow, warm breathing…\nHold on.\nThere was something stirring down below again, now. Sore, but\ndefinitely stiffening. The one advantage of having a long time without—the\nbucket fills up again quick. Logen licked his lips. It would be a shame to let\nthe chance pass, just for a lack of nerve. He slid down beside her, shuffled\nup close, and cleared his throat.\n“What?” Her voice was sharp, but not quite sharp enough to warn him\noff.\n“Well, you know, give me a minute, and maybe…” He lifted the coat up\nand ran his hand up her side, skin hissing quietly against skin, nice and\nslow, so she had plenty of time to shove him off. It wouldn’t have surprised\nhim any if she’d turned over and kneed him in the fruits. But she didn’t.\nShe shifted back against him, her bare arse pressing into his stomach,\nlifting one knee up. “Why should I be giving you another chance?”\n“I don’t know…” he muttered, starting to grin. He slid his hand gently\nover her chest, across her belly, down between her legs. “Same reason you\ngave me the first one?”\nF\nerro woke with a sudden jolt, not knowing where she was, only that she\nwas trapped.

Then she had elbowed Ninefingers in the face. And what was\nmuch, much worse, so stupid she almost grimaced to think of it: She had\nfucked him the night before. Staring at him now in the harsh light of day,\nhair plastered against one side of his scarred and bloody face, a great smear\nof dirt down his pale side where he had been lying in the mud, she was not\nsure why. For some reason, cold and tired in the dark, she had wanted to\ntouch someone, and be warm for just a moment, and she had let herself\nthink—who would be worse off for it?\nMadness.\nThey both were worse off, that was clear enough. Where things had been\nsimple, now they were sure to be complicated. Where they had been getting\nan understanding, now there would be only confusion. She was confused\nalready, and he was starting to look hurt, and angry, and what was the\nsurprise? No one enjoys an elbow in the face while they sleep. She opened\nher mouth to say sorry, and it was then she realised. She did not even know\nthe word. All she could do was say it in Kantic, but she was so angry with\nherself she growled it at him like an insult.\nHe certainly took it as one. His eyes narrowed and he snapped\nsomething at her in his own tongue, snatched his trousers up and shoved\none leg in, muttering angrily under his breath.\n“Fucking pink,” she hissed back, fists bunched with a surge of fury. She\nsnatched up her torn shirt and turned her back on him. She must have left it\nin a wet patch. The ragged cloth stuck tight to her crawling skin like a layer\nof cold mud as she yanked it on.\nDamn shirt. Damn pink.\nShe ground her teeth with frustration as she dragged her belt closed.\nDamn belt. If only she could have kept it closed. It was always the same.\nNothing was easy with people, but she could always count on herself to\nmake things more difficult than they had to be. She paused for a moment,\nwith her head down, then she half turned towards him.\nShe was about to try and explain that she had not meant to smash his\nmouth, but that nothing good ever happened when she slept.

A bond that\nleft his old friendships weak, and pale, and passionless by comparison.\nJezal watched the figures come closer, trudging along the crumbling\ntrack that led up through the steep rocks to the temple, a great deal of space\nbetween the two of them, almost as if they were walking separately. Closer\nstill, and they began to look like two prisoners that had escaped from hell.\nTheir clothes were ripped, and torn, and utterly filthy, their dirty faces were\nhard as a pair of stones. Ferro had a scabbed-over gash across her forehead.\nLogen’s jaw was a mass of grazes, the skin round his eyes stained with dark\nbruising.\nJezal took a hopping step towards them. “What happened? How did—”\n“Nothing happened,” barked Ferro.\n“Nothing at all,” growled Ninefingers, and the two of them scowled\nangrily at each other. Plainly, they had both gone through some awful\nordeal that neither one wished to discuss. Ferro stalked straight to the cart\nwithout the slightest greeting and started rooting through the back. Logen\nstood, hands on his hips, frowning grimly after her.\n“So…” mumbled Jezal, not quite sure what to say, “are you alright?”\nLogen’s eyes swivelled to his. “Oh, I’m grand,” he said, with heavy\nirony. “Never better. How the hell did you get that cart out of there?”\nThe apprentice shrugged. “The horses pulled it out.”\n“Master Quai has a gift for understatement,” chuckled Longfoot\nnervously. “It was a most exhilarating ride to the city’s South Gate—”\n“Fight your way out, did you?”\n“Well, not I, of course, fighting is not my—”\n“Didn’t think so.” Logen leaned over and spat sourly onto the mud.\n“We should at least consider being grateful,” croaked Bayaz, the air\nsighing and crackling in his throat as he breathed in. “There is much to be\ngrateful for, after all. We are all still alive.”\n“You sure?” snapped Ferro. “You don’t look it.” Jezal found himself in\nsilent agreement there. The Magus could not have looked worse if he had\nactually died in Aulcus. Died, and already begun to decompose.\nShe ripped off her rag of a shirt and flung it savagely on the ground,\nsinews shifting across her scrawny back. “Fuck are you looking at?” she\nsnarled at Jezal.\n“Nothing,” he muttered, staring down at the dirt. When he dared to look\nup, she was buttoning a fresh one up the front. Well, not entirely fresh. He\nhad been wearing it himself a few days ago.\n“That’s one of mine…” Ferro looked up at him with a glare so\nmurderous that Jezal found himself taking a hesitant step back. “But you’re\nwelcome to it… of course…”\n“Ssss,” she hissed, jamming the hem violently down behind her belt,\nfrowning all the while as if she was stabbing a man to death. Probably him.\nAll in all, it was hardly the tearful reunion that Jezal might have hoped for,\neven if he did now feel somewhat like crying."

Do you think you could dream up a different way back?”\nBayaz frowned. “That would seem prudent. We will return to Calcis\ndown the river. There are woods on this side of the water, further\ndownstream. A few sturdy tree trunks lashed together, and the Aos will\ncarry us straight to the sea.”\n“Or to a watery grave.” Jezal remembered with some clarity the surging\nwater in the canyon of the great river.\n“My hope is better.

Unfortunately, not all the horses survived.” The Navigator raised\nhis eyebrows. “We have two to pull the cart, two to ride… that leaves us\ntwo short.”\n“I hate those fucking things anyway.” Logen strode to the cart and\nclambered up opposite Bayaz in the back.\nThere was a long pause as they all considered the situation. Two horses,\nthree riders. Never a happy position.

He licked at his sore gums, rubbed at his\nsore thigh, swept his grimace up and down the grey shoreline. A pair of\nsurly-looking guardsmen were leaning against a rotten warehouse ten paces\naway. Further on, a party of dockers were involved in a bitter dispute over a\nheap of crates. A shivering beggar nearby took a couple of paces towards\nGlokta, thought better of it, and slunk away.\nNo crowds of cheering commoners? No carpet of flower petals? No\narchway of drawn swords? No bevy of swooning maidens? It was hardly too\ngreat a surprise. There had been none the last time he returned from the\nSouth. Crowds rarely cheer too loudly for the defeated, no matter how hard\nthey fought, how great their sacrifices, how long the odds. Maidens might\nwet themselves over cheap and worthless victories, but they don’t so much\nas blush for “I did my best.” Nor will the Arch Lector, I fear."

He stumbled forward, cold water\ndripping from his cold hands; slipped and almost fell; tottered, gasping\nacross the quay; and clung to the slimy wall of a crumbling shed at the far\nside. He looked up and saw the two guards staring at him.\n“Is there something?” he snarled, and they turned their backs, muttering\nand pulling up their collars against the weather. Glokta fumbled his coat\ntight around him, felt the tails snatching at his wet legs. A few months in the\nsun and you feel as though you’ll never be cold again. How soon we forget.\nHe frowned up and down the empty wharves. How soon we all forget.\n“Ome ageh.” Frost looked pleased as he stepped off the gangplank with\nGlokta’s box under his arm.\n“You don’t much like hot weather, do you?”\nThe Practical shook his heavy head, half grinning into the winter drizzle,\nwhite hair spiky with wet. Severard followed behind him, squinting up at\nthe grey clouds. He paused for a moment at the end of the plank, then he\nstepped off onto the stones of the quay.\n“Good to be back,” he said.\nI only wish I could share your enthusiasm, but I cannot relax quite yet.\n“His Eminence has sent for me, and judging by the way we left things in\nDagoska, I think it more than likely that the meeting will… not go well.” A\nspectacular understatement. “You had better stay out of sight for a couple\nof days.”\n“Out of sight? I don’t plan to see outside of a whorehouse for a week.”\n“Very wise. And Severard. In case we don’t see each other again. Good\nluck.”\nThe Practical’s eyes glinted. “Always.” Glokta watched him stroll off\nthrough the rain towards the seedier parts of town. Just another day for\nPractical Severard. Never thinking more than an hour ahead. What a gift.\n“Damn your miserable country and damn its bloody weather,” Vitari\ngrumbled in her singsong accent. “I have to go and speak to Sult.”\n“Why, so do I!” cried Glokta with exaggerated glee. “What a charming\ncoincidence!” He offered her his bent elbow. “We can make a couple, and\nvisit His Eminence together!”\nShe stared back at him. “Alright.”\nBut the pair of you will have to wait another hour for my head. “There’s\njust one call I need to make first.”\nT\nhe tip of his stick cracked against the door. No answer. Damn it. Glokta’s\nback was hurting like hell and he needed to sit down. He rapped again with\nhis cane, harder this time. The hinges creaked, the door swung open a crack.\nUnlocked.

But why? Glokta’s eyelid gave a twitch. He had\nscarcely once thought about Ardee his whole time in the South. Other\nmatters seemed so much more pressing. My one friend gave me this one\ntask. If anything has happened to her…\nGlokta pointed to the stairs, and Vitari nodded and crept up them\nsilently, bending and sliding a glinting knife out from her boot. He pointed\ndown the hall, and Frost padded off deeper into the house, pressed up into\nthe shadows by the wall. The living room door stood ajar, and Glokta\nshuffled to it and pushed it open.\nArdee was sitting in the window with her back to him: white dress, dark\nhair, just as he remembered her. He saw her head move slightly as the\ndoor’s hinges creaked. Alive, then. But the room was strangely altered.\nAside from the one chair she sat in, it was entirely empty. Bare,\nwhitewashed walls, bare wooden boards, windows without curtains.\n“There’s nothing fucking left!” she barked, voice cracked and throaty.\nClearly. Glokta frowned, and stepped through the door into the room.\n“Nothing left, I said!” She stood up, still with her back to him. “Or did\nyou decide you’d take the chair after all?” She spun round, grabbing hold of\nthe back, lifted it over her head, and flung it at him with a shriek. It crashed\ninto the wall beside the door, sending fragments of wood and plaster flying.\nOne leg whizzed past Glokta’s face and clattered into the corner, the rest\ntumbled to the floor in a mass of dust and splintered sticks.\n“Most kind,” murmured Glokta, “but I prefer to stand.”\n“You!” He could see her eyes wide with surprise through her tangled\nhair. There was a gauntness and a paleness to her face that he did not\nremember. Her dress was rumpled, and far too thin for the chilly room. She\ntried to smooth it with shivering hands, plucked ineffectually at her greasy\nhair. She gave a snort of laughter. “I’m afraid I’m not really prepared for\nvisitors.”\nGlokta heard Frost thumping down the hall, saw him looming up at the\ndoorway, fists clenched. He held up a finger. “It’s alright. Wait outside.” The\nalbino faded back into the shadows, and Glokta hobbled across the creaking\nboards into the empty sitting room. “What happened?”\nArdee’s mouth twisted. “It seems my father was not nearly so well off as\neveryone imagined. He had debts. Soon after my brother left for Angland,\nthey came to collect.”\n“Who came?”\n“A man called Fallow. He took all the money I had, but it wasn’t\nenough. They took the plate, my mother’s jewels, such as they were. They\ngave me six weeks to find the rest. I let my maid go. I sold everything I\ncould, but they wanted more. Then they came again.

Fallow said I was lucky he was leaving me the dress I was\nwearing.”\n“I see.”\nShe took a deep, shuddering breath. “Since then, I have been sitting\nhere, and thinking on how a friendless young woman can come by some\nmoney.” She fixed him with her eye. “I have thought of only one way. I\ndaresay, if I had the courage, I would have done it already.”\nGlokta sucked at his gums. “Lucky for us both that you’re a coward,\nthen.” He shrugged one shoulder out of his coat, then had to wriggle and\nflail to get his arm out. Once he finally did, he had to fumble his cane across\ninto his other hand so he could finally throw it off. Damn it. I can’t even\nmake a generous gesture gracefully. Finally he held it out to her, tottering\nslightly on his weak leg.\n“You sure you don’t need it more than me?”\n“Take it. At least then I won’t have to get the bloody thing back on.”\nThat brought half a smile from her. “Thank you,” she muttered as she\npulled it round her shoulders. “I tried to find you, but I didn’t know…\nwhere you were…”\n“I am sorry for that, but I am here now. You need not worry about\nanything. You will have to come and stay with me tonight. My quarters are\nnot spacious, but we’ll find a way.” There will be plenty of room once I am\nfacedown in the docks, after all.\n“What about after that?”\n“After that you will come here. Tomorrow this house will be just as it\nwas.”\nShe stared at him. “How?”\n“Oh, I will see to it. First of all we get you in the warm.” Superior\nGlokta, friend to the friendless.\nShe closed her eyes as he spoke, and he heard breath snorting fast\nthrough her nose. She swayed slightly, as if she hardly had the strength to\nstand any longer. Strange how, as long as the hardship lasts, we can stand\nit. As soon as the crisis is over, the strength all leeches away in an instant.\nGlokta reached out, almost touched her shoulder to steady her, but at the\nlast moment her eyes flickered open, and she straightened up again, and he\npulled his hand away.\nSuperior Glokta, rescuer of young women in distress. He guided her into\nthe hallway and towards the broken front door. “If you could give me one\nmoment with my Practicals.”\n“Of course.” Ardee looked up at him, big, dark eyes rimmed with\nworried pink. “And thank you. Whatever they say, you’re a good man.”\nGlokta had to stifle a sudden urge to giggle. A good man? I doubt that\nSalem Rews would agree.

And yet Ardee West thinks\nme a good man. A strange feeling, and not an unpleasant one. It feels almost\nlike being human again. What a shame that it comes so late in the day.\nHe beckoned to Frost as Ardee shuffled out in his black coat. “I have a\ntask for you, my old friend. One last task.” Glokta slapped his hand down\non the albino’s heavy shoulder and squeezed it. “Do you know a\nmoneylender called Fallow?”\nFrost nodded slowly.\n“Find him and hurt him. Bring him here and make him understand who\nhe has offended. Everything must be restored, better than it was, tell him\nthat. Give him one day. One day, and then you find him, wherever he is, and\nyou start cutting. You hear me? Do me that one favour.”\nFrost nodded again, his pink eyes glinting in the dim hallway.\n“Sult will be expecting us,” murmured Vitari, peering down at them\nfrom the stairs, arms crossed, gloved hands hanging limp over the rail.\n“Of course he will.” Glokta winced as he hobbled to the open door. And\nwe wouldn’t want to keep His Eminence waiting.\nC\nlick, tap, pain, that was the rhythm of Glokta’s walking. The confident\nclick of his right heel, the tap of his cane on the echoing tiles of the hallway,\nthen the long scrape of his left foot with the familiar pain in the knee, arse\nand back. Click, tap, pain.\nHe had walked from the docks to Ardee’s house, to the Agriont, to the\nHouse of Questions, and all the way up here. Limped. On my own. Without\nhelp. Now every step was agony. He grimaced with each movement. He\ngrunted and sweated and cursed. But I’m damned if I’m slowing down.\n“You don’t like to make things easy, do you?” muttered Vitari.\n“Why should they be?” he snapped. “You can console yourself with the\nthought that this conversation will most likely be our last.”\n“Then why even come? Why not run?”\nGlokta snorted. “In case you hadn’t noticed, I am an exceptionally poor\nrunner. That and I’m curious.” Curious to know why His Eminence didn’t\nleave me there to rot along with all the rest.\n“Your curiosity might be the death of you.”\n“If the Arch Lector wants me dead, limping the other way will do me\nlittle good. I’d rather take it standing up.” He winced at a sudden spasm\nthrough his leg. “Or maybe sitting down. Either way, face-to-face, with my\neyes open.”\n“Your choice, I suppose.”\n“That’s right.” My last one.\nThey came into Sult’s anteroom.

The heavy desk, the heavy\nchairs, the two towering Practicals flanking the heavy doors, were all the\nsame.\n“I am—”\n“Superior Glokta, of course.” The Arch Lector’s secretary bowed his\nhead respectfully. “You may go in at once. His Eminence is expecting you.”\nLight spilled out of the Arch Lector’s office and into the narrow chamber.\n“I’ll wait here.” Vitari slid into one of the chairs and swung her damp\nboots up on another.\n“Don’t bother waiting too long.” My last words, perhaps? Glokta cursed\ninwardly as he shuffled towards the doorway. I really should have thought\nof something more memorable. He paused for just a moment at the\nthreshold, took a deep breath, and hobbled through.\nThe same airy, round room. The same dark furniture, the same dark\npictures on the bright walls, the same great window with the same view of\nthe University, and the House of the Maker beyond. No assassins loitering\nunder the table, no axemen waiting behind the door. Only Sult himself,\nsitting at his desk with a pen in hand, the nib scratching calmly and evenly\nacross some papers spread out before him.\n“Superior Glokta!” Sult started up and swept gracefully across the\npolished floor towards him, white coat flapping. “I’m so glad you are safely\nreturned!” The Arch Lector gave every impression of being pleased to see\nhim, and Glokta frowned. He had been prepared for almost anything but\nthis.\nSult held out his hand, the stone on his ring of office flashing purple\nsparks. Glokta grimaced as he bent slowly to kiss it. “I serve and obey, Your\nEminence.” He straightened up with an effort. No knife in the back of the\nneck? But Sult was already flowing across to the cabinet, grinning broadly.\n“Sit, please sit! You need not wait to be asked!”\nSince when? Glokta grunted his way into one of the chairs, taking only\nthe briefest moment to check for poisoned spikes on the seat. The Arch\nLector, meanwhile, had plucked open the cabinet and was rummaging\ninside. Will he pull out a loaded flatbow, and shoot me through the throat?\nBut all that emerged were two glasses. “It would seem congratulations are\nin order,” he threw over his shoulder.\nGlokta blinked. “What?”\n“Congratulations. Excellent work.” Sult grinned down at him as he slid\nthe glasses gracefully onto the round table, eased the stopper, clinking, from\nthe decanter. What to say? What to say?\n“Your Eminence… Dagoska… I must be candid. It was on the point of\nfalling when I left. Very soon now, the city will be overrun—”\n“Of course it will.” Sult dismissed it all with a wave of his white-gloved\nhand. “There was never the slightest chance of holding it. The best I was\nhoping for was that you’d make the Gurkish pay! And how you did that, eh,\nGlokta? How you did that!”"

How you did that!”\n“Then… you are… pleased?” He hardly dared say the word.\n“I am delighted! If I had written the tale myself, it could not have\nworked out better! The incompetence of the Lord Governor, the treachery\nof his son, it all showed how little the regular authorities can be relied upon\nin a crisis. Eider’s treason exposed the duplicity of the merchants, their\ndubious connections, their rotten morality! The Spicers have been dissolved\nalongside the Mercers: Their trade rights are in our hands. The pair of them,\nconsigned to the latrine of history and the power of the merchants broken!\nOnly His Majesty’s Inquisition remained staunch in the face of the Union’s\nmost implacable enemy. You should have seen Marovia’s face when I\npresented the confessions to the Open Council!” Sult filled Glokta’s glass\nall the way to the top.\n“Most kind, Your Eminence,” he muttered as he took a sip from it.\nExcellent wine, as always.\n“And then he got up in the Closed Council, before the King himself,\nmark you, and declared to everyone that you wouldn’t last a week once the\nGurkish attacked!” The Arch Lector spluttered with laughter. “I wish you\ncould have been there. I’m confident he’ll do better than that, I said.\nConfident he’ll do better.” A ringing endorsement indeed.\nSult slapped the table with his white-gloved palm. “Two months,\nGlokta! Two months! With every day that passed he looked more of a fool,\nand I looked more of a hero… we, that is,” he corrected himself, “we\nlooked like heroes, and all I had to do was smile! You could almost see\nthem, each day, shuffling their chairs away from Marovia and down towards\nme! Last week they voted extra powers to the Inquisition. Nine votes to\nthree. Nine to three! Next week we’ll go further! How the hell did you\nmanage it?” And he gazed at Glokta expectantly.\nI sold myself to the bank that funded the Mercers, then used the proceeds\nto bribe the world’s least reliable mercenary. Then I murdered a defenceless\nemissary under flag of parley and tortured a serving girl until her body was\nmincemeat. Oh, and I let the biggest traitor of the lot go free. It was,\nwithout doubt, a heroic business. How did I manage it? “Rising early,” he\nmurmured.\nSult’s eye flickered, and Glokta caught it. A trace of annoyance,\nperhaps? A trace of mistrust? But it was quickly extinguished. “Rising\nearly. Of course.” He raised his glass. “The second greatest virtue. It comes\njust behind ruthlessness. I like your style, Glokta, I’ve always said so.”\nHave you indeed? But Glokta humbly inclined his head.\n“Practical Vitari’s despatches were filled with admiration.

Except for the damn peasants making a nuisance of\nthemselves, and Angland of course. Shame about Ladisla.”\n“About Ladisla?” asked Glokta, baffled.\nSult looked sour. “You didn’t hear? Another of High Justice Marovia’s\nbrilliant notions. He had it in mind to lift the Crown Prince’s popularity by\ngiving him a command in the North. Something out of the way, where he’d\nbe in no danger and we could heap him with glory. It wasn’t a bad scheme,\nreally, except that ‘out of the way’ became ‘in the way,’ and he commanded\nhimself straight into his grave.”\n“His army with him?”\n“A few thousand of them, but mostly that rubbish the nobles sent as\nlevies. Nothing of much significance. Ostenhorm is still in our hands, and it\nwasn’t my idea, so, all in all, no harm done. Between you and me it’s\nprobably for the best, Ladisla was insufferable. I had to dig him out of more\nthan one scandal. Never could keep his trousers closed, the damn half-wit.\nRaynault seems to be a different kind of a man. Sober, sensible. Do as he’s\nbloody told. Better all round. Providing he doesn’t go and get himself\nkilled, of course, we’d be in a pickle then.” Sult took another swig from his\nglass and worked it round his mouth with some satisfaction.\nGlokta cleared his throat. While he is in a good mood…“There was one\nissue I wished to discuss with you, Your Eminence. The Gurkish agent we\nfound within the city. She was…” How to describe this without sounding\nlike a madman?\nBut Sult was ahead of him once again. “I know. An Eater.” You know?\nEven about this? The Arch Lector sat back and shook his head. “An occult\nabomination. A tale straight from a storybook. Eating the flesh of men.\nApparently it is a practice well established down in the barbaric South. But\ndon’t concern yourself about it. I am already taking advice.”\n“Who gives advice about such things as these?”\nThe Arch Lector only flashed his silky smile. “You must be tired. The\nweather over there can be so very draining. All that heat and dust, even in\nthe winter. Take a rest. You deserve it. I’ll send for you if anything comes\nup.” And Sult took up his pen and looked back to his papers, leaving Glokta\nwith nothing to do but shuffle for the door, a look of profound puzzlement\non his face.\n“You almost look like you’re still alive,” muttered Vitari as he hobbled\nout into the anteroom.\nTrue. Or about as close as I come to it. “Sult was… pleased.” He still\ncould hardly believe it. The very words sounded strange together."

Just trust me next time.”\n“A fair demand,” he conceded, glancing sideways at her. But you have to\nbe joking.\nT\nhe chamber was filled with fine furniture. Almost overfilled. Richly\nupholstered chairs, an antique table, a polished cabinet, all lavish for the\nsmall sitting room. A huge old painting of the Lords of the Union paying\nhomage to Harod the Great entirely filled one wall. A thick Kantic carpet\nhad been rolled out across the boards, almost too big for the floor. A healthy\nfire crackled in the grate between two antique vases, and the room was\nhomely, and pleasant, and warm. What a difference a day can make, with\nthe right encouragement.\n“Good,” said Glokta as he looked round. “Very good.”\n“Of course,” muttered Fallow, head bowed respectfully, hat halfway to\nbeing crushed in his hands. “Of course, Superior, I have done everything\npossible. Most of the furniture I had… I had sold already, and so I replaced\nwith better, the best I could find. The rest of the house is just the same. I\nhope that… I hope that it’s adequate?”\n“I hope so too. Is it adequate?”\nArdee was scowling at Fallow. “It will serve.”\n“Excellent,” said the moneylender nervously, glancing briefly at Frost\nand then down at his boots. “Excellent! Please accept my very deepest\napologies! I had no idea, of course, absolutely no idea, Superior, that you\nwere involved in any way. Of course, I would never… I am so very sorry.”\n“It really isn’t me you should be apologising to, is it?”\n“No, no, of course.” He turned slowly to Ardee. “My lady, please accept\nmy deepest apologies.”\nArdee glared at him, lip curled, and said nothing.\n“Perhaps if you were to beg,” suggested Glokta. “On your knees. That\nmight do it.”\nFallow dropped to his knees without hesitation. He wrung his hands.\n“My lady, please—”\n“Lower,” said Glokta.\n“Of course,” he muttered as he fell to all fours. “I do apologise, my lady.\nMost humbly. If you could only find it in your heart, I beg you—” He\nreached out gingerly to touch the hem of her dress and she jerked back, then\nswung her foot and kicked him savagely in the face.\n“Gah!” squawked the moneylender, rolling onto his side, dark blood\nbubbling out of his nose and all over the new carpet. Glokta felt his brows\ngo up. That was unexpected.\n“That’s for you, fucker!” The next kick caught him in the mouth and his\nhead snapped back, spots of blood spattering onto the far wall.

Her\nheel dug into Fallow’s ribs, her toe cracked into his nose again. If she ever\ngets bored, she might have a bright future as a Practical. She worked her\nmouth, leaned over, and spat onto the side of his face. She kicked him\nagain, weakly, then stumbled back against the cabinet and leaned on the\npolished wood, bent over and breathing hard.\n“Happy?” asked Glokta.\nShe stared up at him through her tangled hair. “Not really.”\n“Will kicking him some more make you happier?”\nHer brows wrinkled as she looked down at Fallow, wheezing on his side\non the carpet. She took a step forward and booted him hard in the chest one\nmore time, rocked away, wiping some snot from under her nose. She\npushed her hair out of her face. “I’m done.”\n“Fine. Get out,” hissed Glokta. “Out, worm!”\n“Of course.” Fallow drooled through his bloody lips, crawling for the\ndoor, Frost looming over him the whole way. “Of course! Thank you!\nThank you all so much!” The front door banged shut.\nArdee sat down heavily in one of the chairs, elbows resting on her\nknees, forehead resting on her palms. Glokta could see her hands trembling\nslightly. It can really be very tiring, hurting someone. I should know.\nEspecially if you aren’t used to it. “I wouldn’t feel too badly,” he said. “I’m\nsure he deserved it.”\nShe looked up, and her eyes were hard. “I don’t. He deserves worse.”\nThat was unexpected too. “Do you want him to have worse?”\nShe swallowed, slowly sat back. “No.”\n“Up to you.” But it’s nice to have the option. “You may want to change\nyour clothes.”\nShe looked down. “Oh.” Spots of Fallow’s blood were spattered as far as\nher knees. “I don’t have anything—”\n“There’s a room full of new ones, upstairs. I made sure of it. I’ll arrange\nfor some dependable servants as well.”\n“I don’t need them.”\n“Yes, you do. I won’t hear of you here alone.”\nShe shrugged her shoulders hopelessly. “I have nothing to pay them\nwith.”\n“Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it.” All compliments of the hugely\ngenerous Valint and Balk, after all. “Don’t worry about anything. I made a\npromise to your brother, and I mean to see it through.

I caused thousands of them not long ago, with hardly a thought. I\nlooked at heaps of corpses and shrugged. What makes this one so hard to\ntake? And yet it was.\n“Killed?” he whispered.\nShe nodded slowly, and put her face in her hands.\nCold Comfort\nW\nest peered out of the bushes, through the drifting flakes of snow, down\nthe slope toward the Union picket. The sentries were sat in a rough circle,\nhunched round a steaming pan over a miserable tongue of fire on the far\nside of the stream. They wore thick coats, breath smoking, weapons almost\nforgotten in the snow around them. West knew how they felt. Bethod might\ncome this week, he might come next week, but the cold they had to fight\nevery minute of every day.\n“Right then,” whispered Threetrees. “You’d best go down there on your\nown. They might not like the looks of me and the rest of the boys, all\nrushing down on ’em from the trees.”\nThe Dogman grinned. “Might shoot one of us.”\n“And that’d be some kind o’ shame,” hissed Dow, “after we come so\nfar.”\n“Give us the shout when they’re good and ready for a crew of Northmen\nto come wandering out the woods, eh?”\n“I will,” said West. He dragged the heavy sword out of his belt and\nhanded it to Threetrees. “You’d better hold on to this for me.”\n“Good luck,” said the Dogman.\n“Good luck,” said Dow, lips curling back into his savage grin.\n“Furious.”\nWest walked out slowly from the trees and down the gentle slope\ntowards the stream, his stolen boots crunching in the snow, his hands held\nup above his head, to show he was unarmed. Even so, he could hardly have\nblamed the sentries if they shot him on sight. No one could have looked\nmore like a dangerous savage than he did now, he knew. The last tatters of\nhis uniform were hidden beneath a bundle of furs and torn scraps, tied\naround his body with twine, a stained coat stolen from a dead Northman\nover the top. He had a few weeks’ growth of scraggy beard across his\nscabby face, his eyes were sore and watering, sunken with hunger and\nexhaustion. He looked like a desperate man, and what was more, he knew,"

The man who murdered Crown Prince Ladisla. The\nvery worst of traitors.\nOne of the sentries looked up and saw him, started clumsily from his\nplace, knocking the pan hissing into the fire, snatching his spear out of the\nsnow. “Stop!” he shouted, in slurred Northern. The others jumped up after\nhim, grabbing at their weapons, one fumbling at the string on his flatbow\nwith mittened fingers.\nWest stopped, flecks of snow settling gently on his tangled hair and\nacross his shoulders. “Don’t worry,” he shouted back in common. “I’m on\nyour side.”\nThey stared at him for a moment. “We’ll see!” shouted one. “Come on\nacross the water, but do it slow!”\nHe crunched on down the slope and sloshed out into the stream, gritted\nhis teeth as the freezing water soaked him up to his thighs. He struggled up\nthe far bank, and the four sentries shuffled into a nervous half circle around\nhim, weapons raised.\n“Watch him!”\n“It could be a trick!”\n“It’s no trick,” said West slowly, keeping his eyes on the various\nhovering blades and trying to stay calm. It was vitally important to stay\ncalm. “I’m one of you.”\n“Where the hell have you come from?”\n“I was with Prince Ladisla’s division.”\n“With Ladisla? You walked up here?”\nWest nodded. “I walked.” The bodies of the sentries started to relax, the\nspear-points started to waver and drift upwards. They were on the point of\nbelieving him. After all, he spoke the common tongue like a native, and\ncertainly looked as if he had slogged a hundred leagues across country.\n“What’s your name, then?” asked the one with the flatbow.\n“Colonel West,” he muttered, voice cracking. He felt like a liar even\nthough it was true. He was a different man from the one who set out for\nAngland.\nThe sentries exchanged worried glances. “I thought he was dead,”\nmumbled the one with the spear.\n“Not quite, lad,” said West. “Not quite.”\nL\nord Marshal Burr was poring over a table covered in crumpled maps as\nWest pushed through the flap into his tent. It seemed in the lamplight that\nthe pressures of command had taken their toll on him. He looked older,\npaler, weaker, his hair and beard wild and straggling. He had lost weight\nand his creased uniform hung loose, but he started up with all his old\nvigour.\n“Colonel West, as I live and breathe! I never thought to see you again!”\nHe seized West’s hand and squeezed it hard. “I’m glad you made it. Damn\nglad! I’ve missed your cool head around here, I don’t mind telling you.” He\nstared searchingly into West’s eyes. “You look tired, though, my friend.”\nThere was no denying it.

He had scarcely recognised the face in the\nmirror once he had taken his first bath in weeks, dragged on a borrowed\nuniform, and finally shaved. Everything was changed, sharpened, leached of\ncolour. The prominent cheekbones had grown craggy, the thinning hair and\nbrows were full of iron grey, the jaw was lean and wolflike. Angry lines\nwere cut deep into the skin down the pale cheeks, across the narrow bridge\nof the sharp nose, out from the corners of the eyes. The eyes were worst of\nall. Narrow. Hungry. Icy grey, as though the bitter cold had eaten into his\nskull and still lurked there, even in the warmth. He had tried to think of old\ntimes, to smile and laugh, and use the expressions he had used to use, but it\nall looked foolish on that stone wall of a face. A hard man had glared back\nat him from the glass, and would not go away.\n“It was a difficult journey, sir.”\nBurr nodded. “Of course it was, of course. A bastard of a journey and the\nwrong time of year for it. A good thing I sent those Northmen with you, eh,\nas it turned out?”\n“A very good thing, sir. A most courageous and resourceful group. They\nsaved my life, more than once.” He glanced sideways at Pike, loitering\nbehind him in the shadows at a respectful distance. “All our lives.”\nBurr peered over at the convict’s melted face. “And who is this?”\n“This is Pike, sir, a Sergeant with the Stariksa levies, cut off from his\ncompany in the battle.” The lies spilled out of West’s mouth with a\nsurprising ease. “He and a girl, I believe a cook’s daughter who was with\nthe baggage, joined us on the way north. He has been a great help, sir, a\ngood man in a tight spot. Wouldn’t have made it without him.”\n“Excellent!” said Burr, walking over to the convict and seizing his hand.\n“Well done. Your regiment is gone, Pike. Not many survivors, I’m sorry to\nsay. Damn few survivors, but I can always use trustworthy men here at my\nheadquarters. Especially ones who are good in a tight spot.” He gave a long\nsigh. “I have few enough of ’em to hand. I hope that you’ll agree to stay\nwith us.”\nThe convict swallowed. “Of course, Lord Marshal, it would be an\nhonour.”\n“What about Prince Ladisla?” murmured Burr.\nWest took a deep breath and looked down at the ground. “Prince\nLadisla…” He trailed off and slowly shook his head. “Horsemen surprised\nus, and overran the headquarters. It happened so fast… I looked for him\nafterwards, but…”\n“I see. Well. There it is. He should never have been in command, but\nwhat could I do? I’m only in charge of the damn army!” He laid a fatherly\nhand on West’s shoulder. “Don’t blame yourself. I know you did everything\nyou could.”\nWest dared not look up.

He wondered what Burr would have said had he\nknown what really happened, out there in the cold wilderness. “Have there\nbeen any other survivors?”\n“A handful. No more than a handful, and a sorry one at that.” Burr\nburped, grimaced, and rubbed at his gut. “I must apologise. Damn\nindigestion simply will not go away. Food up here and all… ugh.” He\nburped again.\n“Forgive me, sir, but what is our situation?”\n“Right to business, eh, West? I always liked that about you. Right to\nbusiness. Well, I’ll be honest. When I received your letter, we planned to\nhead back south to cover Ostenhorm, but the weather has been dire and\nwe’ve scarcely been able to move. The Northmen seem to be everywhere!\nBethod may have had the bulk of his army near the Cumnur, but he left\nenough up here to make things damned difficult for us. We’ve had constant\nraids against our lines of supply, more than one pointless and bloody\nskirmish, and a chaotic nighttime action which almost caused full-scale\npanic in Kroy’s division.”\nPoulder and Kroy. Unpleasant memories began to crowd back into\nWest’s mind, and the simple physical discomforts of the journey north\nbegan to seem rather appealing. “How are the Generals?”\nBurr glared up from under his heavy eyebrows. “Could you believe me\nif I said they were worse than ever? You can scarcely put the two in the\nsame room without them starting to bicker. I have to have briefings with\neach on alternate days, so as to avoid fisticuffs in my headquarters. A\nludicrous state of affairs!” He gripped his hands behind him as he strode\ngrimly round the tent. “But the damage they’re doing pales compared to the\ndamn cold. There are men down with frostbite, with fever, with scurvy, the\nsick tents are brimming. For every man the enemy have killed we’ve lost\ntwenty to the winter, and those still walking have got precious little stomach\nleft for a fight. As for scouting, hah! Don’t get me started!” He slapped\nangrily at the maps on the table. “Charts of the land up here are all works of\nimagination. Useless, and we’ve barely any skilled scouts at all. Mist every\nday, and snow, and we can’t see from one side of the camp to the other!\nHonestly, West, we’ve not the slightest idea where Bethod’s main body is\nright now—”\n“He’s to the south, sir, perhaps two days’ march behind us.”\nBurr’s brows went up. “He is?”\n“He is. Threetrees and his Northmen kept them under close watch as we\nmoved, and even arranged a few unpleasant surprises for some of their\noutriders.”\n“Like the one that they gave us, eh, West? Rope across the road and all\nthat?” He chuckled to himself. “Two days’ march behind, you say? This is\nuseful information.

This is damn useful!” Burr winced and put one hand on\nhis gut as he moved back to his table, picking up a ruler and starting to\nmeasure out distances. “Two days’ march. That would put him somewhere\nhere. You’re sure?”\n“I’m sure, Lord Marshal.”\n“If he’s heading for Dunbrec, he’ll pass near General Poulder’s position.\nIt might be that we can bring him to battle before he gets round us, perhaps\neven give him a surprise he won’t forget. Well done, West, well done!” He\ntossed his ruler down. “Now you should get some rest.”\n“I’d rather get straight back into it, sir—”\n“I know, and I could use you, but take a day or two in any case, the\nworld won’t end. You’ve come through quite an ordeal.”\nWest swallowed. He did feel terribly tired all of a sudden. “Of course. I\nshould write a letter… to my sister.” It was strange saying it. He had not\nthought about her for weeks. “I should let her know that I’m… alive.”\n“Good idea. I’ll send for you, Colonel, when I need you.” And Burr\nturned away and hunched back over his charts.\n“I won’t forget that,” whispered Pike in West’s ear as he lurched back\nthrough the flap into the cold.\n“It’s nothing. They won’t miss either one of you at that camp. It’s\nSergeant Pike again, is all. You can put your mistakes behind you.”\n“I won’t forget it. I’m your man, now, Colonel, whatever happens. Your\nman!” West nodded as he made off, frowning, through the snow. War killed\na lot of men, it seemed. But it gave a few a second chance.\nW\nest paused on the threshold. He could hear voices inside, chuckling. Old,\nfamiliar voices. They should have made him feel safe, warm, welcomed,\nbut they did not. They worried him. Scared him, even. They, surely, would\nknow. They would point and scream. “Murderer! Traitor! Villain!” He\nturned back towards the cold. Snow was settling gently over the camp. The\nclosest tents were black on the white ground, the ones behind grey. Further\nback they were soft ghosts, then only dim suggestions through the flurry of\ntiny flakes. No one moved. All was quiet. He took a deep breath and pushed\nthrough the flap.\nThe three officers were sat around a flimsy folding table inside, pushed\nclose up to a glowing stove. Jalenhorm’s beard had grown to shovel-like\nproportions. Kaspa had a red scarf wrapped round his head. Brint was\nswaddled in a dark greatcoat, dealing cards out to the other two.\n“Close that flap, damn it, it’s freezing out—” Jalenhorm’s jaw dropped.\n“No! It can’t be! Colonel West!”\nBrint leaped up as though he had been bitten on the arse. “Shit!”\n“I told you!” shouted Kaspa, flinging down his cards and grinning\nmadly. “I told you he’d be back!”\nThey surrounded him, clapping his back, squeezing his hands, pulling\nhim into the tent. No manacles, no drawn swords, no accusations of treason."

No manacles, no drawn swords, no accusations of treason.\nJalenhorm conducted him to the best chair, meaning the one furthest from\nimminent collapse, while Kaspa breathed into a glass and wiped it clean\nwith his finger and Brint pulled the cork from the bottle with a gentle\nthwop.\n“When did you get here?”\n“How did you get here?”\n“Were you with Ladisla?”\n“Were you at the battle?”\n“Hold on,” said Jalenhorm, “give him a minute!”\nWest waved him down. “I got here this morning, and would have come\nto you at once apart from a crucial meeting with a bath and a razor, and then\none with Marshal Burr. I was with Ladisla, at the battle, and I got here by\nwalking across country, with the help of five Northmen, a girl, and a man\nwith no face.” He took the glass and gulped down the contents in one go,\nwinced and sucked his teeth as the spirit burned its way down into his\nstomach, already starting to feel glad that he decided to come in. “Don’t be\nshy,” he said as he held the empty glass out.\n“Walking across country,” whispered Brint, shaking his head as he\npoured, “with five Northmen. A girl, you say?”\n“That’s right.” West frowned, wondering what Cathil was doing right\nnow. Wondering whether she needed help… foolishness, she could look\nafter herself. “You made it with my letter, then, Lieutenant?” he asked\nJalenhorm.\n“Some cold and nervous nights on the road,” grinned the big man, “but I\ndid.”\n“Except that it’s Captain now,” said Kaspa, sitting back on his stool.\n“Is it indeed?”\nJalenhorm shrugged modestly. “Thanks to you, really. The Lord Marshal\nput me on his staff when I got back.”\n“Though Captain Jalenhorm still finds time to spend with us little\npeople, bless him.” Brint licked his fingertips and started dealing four\nhands.\n“I’ve no stake, I’m afraid,” muttered West.\nKaspa grinned. “Don’t worry, Colonel, we don’t play for money any\nmore. Without Luthar to make poor men of us all, it hardly seemed worth\nit.”\n“He never turned up?”\n“They just came and pulled him off the boat. Hoff sent for him. We’ve\nheard nothing since.”\n“Friends in high places,” said Brint sourly. “Probably swanning about in\nAdua on some easy detail, making free with the women while the rest of us\nare freezing our arses off.”\n“Though let’s be honest,” threw in Jalenhorm. “He made free enough\nwith the women even when we were there.”\nWest frowned. That was all too unfortunately true.\nKaspa scraped his hand up off the table. “So anyway, we’re just playing\nfor honour.”\n“Though you’ll not find much of that here,” quipped Brint.

He swilled down the next glass and reached for the bottle.\n“Well, I’ll tell you one thing,” Jalenhorm was saying, sorting his cards\nwith fumbling fingers, “I’m glad as all hell that I won’t have to tell your\nsister anything for you. I’ve scarcely slept in weeks for thinking through\nhow I’d go about it, and I still haven’t got a thought in my head.”\n“You’ve never yet had a thought in your head,” said Brint, and the other\ntwo chortled away again. Even West managed a smile this time, but it didn’t\nlast long.\n“How was the battle?” asked Jalenhorm.\nWest stared at his glass for a long moment. “It was bad. The Northmen\nset a trap for Ladisla and he fell right into it, squandered his cavalry. Then a\nmist came up, all of a sudden, and you couldn’t see the hand before your\nface. Their horses were on us before we knew what was happening. I took a\nknock on the head, I think. Next I remember I was in the mud on my back\nand there was a Northman bearing down on me. With this.” He slid the\nheavy sword out of his belt and laid it down on the table.\nThe three officers stared at it, spellbound. “Bloody hell,” muttered\nKaspa.\nBrint’s eyes were wide. “How did you get the better of him?”\n“I didn’t. This girl I was telling you about…”\n“Yes?”\n“She smashed his brains out with a hammer. Saved my life.”\n“Bloody hell,” muttered Kaspa.\n“Phew,” Brint sat back heavily in his chair. “Sounds like quite a\nwoman!”\nWest was frowning, staring down at the glass in his hand. “You could\nsay that.” He remembered the feeling of Cathil sleeping beside him, her\nbreath against his cheek. Quite a woman. “You really could say that.” He\ndrained his glass and stood up, stuck the Northman’s sword back through\nhis belt.\n“You’re going?” asked Brint.\n“There’s something I need to take care of.”\nJalenhorm stood up with him. “I should thank you, Colonel. For sending\nme off with the letter. It sounds like you were right. There was nothing I\ncould have done.”\n“No.” West took a deep breath, and blew it out. “There was nothing\nanyone could have done.”\nT\nhe night was still, and crisp, and cold, and West’s boots slipped and\nsquelched in the half-frozen mud. Fires burned here and there and men\nclustered round them in the darkness, swaddled in all the clothes they\npossessed, breath smoking, pinched faces lit in flickering yellow. One fire\nburned brighter than the others, up on a slope above the camp, and West\nmade for that now, feet weaving from the drink.

Somewhere away to the right, off in the\ndarkness, West could hear someone singing in Northern. A huge, deep\nvoice, and singing very badly. “He cut him to the boooones. No. To the\nboooones. To the… wait on.”\n“You alright?” asked West, holding his gloved hands out to the crackling\nflames.\nThreetrees grinned happily up at him, wobbling slightly back and\nforward. West wondered if it was the first time he had seen the old warrior\nsmile. He jerked a thumb down the hill. “Tul’s having a piss. And singing.\nI’m drunk as fucking shit.” He fell slowly backwards and crunched down\ninto the snow, arms and legs spread out wide. “And I been smoking. I’m\nsoaked. I’m wet as the fucking Crinna. Where are we, Dow?”\nDow squinted across the fire, mouth wide open, like he was looking at\nsomething far away. “Middle o’ fucking nowhere,” he said, waving the pipe\naround. He started cackling, grabbed hold of Threetrees’ boot, and shook it.\n“Where else would we be? You want this, Furious?” He thrust the pipe up at\nWest.\n“Alright.” He sucked on the stem, felt the smoke biting in his lungs. He\ncoughed brown steam out into the frosty air, and sucked again.\n“Give me that,” said Threetrees, sitting up and snatching the pipe off\nhim.\nTul’s great, rumbling voice came floating up out of the darkness,\nhorribly out of tune. “He swung his axe like… what is it? He swung his axe\nlike… shit. No. Hold on…”\n“Do you know where Cathil is?” asked West.\nDow leered up at him. “Oh, she’s around.” He waved his hand toward a\ncluster of tents higher up the slope. “Up that way, I reckon.”\n“Around,” echoed Threetrees, chuckling softly. “Around.”\n“He was… the Bloody… Niiiiine!” came gurgling from the trees.\nWest followed footprints off up the slope, towards the tents. The smoke\nwas already having an effect on him. His head felt light, his feet moved\neasily. His nose didn’t feel cold any more, just pleasantly tingling. He heard\na woman’s voice, laughing softly. He grinned, took a few more crunching\nsteps through the snow towards the tents. Warm light spilled out from one,\nthrough a narrow gap in the cloth. The laughter grew louder.\n“Uh… uh… uh…”\nWest frowned. That didn’t sound like laughter. He came closer, doing his\nbest to be quiet. Another sound wandered into his fuzzy mind. An\nintermittent growling, like some kind of animal. He edged closer still,\nbending down to peer through the gap, hardly daring even to breathe.\n“Uh… uh… uh…”\nHe saw a woman’s bare back, squirming up and down.

A pair of sinewy legs stuck out from under her towards\nWest, one foot almost close enough for him to touch, its thick toes\nwriggling.\n“Uh… uh… uh…”\nA hand slid up under her armpit, another round behind one knee. There\nwas a low growl and the lovers, if you could call them that, rolled smoothly\nover so she was underneath. West’s mouth dropped open. He could see the\nside of the man’s head, and he stared at it. There was no mistaking the\nsharp, stubbly jaw line. The Dogman. His arse was sticking up towards\nWest, moving in and out. Cathil’s hand clutched at one hairy buttock,\nsqueezing at it in time to the movement.\n“Uh… Uh… Uh!”\nWest clamped one hand over his mouth, eyes bulging, half-horrified,\nhalf strangely aroused. He was caught hopelessly between wanting to watch\nand wanting to run, and came down on the latter without thinking. He took\na step back, his heel caught a tent peg, and he went sprawling over with a\nstifled cry.\n“What the fuck?” he heard from inside the tent. He scrambled up and\nturned away, started to flounder through the snow in the darkness as he\nheard the flap thrown back. “Which of you is it, you bastards?” came\nDogman’s voice from above, bellowing in Northern. “That you, Dow? I’ll\nfucking kill you!”\nThe High Places\nT\nhe Broken Mountains,” breathed Brother Longfoot, his voice hushed\nwith awe. “Truly, a magnificent sight.”\n“I think I’d like it better if I didn’t have to climb ’em,” grunted Logen.\nJezal by no means disagreed. The character of the land they rode\nthrough had been changing day by day, from softly sloping grassland, to\ngently rolling plains, to buckled hills spattered with bare rocks and sullen\ngroups of stunted trees. Always in the distance had been the dim grey\nrumours of the mountain peaks, growing larger and more distinct with each\nmorning until they seemed to pierce the brooding clouds themselves.\nNow they sat in their very shadow. The long valley they had been\nfollowing with its waving trees and winding stream ended at a maze of\nbroken walls. Beyond it lay a steep rise into the rugged foothills, beyond\nthem the first true outlier of the mountains rose, a stark outline of jagged\nrock, proud and magnificent, smeared at the distant top with white snow. A\nchild’s vertiginous notion of what a mountain should be.\nBayaz swept the ruined foundations with his hard green eyes. “There\nwas a strong fortress here. It marked the western limits of the Empire,\nbefore pioneers crossed the pass and settled the valleys on the far side.” The\nplace was nothing more now than a home for stinging weeds and scratching\nbrambles.

The Magus clambered from the cart and squatted down,\nstretching out his back and working his legs, grimacing all the while. He\nstill looked old and ill, but a great deal of both flesh and colour had returned\nto his face since they left Aulcus behind. “Here ends my rest,” he sighed.\n“This cart has served us well, and the beasts too, but the pass will be too\nsteep for horses.”\nJezal saw the track now, switching back and forth as it climbed, a faint\nline through the piles of wild grass and steep rock, lost over a ridge high\nabove. “It looks a long way.”\nBayaz snorted. “But the first ascent of many we will make today, and\nthere will be many more beyond them. We will be a week at least in the\nmountains, my boy, if all goes well.” Jezal hardly dared ask what might\nhappen if things went badly. “We must travel light. We have a long, steep\nroad to follow. Water and all the food we have left. Warm clothes, for it will\nbe bitter cold among the peaks.”\n“The birth of spring is perhaps not the best time to cross a mountain\nrange,” observed Longfoot under his breath.\nBayaz looked sharply sideways. “Some would say the best time to cross\nan obstacle is when one finds oneself on the wrong side of it! Or do you\nsuggest we wait for summer?” The Navigator chose, wisely in Jezal’s\nopinion, not to reply. “The pass is well sheltered in the main, the weather\nshould be far from our most pressing worry. We will need ropes, though.\nThe road was good, in the Old Time, if narrow, but that was long ago. It\nmight have been washed away in places, or tumbled into deep valleys, who\nknows? We may have some tough climbing ahead of us.”\n“I can hardly wait,” muttered Jezal.\n“Then there is this.” The Magus pulled one of the nearly empty fodder\nsacks open, pushed the hay out of the way with his bony hands. The box\nthey had taken from the House of the Maker lay in its bottom, a block of\ndarkness among the pale, dry grass.\n“And who gets the joy of carrying that bastard?” Logen looked up from\nunder his brows. “How about we draw lots? No?” No one said anything.\nThe Northman grunted as he hooked his hands under it and dragged it off\nthe cart towards him, its edge squealing against the wood. “Reckon it’s me,\nthen,” he said, thick veins standing out from his neck as he hauled the\nweighty thing onto a blanket.\nJezal did not at all enjoy looking at it. It reminded him too much of the\nsuffocating hallways of the Maker’s House. Of Bayaz’s dark stories about\nmagic, and demons, and the Other Side. Of the fact that there was a purpose\nto this journey that he did not understand, but definitely did not like the\nsound of. He was glad when Logen finally had it wrapped up in blankets\nand stowed in a pack. Out of sight at least, if not entirely out of mind."

Jezal took his steels, of course, sheathed at\nhis belt. The clothes he wore: the least stained, torn, and reeking he\npossessed, his ripped and battered, one-armed coat over the top. He had a\nspare shirt in his pack, a coil of rope above it, and half their stock of food\non top of that. He almost wished that were heavier: They were down to their\nlast box of biscuits, half a sack of oatmeal, and a packet of salted fish that\ndisgusted everyone except Quai. He rolled up a pair of blankets and belted\nthem to the top of his pack, hung a full canteen at his waist, and was ready\nto go. As ready as he was going to get, anyway.\nQuai unhitched the cart horses while Jezal stripped the saddles and\nharnesses from the other two. It seemed hardly fair, leaving them in the\nmiddle of nowhere after they had carried them all the way from Calcis. It\nfelt like years ago to Jezal, thinking back. He was a different man now from\nthe one who had set out from that city across the plain. He almost winced to\nremember his arrogance, and his ignorance, and his selfishness.\n“Yah!” he shouted. His horse looked at him sadly without moving, then\nput its head down and began to nibble at the grass near his feet. He rubbed\nits back fondly. “Well. I suppose they will find their way in time.”\n“Or not,” grunted Ferro, drawing her sword.\n“What are you—”\nThe curved blade chopped halfway through the neck of Jezal’s horse,\nspattering warm, wet specks in his stricken face. Its front legs crumpled and\nit slid to the ground, toppled onto its side, blood gushing out into the grass.\nFerro grabbed hold of one of its hooves, hauled it towards her with one\nhand, and started hacking the leg from the carcass with short, efficient\nblows while Jezal stared, his mouth open. She scowled up at him.\n“I am not leaving all this meat for the birds. It will not keep long, but we\nwill eat well enough tonight, at least. Get that sack.”\nLogen flung one of the empty feed bags to her, and shrugged. “You can’t\nget attached to things, Jezal. Not out here in the wild.”\nNo one spoke as they began to climb. They all were bent over and\nconcentrating on the crumbling track beneath their shuffling feet. The path\nrose and turned back, rose and turned back, time after time and soon Jezal’s\nlegs were aching, his shoulders were sore, his face was damp with sweat.\nOne step at a time. That was what West used to tell him, when he was\nflagging on the long runs round the Agriont. One step at a time, and he had\nbeen right.

It was\namazing, how high they had climbed in so short a time. He could see the\nfoundations of the ruined fortress, grey outlines in the green turf at the foot\nof the pass. Beyond it the rutted track led back through the crumpled hills\ntowards Aulcus. Jezal gave a sudden shudder and turned back towards the\nmountains. Better to leave all that behind him.\nL\nogen slogged up the steep path, his worn boots scraping and crunching in\nthe gravel and the dirt, the metal box in his pack a deadweight that dragged\non his shoulders and seemed to get heavier with each step, that dug into his\nflesh like a bag of nails even though it was wrapped in blankets. But Logen\nwas not so very bothered by it. He was too busy watching Ferro’s arse move\nas she walked ahead of him, lean muscles squeezing with every step under\nthe stained canvas of her trousers.\nIt was an odd thing. Before he’d fucked her he hadn’t thought about her\nthat way at all. He’d been too concerned with trying to stop her running off,\nor shooting him, or stabbing one of the others. So busy watching her scowl\nthat he hadn’t seen her face. So busy watching her hands that he’d never\nnoticed the rest of her. Now he couldn’t think about anything else.\nEvery movement of hers seemed fascinating. He’d catch himself\nwatching her all the time. While they were on the move. While they were\nsitting down. While she was eating, or drinking, or talking, or spitting.\nWhile she was pulling her boots on in the morning or pulling them off at\nnight. To make matters worse, his cock was halfway hard the whole time\nfrom watching her out of the corners of his eyes, and imagining her naked.\nIt was getting to be quite an embarrassment.\n“What are you looking at?” Logen stopped and gazed up into the sun.\nFerro was frowning down at him. He stood and shifted the pack on his\nback, rubbing at his sore shoulders, wiping a sheen of sweat from his\nforehead. He could’ve thought up a lie, easily enough. He’d been watching\nthe magnificent mountain peaks. He’d been watching where he put his feet.\nHe’d been checking that her pack was on right. But what would’ve been the\npoint? They both knew well enough what he’d been looking at, and the\nothers had pushed on well out of earshot.\n“I’m looking at your arse,” he said, shrugging his shoulders. “Sorry, but\nit’s a good one. No harm looking, is there?”\nShe opened her mouth angrily, but he put his head down and trudged\nround her before she had the chance to speak, his thumbs hooked under the\nstraps of his pack. When he’d got ten paces or so, he looked over his\nshoulder. She was still standing there, hands on her hips, frowning up at\nhim. He grinned back.\n“What are you looking at?” he said.\nT\nhey stopped for water in the cold, fresh morning, on a ledge above a\nplunging valley.

        "text": "hey stopped for water in the cold, fresh morning, on a ledge above a\nplunging valley. Through spreading trees heavy with red berries growing\nsideways from the bare rock, Jezal could see white water surging in its\nnarrow bottom. Dizzying cliffs rose on the far side, sheets of grey stone not\nfar from sheer, ending in towering crags high above, where dark birds\nflapped and crowed to each other, while swirls of white cloud turned in the\npale sky beyond. A spectacular setting, if somewhat unsettling.\n“Beautiful,” murmured Jezal, but taking care not to get too close to the\nedge.\nLogen nodded. “Reminds me of home. When I was a lad, I used to\nspend weeks at a time up in the High Places, testing myself against the\nmountains.” He took a swallow from the flask, then handed it to Jezal,\nstaring up through narrowed eyes at the dark peaks. “They always win,\nthough. This Empire’s come and gone, and here they still are, looking down\non it all. Here they’ll still be, long after all of us have gone back to the mud.\nThey looked down on my home.” He gave a long snort, then spat phlegm\nover the edge of the valley. “Now they look down on nothing.”\nJezal took a swallow of water himself. “Will you go back to the North,\nafter this?”\n“Maybe. I’ve some scores to settle. Some deep, hard scores.” The\nNorthman shrugged his shoulders. “But if I let ’em lie, I daresay no one\nwould be the worse off. I reckon they all think I’m dead, and no one’s\nanything but relieved about it.”\n“Nothing to go back to?”\nLogen winced. “Nothing but more blood. My family’s long dead and\nrotted, and those friends I didn’t turn on and kill myself, I got killed with\nmy pride and my stupidity. So much for my achievements. But you’ve still\ngot time, eh, Jezal? A good chance at a nice, peaceful life. What will you\ndo?”\n“Well… I’ve been thinking.…” He cleared his throat, suddenly nervous,\nas though giving voice to his plans made them far closer to reality. “There’s\na girl back home… well, a woman, I suppose. My friend’s sister, in fact…\nher name is Ardee. I think that, perhaps, I love her.…” It was strange that he\nwas discussing his innermost feelings with this man he had thought a\nsavage. With this man who could understand nothing of the delicate rules of\nlife in the Union, of the sacrifice that Jezal was considering. But somehow it\nwas easy to say. “I’ve been thinking… well… if she’ll have me, perhaps…\nwe might marry.”\n“That sounds like a good plan.” Logen grinned and nodded. “Marry her,\nand sow some seeds.”\nJezal raised his eyebrows. “I don’t know much about farming.”\nThe Northman spluttered with laughter. “Not those kinds of seeds, boy!”\nHe clapped him on the arm. “One piece of advice, though, if you’ll take one\nfrom the likes of me. Find something to do with your life that don’t involve\nkilling.” He bent and swung up his pack, shoved his arms through the"

Find something to do with your life that don’t involve\nkilling.” He bent and swung up his pack, shoved his arms through the\nstraps. “Leave the fighting to those with less sense.” And he turned and\nstruggled up the track.\nJezal nodded slowly to himself. He touched one hand to the scar on his\nchin, his tongue finding the hole in his teeth. Logen was right. Fighting was\nnot the life for him. He already had one scar too many.\nI\nt was a bright day. The first time Ferro had been warm in a long while, and\nthe sun felt good, hot and angry on her face, on her bare forearms, on the\nbacks of her hands. The shadows of rock and branch were laid out sharp on\nthe stony ground, the spray from the falling water that flowed beside the old\ntrack flashed as it fell through the air.\nThe others had fallen behind. Longfoot, taking his time, smiling up at\nanything and everything, blathering on about the majesty of the views. Quai\nhunched up and dogged under the weight of his pack. Bayaz wincing and\nsweating, puffing as though he might fall dead at any minute. Luthar\nmoaning about his blisters to anyone who would listen, which was no one.\nSo it was only her and Ninefingers, striding up ahead in stony silence.\nJust the way she liked it.\nShe scrambled over a lip of crumbling rock and came upon a dark pool,\nlapping at a crescent of flat stones, water hissing and splattering down into\nit over piled-up rocks bearded with wet moss. A pair of twisted trees spread\ntheir branches out above, thin, fresh-budded leaves shimmering and rustling\nin the breeze. The sunlight sparkled, and insects skated and buzzed lazily on\nthe rippling water.\nA beautiful place, most likely, if you thought that way.\nFerro did not. “Fish in there,” she murmured, licking her lips. A fish\nwould be nice, stuck on a twig over a fire. The bits of horse they had carried\nwith them were all gone, and she was hungry. She watched the vague\nshapes flicker under the shimmering water as she squatted down to fill up\nher canteen. Lots of fish. Ninefingers dumped his heavy pack and sat down\non the rocks beside it, dragging his boots off. He rolled his trousers up\nabove his knees. “What are you doing, pink?”\nHe grinned at her. “I’m going to tickle me some fish out of that pool.”\n“With your hands? You got clever enough fingers for that?”\n“I reckon you’d know.” She frowned at him, but he only smiled the\nwider, skin creasing up round the corners of his eyes. “Watch and learn,\nwoman.” And he paddled out, bent over, lips pressed tight together with\nconcentration, feeling gently around in the water.\n“What’s he up to?” Luthar dumped his pack down beside Ferro’s and\nwiped his glistening face with the back of his hand.\n“Fool thinks he can catch a fish.”\n“What, with his hands?”\n“Watch and learn, boy,” muttered Ninefingers. “Aaaah…” His face\nbroke out into a smile. “And here she is.” The muscles in his forearm"

Something flashed in the bright sun and he\ntossed it onto the bank beside them, leaving a trail of dark wet spots on the\ndry stones. A fish, flipping and jumping.\n“Hah hah!” cried Longfoot, stepping up beside them. “Tricking fish out\nof the pool, is he? A most impressive and remarkable skill. I once met a\nman of the Thousand Isles who was reckoned the greatest fisherman in the\nCircle of the World. I do declare, he could sit upon the bank and sing, and\nthe fish would jump into his lap. They would indeed!” He frowned to find\nno one delighted by his tale, but now Bayaz was dragging himself over the\nlip, almost on hands and knees. His apprentice appeared behind him, face\nset hard.\nThe First of the Magi tottered down, leaning heavily on his staff, and fell\nback against a rock. “Perhaps… we should camp here.” He gasped for\nbreath, sweat running down his gaunt face. “You would never guess I once\nran through this pass. I made it in two days.” He let his staff drop from his\ntrembling fingers and it clattered down amongst the dry, grey driftwood\nnear the water’s edge. “Long ago…”\n“I’ve been thinking…” muttered Luthar.\nBayaz’s tired eyes swivelled sideways, as though even turning his head\nmight prove too much of an effort. “Thinking and walking? Pray do not\nstrain yourself, Captain Luthar.”\n“Why the edge of the World?”\nThe Magus frowned. “Not for the exercise, I assure you. What we seek\nis there.”\n“Yes, but why is it there?”\n“Uh,” grunted Ferro in agreement. A good question.\nBayaz took a long breath and puffed out his cheeks. “Never any rest, eh?\nAfter the destruction of Aulcus, the fall of Glustrod, the three remaining\nsons of Euz met. Juvens, Bedesh, and Kanedias. They discussed what\nshould be done… with the Seed.”\n“Have that!” shouted Ninefingers, pulling another fish from the water\nand flinging it onto the stones beside the first. Bayaz watched it,\nexpressionless, as it squirmed and flopped, mouth and gills gulping\ndesperately at the suffocating air.\n“Kanedias desired to study it. He claimed he could turn it to righteous\npurposes. Juvens feared the stone, but knew of no way to destroy it, so he\ngave it into his brother’s keeping. Over long years, though, as the wounds\nof the Empire failed to heal, he came to regret his decision. He worried that\nKanedias, hungry for power, might break the First Law as Glustrod had\ndone. He demanded the stone be put beyond use. At first the Maker refused,\nand the trust between the brothers dwindled. I know this, for I was the one\nwho carried the messages between them.

Even then, I learned since, they\nwere preparing the weapons that they would one day use against each other.\nJuvens begged, then pleaded, then threatened, and eventually Kanedias\nrelented. So the three sons of Euz journeyed to Shabulyan.”\n“No place more remote in the whole Circle of the World,” muttered\nLongfoot.\n“That is why it was chosen. They gave up the Seed to the spirit of the\nisland, to keep safe until the end of time.”\n“They commanded the spirit never to release it,” murmured Quai.\n“My apprentice shows his ignorance again,” returned Bayaz, glaring\nfrom under his bushy brows. “Not never, Master Quai. Juvens was wise\nenough to know that he could not guess all outcomes. He realised that a\ndesperate time might come, in some future age, when the power of… this\nthing might be needed. So Bedesh commanded the spirit to release it only to\na man who carried Juvens’ staff.”\nLongfoot frowned. “Then where is it?”\nBayaz pointed to the length of wood he used for a stick, lying on the\nground beside him, rough and unadorned. “That’s it?” muttered Luthar,\nsounding more than a little disappointed.\n“What did you expect, Captain?” Bayaz grinned sideways at him. “Ten\nfeet of polished gold, inlaid with runes of crystal, topped by a diamond the\nsize of your head?” The Magus snorted. “Even I have never seen a gem that\nbig. A simple stick was good enough for my master. He needed nothing\nmore. A length of wood does not by itself make a man wise, or noble, or\npowerful, any more than a length of steel does. Power comes from the flesh,\nmy boy, and from the heart, and from the head. From the head most of all.”\n“I love this pool!” cackled Ninefingers, tossing another fish out onto the\nrocks.\n“Juvens,” murmured Longfoot softly, “and his brothers, powerful\nbeyond guessing, between men and gods. Even they feared this thing. They\nwent to such pains to put it beyond use. Should we not fear it, as they did?”\nBayaz stared at Ferro, his eyes glittering, and she stared back. Beads of\nsweat stood out from his wrinkled skin, darkened the hairs of his beard, but\nhis face was flat as a closed door. “Weapons are dangerous, to those who do\nnot understand them. With Ferro Maljinn’s bow I might shoot myself in the\nfoot, if I did not know how to use it. With Captain Luthar’s steel I might cut\nmy ally, had I not the skill. The greater the weapon, the greater the danger. I\nhave the proper respect for this thing, believe me, but to fight our enemies,\nwe need a powerful weapon indeed.”\nFerro frowned. She was yet to be convinced that her enemies and his\nwere quite the same, but she would let it sleep, for now. She had come too\nfar, and got too close, not to see this business through. She glanced over at\nNinefingers and caught him staring at her. His eyes flicked away, back to"

She frowned deeper. He was always looking at her lately. Staring,\nand grinning, and making bad jokes. And now she found herself looking at\nhim more often than there was any need for. Patterns of light flowed across\nhis face, reflected from the rippling water. He looked up again, and their\neyes met, and he grinned at her, just for an instant.\nFerro’s frown grew deeper yet. She pulled her knife out, snatched up one\nof the fish, and took its head off, slit it open, and flicked its slimy guts out,\nplopping down into the water next to Ninefingers’ leg. It had been a mistake\nto fuck him, of course, but things had not turned out so very badly after all.\n“Hah!” Ninefingers sent up another glittering spray of water, then he\nstumbled, clutching at the air. “Ah!” The fish flapped from his hands, a\nstreak of flipping brightness, and the Northman crashed into the water on\nhis face. He came up spitting and shaking his head, hair plastered to his\nskull. “Bastard!”\n“Every man has, somewhere in the world, an adversary cleverer than\nhimself.” Bayaz stretched out his legs in front of him. “Could it be, Master\nNinefingers, that you have finally found yours?”\nJ\nezal woke with a start. It was the middle of the night. It took him a dizzy\nmoment to remember where he was, for he had been dreaming of home, of\nthe Agriont, of sunny days and balmy evenings. Of Ardee, or someone like\nher, smiling lop-sided at him in his cosy living room. Now the stars were\nscattered bright and stark across the black sky, and the chill, sharp air of the\nHigh Places nipped at Jezal’s lips, and his nostrils, and the tips of his ears.\nHe was back up in the Broken Mountains, half the width of the world\nfrom Adua, and he felt a pang of loss. At least his stomach was full. Fish\nand biscuit, the first proper meal he’d eaten since the horse ran out. There\nwas still warmth from the fire on the side of his face and he turned towards\nit, grinning at the glowing embers and dragging his blankets up under his\nchin. Happiness was nothing more than a fresh fish and a fire still alight.\nHe frowned. The blankets beside him, where Logen had been sleeping,\nwere moving around. At first he took it for the Northman turning in his\nsleep, but they carried on moving, and did not stop. A slow, regular shifting,\naccompanied, Jezal now realised, by a soft grunting sound. He had taken it\nat first for Bayaz’s snoring, but now he saw otherwise. Straining into the\ndarkness, he made out Ninefingers’ pale shoulder and arm, thick muscles\nstraining. Under his arm, squeezing hard at his side, there was a dark-\nskinned hand.\nJezal’s mouth hung open. Logen and Ferro, and from the sound of it\nthere could be no doubt that they were coupling!

He stared, watching the blankets bucking and shifting\nin the dim light from the fire. When had they… Why were they… How had\nthey… It was a damned imposition is what it was! His old distaste for them\nflooded back in a moment and his scarred lip curled. A pair of savages,\nrutting in full view! He had half a mind to get up and kick them as you\nmight kick a pair of dogs who had, to the general embarrassment of all,\nunexpectedly taken to each other at a garden party.\n“Shit,” whispered a voice. Jezal froze, wondering if one of them had\nseen him.\n“Hold on.” There was a brief pause.\n“Ah… ah, that’s it.” The repetitive movement started up again, the\nblankets flapping back and forward, slowly to begin with, then faster. How\ncould they possibly have expected him to sleep through this? He scowled\nand rolled away, pulling his own covers over his head, and lay there in the\ndarkness, listening to Ninefingers’ throaty grunting and Ferro’s urgent\nhissing growing steadily louder. He squeezed his eyes shut, and felt a sting\nof tears underneath his lids.\nDamn it but he was lonely.\nComing Over\nT\nhe road curved down from the west, down the bare white valley between\ntwo long ridges, all covered in dark pines. It met the river at the ford, the\nWhiteflow running high with meltwater, fast flowing over the rocks and full\nof spit and froth—earning its name alright.\n“So that’s it then,” muttered Tul, lying on his belly and peering through\nthe bushes.\n“I reckon,” said Dogman, “’less there’s another giant fortress anywhere\non the river.”\nFrom up here, on the ridge, the Dogman could see its shape clear,\ntowering great walls of sheer dark stones, perfectly six-sided, twelve strides\nhigh at the least, a massive round tower at each corner, the grey slate roofs\nof buildings round a courtyard in the midst. Just outside that there was a\nsmaller wall, six sides again, half as high but still high enough, studded\nwith a dozen smaller towers. One side backed to the river, the other five had\na wide moat dug round them, so the whole thing was made an island of\nsharp stone. One bridge out to it, and one bridge only, stretching to a\ngatehouse the size of a hill.\n“Shit on that,” said Dow. “You ever seen walls the like of those? How\nthe hell did Bethod get in there?”\nDogman shook his head. “Don’t hardly matter how. He won’t fit his\nwhole army in it.”\n“He won’t want to,” said Threetrees. “Not Bethod. That’s not his way.\nHe’d rather be outside, where he can move, waiting for his chance to catch\n’em off guard.”\n“Uh,” grunted Grim, nodding.\n“Fucking Union!” cursed Dow. “They’re never on guard!

Bastard’s got one hell of a knack for turning up where he ain’t\nwanted.”\nDogman looked down at the fortress, and the river behind, and the long\nvalley, and the high ground on the other side, covered with trees. “He’ll\nhave men up on the ridge opposite, and down there in those woods round\nthe moat too, I shouldn’t wonder.”\n“Well, you got it all figured, don’t you?” said Dow, looking sideways.\n“There’s just one thing we still need to know. She suck your cock yet?”\n“What?” said the Dogman, caught not knowing what to say. Tul\nspluttered with laughter. Threetrees started chuckling to himself. Even Grim\nmade a kind of sound, like breath, but louder.\n“Simple question, ain’t it?” asked Dow. “Has she, or has she not, sucked\nit?”\nDogman frowned and hunched his shoulders. “Shit on that.”\nTul could barely hold his giggling back. “She did what to it? She shit on\nit? You was right, Dow, they don’t do it the same down there in the Union!”\nNow they were all laughing, apart from the Dogman of course.\n“Piss on the lot o’ you,” he grunted. “Maybe you should suck each\nother’s. At least it might shut you up.”\nDow slapped him on the shoulder. “Don’t think so. You know how Tul is\nfor talking with his mouth full!” Tul clamped his hand over his face and\nblew snot out of his nose, he was laughing so hard.

There was a footprint near him. Half in mud\nand half in snow. The snow was melting and falling, melting and falling off\nand on. A print wouldn’t have lasted long today. That meant it was made\nrecent. The Dogman sniffed the air. Not much to smell, but it was harder to\nsmell anything in the cold—nose all pink and numb and full of cold snot.\nHe crept the way the footprint was pointing, looking all round. He saw\nanother, and another. Someone had come this way, no doubt, and not long\nago.\n“You’re the Dogman, ain’t you.”\nHe froze, heart thumping like big boots upstairs all of a sudden. He\nturned round, to look where the voice came from. There was a man sitting\non a fallen tree ten strides away, lying back against a thick branch, hands\nclasped behind his head, stretched out like he was near asleep. He had long\nblack hair hanging in his face, but one eye peered out at the Dogman,\nwatchful. He sat forward, slowly.\n“Now, I’ll leave these here,” he said, pointing at a heavy axe half-buried\nin the rotten trunk, and a round shield leaning near it. “So you know I’m\nlooking to talk, and I’ll come on over. How’s that sound to you?”\nDogman raised his bow and drew the string back. “Come on over if you\nmust, but if you try more ’n talk, I’ll put an arrow through your neck.”\n“Fair enough.” Long Hair rocked himself forward and slithered off the\ntrunk, leaving his weapons behind, and came on through the trees. He\nwalked with his head stooped over, but he was a tall bastard still, holding\nhis hands up in the air, palms out. All peaceful-looking, no doubt, but the\nDogman wasn’t taking no chances. Peaceful-looking and peaceful are two\ndifferent things.\n“Might I say,” said the man as he came closer, “in the interests of\nworking up some trust between us, that you never saw me. If I’d had a bow,\nI could’ve shot you where you stood.” It was a fair point, but the Dogman\ndidn’t like it any.\n“You got a bow?”\n“No I don’t, as it goes.”\n“There’s your mistake, then,” he snapped. “You can stop there.”\n“I believe I will,” he said, standing a few strides distant.\n“So I’m the Dogman, and you know it. Who might you be?”\n“You remember Rattleneck, aye?”\n“Of course, but you ain’t him.”\n“No. I’m his son.”\nDogman frowned, and drew his bowstring back a touch tighter. “You’d\nbest make your next answer a damn good one. Ninefingers killed\nRattleneck’s son.”\n“That’s true. I’m his other son.”\n“But he was hardly more ’n a boy…” Dogman paused, counting the\nwinters in his head. “Shit. It’s that long ago?”\n“That long ago.”"

It’s that long ago?”\n“That long ago.”\n“You’ve grown some.”\n“That’s what boys do.”\n“You got a name now?”\n“Shivers, they call me.”\n“How come?”\nHe grinned. “Because my enemies shiver with fear when they face me.”\n“That so?”\n“Not entirely.” He sighed. “Might as well know now. First time I went\nout raiding, I got drunk and fell in the river having a piss. Current sucked\nmy trousers off and dumped me half a mile downstream. I got back to the\ncamp shivering worse than anyone had ever seen, fruits sucked right up into\nmy belly and everything.” He scratched at his face. “Bloody embarrassment\nall round. Made up for it in the fighting, though.”\n“Really?”\n“I got some blood on my fingers, over the years. Not compared to you, I\ndaresay, but enough for men to follow me.”\n“That so? How many?”\n“Two score Carls, or thereabouts. They’re not far away, but don’t get\nnervous. Some o’ my father’s people, from way back, and a few newer.\nGood hands, each man.”\n“Well, that’s nice for you, to have a little crew. Been fighting for Bethod,\nhave you?”\n“Man needs some kind o’ work. Don’t mean we wouldn’t take better.\nCan I put my hands down yet?”\n“No, I like ’em there. What you doing out here in the woods alone,\nanyhow?”\nShivers pursed his lips, thoughtful. “Don’t take me for a madman, but I\nheard a rumour you got Rudd Threetrees over here.”\n“That’s a fact.”\n“Is it now?”\n“And Tul Duru Thunderhead, and Harding Grim, and Black Dow an’\nall.”\nShivers raised his brows, leaned back against a tree, hands still up, while\nDogman watched him careful. “Well, that’s some weighty company you got\nthere, alright. There’s twice the blood on you five than on my two score.\nThose are some names and no mistake. The sort of names men might want\nto follow.”\n“You looking to follow?”\n“Might be that I am.”\n“And your Carls too?”\n“Them too.”\nIt was tempting, the Dogman had to admit. Two score Carls, and they’d\nknow where Bethod was at, maybe something of what he’d got planned.\nThat’d save him some skulking around in the cold woods, and he was\ngetting good and tired of wet trees. But he was a long way off trusting this\ntall bastard yet. He’d take him back to the camp, and Threetrees could\nweigh up what to do. “Alright,” he said, “we’ll see. Why don’t you step off\nup the hill there, and I’ll follow on a few paces behind.”\n“Alright,” said Shivers, turning and trudging up the slope, hands still up\nin the air, “but watch what you do with that shaft, eh? I don’t want to get\nstuck for you not looking where you’re stepping.”"

Dogman ended up on his knees in the dirt, looking up at him\nlooming over, clutching an empty bow in one hand. “Piss,” he muttered. If\nthe man had wanted to, Dogman had no doubt he could have swung one of\nthose big fists down and knocked his head off.\n“Lucky you missed me,” said Shivers. “Can I put my hands down now?”\nD\now started as soon as they walked into the camp, of course. “Who the\nhell’s this bastard?” he snarled, striding straight up to Shivers and staring\nhim out, bristling up to him with his axe clutched in his hand. It might have\nlooked a touch comical, Dow being half a head shorter, but Shivers didn’t\nseem much amused. Nor should he have.\n“He’s—” the Dogman started, but he didn’t get any further.\n“He’s a tall bastard, eh? I ain’t talking up to a bastard like him! Sit\ndown, big lad!” and he threw his arm out and shoved Shivers over on his\narse.\nThe Dogman thought he took it well, considering. He grunted when he\nhit the dirt, of course, then he blinked, then he propped himself on his\nelbows, grinning up at them. “I reckon I’ll just stay down here. Don’t hold\nit against me, though, eh? I didn’t choose to be tall, any more than you\nchose to be an arsehole.”\nDogman winced at that, expecting Shivers to get a boot in the fruits for\nhis trouble, but Dow started to grin instead. “Chose to be an arsehole, I like\nthat. I like him. Who is he?”\n“His name’s Shivers,” said the Dogman. “He’s Rattleneck’s son.”\nDow frowned. “But didn’t Ninefingers—”\n“His other son.”\n“But he’d be no more ’n a—”\n“Work it out.”\nDow frowned, then shook his head. “Shit. That long, eh?”\n“He looks like Rattleneck,” came Tul’s voice, his shadow falling across\nthem.\n“Bloody hell!” said Shivers. “I thought you didn’t like tall folk? It’s two\nof you standing on top of each other, ain’t it?”\n“Just the one.” Tul reached down and pulled him up by one arm like he\nwas a child fell over. “Sorry ’bout that greeting, friend. Those visitors we\nget we usually end up killing.”\n“I’ll hope to be the exception,” said Shivers, still gawping up at the\nThunderhead. “So that must be Harding Grim.”\n“Uh,” said Grim, scarcely looking up from checking his shafts.\n“And you’re Threetrees?”\n“That I am,” said the old boy, hands on his hips."

Deep water. Tul Duru, and Black\nDow, and… bloody hell. You’re Threetrees, eh?”\n“I’m him.”\n“Well, then. Shit. My father always said you was the best man left in all\nthe North.

He thought the way you did, and\nI’m cut from his cloth. Serving Bethod sticks in my neck.”\n“Might be I think a man should pick his chief and stick to him.”\n“I always thought so,” said Shivers, “but that blade cuts both ways, no?\nA chief should look out for his people too, shouldn’t he?” Dogman nodded\nto himself. A fair point, to his mind. “Bethod don’t care a shit for none of us\nno more, if he ever did. He don’t listen to no one now but that witch of his.”\n“Witch?” said Tul.\n“Aye, this sorceress, this Caurib, or whatever. The witch. The one who\nmakes the mist. Bethod’s dabbling with some dark company. And this war,\nthere’s no purpose to it. Angland? Who wants it anyway, we got land\naplenty. He’ll lead us all back to the mud. Long as there was no one else to\nfollow, we stuck with it, but when we heard Rudd Threetrees might still be\nalive, and with the Union, well…”\n“You decided to have a look, eh?”\n“We’ve had enough. Bethod’s got some strange boys along. These\neasterners, from out past the Crinna, bones-and-hides men, you know,\nhardly men at all. Got no code, no mercy, don’t hardly speak the same\nlanguage we do. Fucking savages, the lot of ’em. Bethod’s got some down\nin the Union fortress there, and they got all the bodies hung up on the walls,\nall cut with the bloody cross, guts hanging out, rotting. It ain’t right. Then\nthere’s Calder and Scale tossing out orders like they know shit from\nporridge, like they got some names o’ their own besides their father’s.”\n“Fucking Calder,” growled Tul, shaking his head.\n“Fucking Scale,” hissed Dow, spitting on the wet ground.\n“No bigger pair o’ bastards in all the North,” said Shivers. “And now I\nhear tell that Bethod’s made a deal.”\n“What kind of a deal?” asked Threetrees."

His face, for some reason, was\npale as death.\n“Clearly,” snapped Glokta. “That was them knocking at the door, I\nassume.” He dropped his spoon into his barely touched bowl of soup and\nlicked sourly at his gums. A particularly disgusting excuse for a meal, this\nevening. I miss Shickel’s cooking, if not her attempts to kill me. “Well, who\nis it, man?”\n“It’s… er… it’s…”\nArch Lector Sult ducked through the low doorway so as not to disturb\nhis flawless white hair on the frame. Ah. I see. He swept the cramped dining\nroom with a scowl, lip wrinkled as though he had stumbled into an open\nsewer. “Don’t get up,” he spat at Glokta. I wasn’t planning to.\nBarnam swallowed. “Can I get Your Eminence any—”\n“Get out!” sneered Sult, and the old servant nearly fell over in his haste\nto make it to the door. The Arch Lector watched him go with withering\nscorn. The good humour of our previous meeting seems a vaguely\nremembered dream.\n“Damn peasants,” he hissed as he slid in behind Glokta’s narrow dining\ntable. “There’s been another uprising near Keln, and this bastard the Tanner\nwas in the midst of it again. An unpopular eviction turned into a bloody riot.\nLord Finster entirely misjudged the mood, got three of his guards killed and\nhimself besieged in his manor by an angry mob, the half-wit. They couldn’t\nget in, fortunately, so they satisfied themselves with burning down half the\nvillage.” He snorted. “Their own damn village! That’s what an idiot does\nwhen he gets angry. He destroys whatever’s nearest, even if it’s his own\nhouse! The Open Council are screaming for blood, of course. Peasant\nblood, and lots of it. Now we have to get the Inquisition going down there,\nroot out some ringleaders, or some fools who can be made to look like\nthem.

Dagoska has fallen.”\nGlokta raised an eyebrow. Not so great a surprise, though. Hardly\nenough of a shock, one would have thought, to squeeze such a figure as His\nEminence into my narrow quarters.\n“It seems the Gurkish were let in by a prior arrangement. Treason, of\ncourse, but at a time like that… hardly surprising. The Union forces were\nmassacred, such as they were, but many of the mercenaries were merely\nenslaved, and the natives, by and large, were spared.” Gurkish mercy, who\ncould have thought it? Miracles do happen, then.\nSult flicked angrily at a speck of dust on one immaculate glove. “I hear\nthat, when the Gurkish had broken into the Citadel, General Vissbruck\nkilled himself rather than be captured.” Well, I never. I didn’t think he had it\nin him. “He ordered his body burned, so as not to give the enemy any\nremains to defile, then he cut his own throat. A brave man. A courageous\nstatement. He will be honoured in Open Council tomorrow.”\nHow wonderful for him. A horrible death with honour is far preferable\nto a long life in obscurity, of course. “Of course,” said Glokta quietly. “A\nbrave man.”\n“That is not all. An envoy has arrived on the very heels of this news. An\nenvoy from the Emperor of Gurkhul.”\n“An envoy?”\n“Indeed. Apparently seeking… peace.” The Arch Lector said the word\nwith a sneer of contempt.\n“Peace?”\n“This room seems rather small for an echo.”\n“Of course, Your Eminence, but—”\n“Why not? They have what they want. They have Dagoska, and there is\nnowhere further for them to go.”\n“No, Arch Lector.” Except, perhaps, across the sea…\n“Peace. It sticks in the craw to give anything away, but Dagoska was\nnever worth much to us. Cost us more than we made from it, if anything.\nNothing more than a trophy for the King. I daresay we’re better off without\nit, the worthless rock.”\nGlokta bowed his head. “Absolutely, Your Eminence.” Although it\nmakes one wonder why we bothered fighting for it.\n“Unfortunately, the loss of the place leaves you with nothing to be\nSuperior of.” The Arch Lector looked almost pleased. So it’s back to plain\nold Inquisitor, eh? I suppose I’ll no longer be welcome at the best social\ngatherings—“But I have decided to let you keep the title. As Superior of\nAdua.”\nGlokta paused. A considerable promotion, except that… “Surely, Your\nEminence, that is Superior Goyle’s role.”\n“It is. And will continue to be.”\n“Then—”\n“You will share the responsibilities. Goyle is the more experienced man,\nso he will be the senior partner, and continue running the department. For\nyou I will find some tasks suited to your particular talents. I’m hoping that a\nlittle healthy competition will bring out the best in you both.”"

I’m hoping that a\nlittle healthy competition will bring out the best in you both.”\nMore than likely it will end with one of us dead, and we can all guess\nwho the favourite is. Sult gave a thin smile, as though he knew precisely\nwhat Glokta was thinking. “Or perhaps it will simply demonstrate that one\nof you is superior to the other.” He barked a joyless laugh at his own joke,\nand Glokta gave a watery, toothless grin of his own.\n“In the meantime, I need you to deal with this envoy. You seem to have\na way of handling these Kantics, though you might avoid beheading this\none, at least for the time being.” The Arch Lector allowed himself another\nminuscule smile. “If he’s after anything more than peace, I want you to sniff\nit out. If we can get anything more than peace from him, then of course,\nsniff that out too. It would do no harm if we could avoid looking like we got\nour backs whipped.”\nHe stood awkwardly and manoeuvred himself out from behind the table,\nall the while frowning as though the tightness of the room was an\nintentional affront to his dignity. “And please, Glokta, find yourself some\nbetter quarters. A Superior of Adua, living like this? It’s an embarrassment!”\nGlokta humbly bowed his head, causing an unpleasant stinging right\ndown to his tailbone. “Of course, Your Eminence.”\nT\nhe Emperor’s envoy was a thickset man with a heavy black beard, a white\nskullcap, and a white robe worked with golden thread. He rose and bowed\nhumbly as Glokta hobbled over the threshold. As earthy and humble-\nseeming as the last emissary I dealt with was airy and arrogant. A different\nkind of man, I suppose, for a different purpose.\n“Ah. Superior Glokta, I should have guessed.” His voice was deep and\nrich, his mastery of the common tongue predictably excellent. “Many\npeople on our side of the sea were very disappointed when your corpse was\nnot among those found in the Citadel of Dagoska.”\n“I hope you will convey my sincere apologies to them.”\n“I will do so. My name is Tulkis, and I am a councillor to Uthman-ul-\nDosht, the Emperor of Gurkhul.” The envoy grinned, a crescent of strong\nwhite teeth in his black beard. “I hope I fare better at your hands than the\nlast emissary my people sent to you.”\nGlokta paused. A sense of humour? Most unexpected. “I suppose that\nwould depend on the tone you take.”\n“Of course. Shabbed al Islik Burai always was… confrontational. That,\nand his loyalties were… mixed.” Tulkis’ grin grew wider. “He was a\npassionate believer. A very religious man. A man closer, perhaps, to church\nthan to state? I honour God, of course.” And he touched his fingertips to his\nforehead. “I honour the great and holy Prophet Khalul.” He touched his\nhead again. “But I serve…” And his eyes slid up to Glokta’s. “I serve only\nthe Emperor.”"

And what might the Emperor wish to communicate to us?”\n“The difficulty of capturing Dagoska has shocked the people. The priests\nhad convinced them that the campaign would be easy, for God was with us,\nour cause was righteous, and so forth. God is great, of course,” and he\nlooked up to the ceiling, “but he is no substitute for good planning. The\nEmperor desires peace.”\nGlokta sat silent for a moment. “The great Uthman-ul-Dosht? The\nmighty? The merciless? Desires peace?”\nThe envoy took no offence. “I am sure you understand that a reputation\nfor ruthlessness can be useful. A great ruler, especially one of as wide and\nvarious a country as Gurkhul, must first be feared. He would desire to be\nloved also, but that is a luxury. Fear is essential. Whatever you may have\nheard, Uthman is neither a man of peace nor of war. He is a man of… what\nwould be your word? Necessity. He is a man of the right tool at the right\ntime.”\n“Very prudent,” muttered Glokta.\n“Peace, now. Mercy. Compromise. These are the tools that suit his\npurposes, even if they do not suit the purposes of… others.” And he touched\nhis fingers to his forehead. “And so he sends me, to find out if they suit you\nalso.”\n“Well, well, well. The mighty Uthman-ul-Dosht comes with mercy, and\noffers peace. These are strange times we live in, eh, Tulkis? Have the\nGurkish learned to love their enemies? Or simply fear them?”\n“One need not love one’s enemy, or even fear him, to desire peace. One\nneed only love oneself.”\n“Is that so?”\n“It is. I lost two sons in the wars between our peoples. One at Ulrioch in\nthe last war. He was a priest, and burned in the temple there. The other died\nnot long ago, at the siege of Dagoska. He led the charge when the first\nbreach was made.”\nGlokta frowned and stretched out his neck. A hail of flatbow bolts. Tiny\nfigures, falling in the rubble. “That was a brave charge.”\n“War is harshest on the brave.”\n“True. I am sorry for your losses.” Though I feel no sorrow, in\nparticular.\n“I thank you for your heartfelt condolences. God has seen fit to bless me\nwith three more sons, but the spaces left by those two children lost will\nnever close. It is almost like losing your own flesh. That is why I feel I\nunderstand something of what you have lost, in these same wars. I am sorry\nfor those losses also.”\n“Most kind.”\n“We are leaders. War is what happens when we fail.

Your entanglements in the North put you at a\nconsiderable disadvantage. Dagoska is lost, I would put it from your mind.”\nTulkis seemed to think about it for a moment. “However, I could arrange\nfor a dozen chests to be delivered, as reparations from my Emperor to your\nKing. Chests of fragrant ebony wood, worked with golden leaf, carried by\nbowing slaves, preceded by humble officials of the Emperor’s government.”\n“And what would these chests contain?”\n“Nothing.” They stared at each other across the room. “Except pride.\nYou could say they contained whatever you wished. A fortune in Gurkish\ngold, in Kantic jewels, in incense from beyond the desert. More than the\nvalue of Dagoska itself. Perhaps that would mollify your people.”\nGlokta breathed in sharply, and let it out. “Peace. And empty boxes.”\nHis left leg had gone numb under the table and he grimaced as he moved it,\nhissed through his gums as he forced himself out of his chair. “I will convey\nyour offer to my superiors.”\nHe was just turning away when Tulkis held out his hand.

The track dropped steeply away into a stretch of low, flat country, and\nbeyond was the shining line on the horizon. He could almost smell it, a\nsalty tang on the air with each breath. He would have grinned if it hadn’t\nreminded him of home so much.\n“The sea,” he whispered.\n“The ocean,” said Bayaz.\n“We have crossed the western continent from shore to shore,” said\nLongfoot, grinning all the way across his face. “We are close now.”\nBy afternoon they were closer still. The trail had widened to a muddy\nlane between fields, split up with ragged hedges. Mostly brown squares of\nturned earth, but some green with fresh grass, or with the sprouts of\nvegetables, some waving tall with a grey, tasteless-looking winter crop.\nLogen had never known much about farming, but it was plain enough that\nsomeone had been working this ground, and recently.\n“What kind of people live all the way out here?” murmured Luthar,"

Logen put his head up, listening. A thumping sound,\nechoing from some distance, then a voice, thin on the wind. He put his hand\non the grip of his sword and crouched down. He crept to an unruly stretch\nof hedge and peered over, Ferro beside him.\nTwo men were struggling with a tree stump in the midst of a turned\nfield, one chopping at it with an axe, the other watching, hands on hips.\nLogen swallowed, uneasy. These two hardly looked much of a threat, but\nlooks could lie. It had been a long time since they met a living thing that\nhadn’t tried to kill them.\n“Calm now,” muttered Bayaz. “There is no danger here.”\nFerro frowned across at him. “You’ve told us that before.”\n“Kill no one until I tell you!” hissed the Magus, then called out in a\nlanguage Logen didn’t know, waving one arm over his head in a gesture of\ngreeting. The two men jerked round, staring open-mouthed. Bayaz shouted\nagain. The farmers looked at each other, then set down their tools and\nwalked slowly over.\nThey stopped a few strides away. An ugly-looking pair, even to Logen’s\neye—short, stocky, rough-featured, dressed in colourless work clothes,\npatched and stained. They stared nervously at the six strangers, and at their\nweapons in particular, as though they’d never seen such people or such\nthings before.\nBayaz spoke to them warmly, smiling and waving his arms, pointing out\ntowards the ocean. One nodded, answered, shrugged and pointed down the\ntrack. He stepped through a gap in the hedge, off the field and into the road.\nOr from soft mud to hard mud, at least. He beckoned at them to follow\nwhile his companion watched suspiciously from the other side of the\nbushes.\n“He will take us to Cawneil,” said Bayaz.\n“To who?” muttered Logen, but the Magus did not answer. He was\nalready striding westwards after the farmer.\nH\neavy dusk under a grim sky, and they trudged through an empty town\nafter their sullen guide. A singularly ill-favoured fellow, Jezal rather\nthought, but then peasants were rarely beauties in his experience, and he\nsupposed that they were much the same the world over. The streets were\ndusty and deserted, weedy and scattered with refuse. Many houses were\nderelict, furry with moss and tangled with creeper. Those few that did show\nsigns of occupation were, in the main, in a slovenly condition.\n“It would seem the glory of the past is faded here also,” said Longfoot\nwith some disappointment, “if indeed there ever was any.”\nBayaz nodded. “Glory is in short supply these days.”"

Ornamental\ngardens had been planted round the edge by some forgotten gardener, but\nthe lawns were threadbare, the flowerbeds turned to briar patches, the trees\nno more than withered claws. Out of this slow decay rose a huge and\nstriking building, or more accurately a jumble of buildings of various\nconfused shapes and styles. Three tall, round, tapering towers sprouted from\ntheir midst, joined at their bases but separating higher up. One was broken\noff before the summit, its roof long fallen in, leaving naked rafters exposed.\n“A library…” whispered Logen under his breath.\nIt scarcely looked like one to Jezal. “It is?”\n“The Great Western Library,” said Bayaz as they crossed the dilapidated\nsquare in the looming shadow of those three crumbling towers. “Here I took\nmy first hesitant steps along the path of Art. Here my master taught me the\nFirst Law. Taught it to me again and again until I could recite it flawlessly\nin every language known. This was a place of learning, and wonder, and\ngreat beauty.”\nLongfoot sucked his teeth. “Time has not been kind to the place.”\n“Time is never kind.”\nTheir guide said a few short words and indicated a tall door covered in\nflaking green paint. Then he shuffled away, eyeing them all with the deepest\nsuspicion.\n“You simply cannot get the help,” observed the First of the Magi as he\nwatched the farmer hurry off, then he raised his staff and struck the door\nthree good knocks. There was a long silence.\n“Library?” Jezal heard Ferro asking, evidently unfamiliar with the word.\n“For books,” came Logen’s voice.\n“Books,” she snorted. “Waste of fucking time.”\nVague sounds echoed from beyond the gate: someone approaching\ninside, accompanied by an irritated muttering. Now locks clicked and\ngrated and the weathered door squealed open. A man of an advanced age\nand a pronounced stoop gazed at them in wonder, an unintelligible curse\nfrozen on his lips, a lighted taper casting a faint glow over one side of his\nwrinkled face.\n“I am Bayaz, the First of the Magi, and I have business with Cawneil.”\nThe servant continued to gawp. Jezal half expected a string of drool to\nescape from his toothless mouth, it was hanging open so wide. Plainly, they\ndid not receive large numbers of visitors.\nThe one flickering taper was pitifully inadequate to light the lofty hall\nbeyond. Weighty tables sagged under tottering piles of books. Shelves rose\nup high on every wall, lost in the fusty darkness overhead. Shadows shifted\nover leather-bound spines of every size and colour, on bundles of loose\nparchments, on scrolls rolled and carelessly stacked in leaning pyramids.\nLight sparked and flashed on silver gilt, and gold ornamentation, and dull\njewels set into tomes of daunting size. A long staircase, banister highly\npolished by the passage of countless hands, steps worn down in the centres"

A long staircase, banister highly\npolished by the passage of countless hands, steps worn down in the centres\nby the passage of countless feet, curved gracefully down into the midst of\nthis accumulation of ancient knowledge. Dust sat thickly on every surface.\nOne particularly monstrous cobweb became stickily tangled in Jezal’s hair\nas he passed over the threshold, and he flicked and wrestled at it, face\nwrinkled in distaste.\n“The lady of the house,” wheezed the doorman in a strange accent, “has\nalready taken to her couch.”\n“Then wake her,” snapped Bayaz. “The hour grows dark and I am in\nhaste. We have no time to—”\n“Well. Well. Well.” A woman stood upon the steps. “The hour grows\ndark indeed, when old lovers come calling at my door.” A deep voice,\nsmooth as syrup. She sauntered down the stairs with exaggerated slowness,\none set of long nails trailing on the curving banister. She seemed perhaps of\nmiddle age: tall, thin, graceful, a curtain of long black hair falling over half\nher face.\n“Sister. We have urgent matters to discuss.”\n“Ah, do we indeed?” The one eye that Jezal could see was large, dark,\nand heavy-lidded, rimmed faintly with sore, tearful pink. Languorously,\nlazily, almost sleepily it flowed over the group. “How atrociously tiresome.”\n“I am weary, Cawneil, I need none of your games.”\n“We all are weary, Bayaz. We all are terribly weary.” She gave a long,\ntheatrical sigh as she finally glided to the foot of the steps and across the\nuneven floor towards them. “There was a time when you were willing to\nplay. You would play my games for days at a time, as I recall.”\n“That was long ago. Things change.”\nHer face twisted with a sudden and unsettling anger. “Things rot, you\nmean! But still”—and her voice softened again to a deep whisper—“we last\nremnants of the great order of Magi should at least try to remain civil.\nCome now, my brother, my friend, my sweet, there is no need for undue\nhaste. The day grows late, and there is time for you all to wash away the dirt\nof the road, discard those stinking rags, and dress for dinner. Then we can\ntalk over food, as civilised persons are wont to do. I so rarely have guests to\nentertain.” She swept past Logen, looking him admiringly up and down.\n“And you have brought me such rugged guests.” She lingered on Ferro with\nher eyes. “Such exotic guests.” Now she reached up and let a long finger\ntrail across Jezal’s cheek. “Such comely guests!”\nJezal stood, rigid with embarrassment, entirely at a loss as to how to\nrespond to this liberty. At close quarters her black hair was grey at the roots,\nno doubt heavily dyed. Her smooth skin seemed wrinkled and a touch\nyellow, no doubt heavily powdered. Her white gown was dirty round the\nhem, had a noticeable stain on one sleeve. She seemed as old as Bayaz\nlooked, or perhaps older yet.\nShe peered into the corner where Quai was standing, and frowned."

She seemed as old as Bayaz\nlooked, or perhaps older yet.\nShe peered into the corner where Quai was standing, and frowned.\n“What manner of guest this is, I am not sure… but you are welcome all at\nthe Great Western Library. Welcome all…”\nJ\nezal blinked at the looking glass, his razor hanging from one nerveless\nhand.\nOnly a few moments before he had been reflecting on the journey, now\nthat it was finally approaching its end, and congratulating himself on how\nmuch he had learned. Tolerance and understanding, courage and self-\nsacrifice. How he had grown as a man. How much he had changed.\nCongratulations no longer seemed appropriate. The looking glass might\nhave been an antique, his reflection in it dark and distorted, but there could\nbe no doubt that his face was a ruin.\nThe pleasing symmetry was gone forever. His perfect jaw was skewed\nround sharply to the left, heavier on one side than the other, his noble chin\nwas twisted at a slovenly angle. The scar began on his top lip as no more\nthan a faint line, but it split in two and gouged brutally into the bottom one,\ndragging it down and giving him the appearance of having a permanent and\nunsightly leer.\nNo effort on his part helped. Smiling made it far worse yet, exposing the\nugly gaps in his teeth, more suited to a prizefighter or a bandit than to an\nofficer of the King’s Own. The one mercy was that he would very likely die\non the return journey, and no one of his old acquaintance would ever see\nhim so horribly disfigured. A meagre consolation indeed.\nA single tear plopped down into the basin under his face.\nThen he swallowed, and he took a shuddering breath, and he wiped his\nwet cheek with the back of his forearm. He set his jaw, in its strange new\nconfiguration, and he gripped the razor tightly. The damage was done now,\nand there could be no going back. Perhaps he was an uglier man, but he was\na better man too, and at least, as Logen would have said, he was still alive.\nHe gave the razor a flourish and scraped the patchy, straggling hair from his\ncheeks, from before his ears, from his throat. On his lip, his chin, and\naround his mouth he left it be. The beard looked well on him, he rather\nthought, as he rubbed the razor dry. Or it went a meagre way towards hiding\nhis disfigurement at least.\nHe pulled on the clothes that had been left for him. A fusty-smelling\nshirt and breeches of an ancient and absurdly unfashionable design. He\nalmost laughed at his ill-formed reflection when he was finally prepared for\ndinner. The carefree denizens of the Agriont would hardly have recognised\nhim. He hardly recognised himself.\nThe evening repast was not all that Jezal might have hoped for at the\ntable of an important historical figure. The silverware was tarnished in the\nextreme, the plate worn and cracked, the table itself slanted to the point that\nJezal was constantly expecting the entire meal to slide off onto the dirty\nfloor.

Food was served by the shambling doorman, at no faster pace than he\nhad answered the gate, each dish arriving colder and more congealed than\nthe last. First came a sticky soup of surpassing tastelessness. Next was a\npiece of fish so overcooked it was little more than ashes, then most recently\na slab of meat so undercooked as to be virtually still alive.\nBayaz and Cawneil ate in stony silence, staring at each other down the\nlength of the table in a way which seemed calculated to make everyone\nuncomfortable. Quai did nothing more than pick at his food, his dark eyes\nflicking intently between the two elderly Magi. Longfoot stuck into every\ncourse with relish, smiling round at the company as though they were all\nenjoying themselves equally. Logen was holding his fork in his fist,\nfrowning and stabbing clumsily at his plate as if it were a troublesome\nShanka, the ballooning sleeves of his ill-fitting doublet trailing occasionally\nin his food. Jezal had little doubt that Ferro could have used the cutlery with\ngreat dexterity had she wished, but she chose instead to eat with her hands,\nstaring aggressively at anyone who met her gaze as if daring them to tell her\nnot to. She had on the same travel-stained clothes she had worn for the past\nweek, and Jezal wondered for a moment if she had been provided with a\ndress to wear. He nearly choked on his dinner at the notion.\nNeither the meal, nor the company, nor the surroundings were quite\nwhat Jezal would have chosen, but the fact was that they had largely run out\nof food a few days before. Rations in that space of time had included a\nhandful of chalky roots dug from the mountainside by Logen, six tiny eggs\nstolen by Ferro from a high nest, and some berries of indescribable\nbitterness, which Longfoot had plucked from a tree, apparently at random.\nJezal would happily have eaten his plate. He frowned as he hacked at the\ngristly meat on it, wondering if the plate might indeed be a tastier option.\n“Is the ship still seaworthy?” growled Bayaz. Everyone looked up. The\nfirst words to have been said in quite some time.\nCawneil’s dark eye regarded him coldly. “Do you mean that ship on\nwhich Juvens and his brothers sailed to Shabulyan?”\n“What other?”\n“Then no. It is not seaworthy. It is rotted to green mulch in its old dock.\nBut do not fear. Another was built, and when that rotted also, another after\nit. The latest rocks on the tides, tethered to the shore, well coated with weed\nand barnacle, but kept always crewed and victualled. I have not forgotten\nmy promise to our master. I marked well my obligations.”\nBayaz’s brows drew angrily down. “Meaning, I suppose, that I did not?”\n“I did not say so. If you hear a reproach, it is your own guilt that goads\nyou, not my accusation. I take no sides, you know that. I never have.”\n“You speak as though sloth were the greatest of virtues,” muttered the\nFirst of the Magi."

I never have.”\n“You speak as though sloth were the greatest of virtues,” muttered the\nFirst of the Magi.\n“Sometimes it is, if acting means taking part in your squabbles. You\nforget, Bayaz, that I have seen all this before, more than once, and a\nwearisome pattern it seems to me. History repeats itself. Brother fights\nbrother. As Juvens fought Glustrod, as Kanedias fought Juvens, so Bayaz\nstruggles with Khalul. Smaller men in a bigger world, but with no less\nhatred, and no more mercy. Will this sordid rivalry end even as well as the\nothers? Or will it be worse?”\nBayaz snorted. “Let us not pretend you care, or would drag yourself ten\nstrides from your couch if you did.”\n“I do not care. I freely admit it. I was never like you or Khalul, or even\nlike Zacharus or Yulwei. I have no endless ambition, no bottomless\narrogance.”\n“No, indeed, not you.” Bayaz sucked disgustedly at his gums and tossed\nhis fork clattering down onto his plate. “Only endless vanity and bottomless\nidleness.”\n“Mine are small vices and small virtues. To see the world recast\naccording to my own great designs has never interested me. I have always\nbeen content with the world as it is, and so I am a dwarf among giants.” Her\nheavy-lidded eyes swept slowly over her guests, one by one. “And yet\ndwarves crush no one underfoot.” Jezal coughed as her searching stare fell\non him and gave careful attention to his rubbery meat. “Long is the list of\nthose you have trodden over in pursuit of your ambitions, is it not, my\nlove?”\nBayaz’s displeasure began to weigh on Jezal as heavily as a great stone.\n“You need not speak in riddles, sister,” growled the old man. “I would have\nyour meaning.”\n“Ah, I forgot. You are a straight talker, and cannot abide deception of\nany kind. You told me so just after you told me you would never leave me,\nand just before you left me to find another.”\n“That was not my choice. You wrong me, Cawneil.”\n“I wrong you?” she hissed, and now her anger pressed hard at Jezal from\nthe other side. “How, brother? Did you not leave? Did you not find another?\nDid you not steal from the Maker, first his secrets, then his daughter?” Jezal\nsquirmed and hunched his shoulders, feeling as squeezed as a nut in a vise.\n“Tolomei, do you remember her?”\nBayaz’s frown grew frostier yet. “I have made my mistakes, and still pay\nfor them. Not a day passes that I do not think of her.”\n“How outrageously noble of you!” sneered Cawneil. “No doubt she\nwould swoon with gratitude, if she could hear you now! I think on that day\ntoo, now and then. The day the Old Time ended. How we gathered outside\nthe House of the Maker, thirsty for vengeance. How we put forth all of our\nArt and all of our anger, and could not make a scratch upon the gates. How"

How\nyou whispered to Tolomei in the night, begging her to let you in.” She\npressed her withered hands to her chest. “Such tender words you used.\nWords I never dreamed were in you. Even an old cynic like me was moved.\nHow could an innocent like Tolomei deny you, whether it was her father’s\ngates or her own legs she was opening? And what was her reward, eh,\nbrother, for her sacrifices? For helping you, for trusting you, for loving you?\nIt must have been quite the dramatic scene! The three of you, up on the\nroof. A foolish young woman, her jealous father, and her secret lover.” She\nsnorted bitter laughter. “Never a happy formula, but it can rarely have\nended quite so badly. Father and daughter both. The long drop to the\nbridge!”\n“Kanedias had no mercy in him,” growled Bayaz, “even for his own\nchild. Before my eyes he threw his daughter from the roof. We fought, and I\ncast him down in flames. So was our master avenged.”\n“Oh, well done!” Cawneil clapped her hands in mock delight.\n“Everyone loves a happy ending! Tell me only one thing more. What was it\nthat made you weep so long for Tolomei, when I could never make you\nshed a tear? Did you decide you like your women pure, eh, brother?” And\nshe fluttered her eyelashes in an ironical show, one strangely unsettling on\nthat ancient face. “Innocence? That most fleeting and worthless of virtues.\nOne to which I have never laid claim.”\n“Perhaps then, sister, the one thing you have never laid?”\n“Oh, very good, my old love, very fine. It was always your ready wit\nthat I enjoyed, above all else. Khalul was the more skilful lover, of course,\nbut he never had your passion, nor your daring.” She speared a chunk of\nmeat viciously with her fork. “Travelling to the edge of the World, at your\nage? To steal that thing our master forbade? Courage indeed.”\nBayaz sneered his contempt down the table. “What would you know of\ncourage? You, who have loved no one in all these long years but yourself?\nWho have risked nothing, and given nothing, and made nothing? You, who\nhave let all the gifts our master gave you rot! Keep your stories in the dust,\nsister. No one cares, and me least of all.”\nThe two Magi glared at each other in icy silence, the atmosphere heavy\nwith their seething fury. The feet of Ninefingers’ chair squealed gently as he\nedged it cautiously away from the table. Ferro sat opposite, her face locked\nin a frown of the deepest suspicion. Malacus Quai had his teeth bared, his\nfierce eyes fixed on his master. Jezal could only sit and hold his breath,\nhoping that the incomprehensible argument did not end with anyone on fire.\nEspecially not him.\n“Well,” ventured Brother Longfoot, “I for one would like to thank our\nhost for this excellent meal…” The two old Magi locked him"

She remembered frowning at the walls of her cell\nin Uthman’s palace, pulling herself up to look through the tiny window,\nfeeling the sun on her face and dreaming of being free. She remembered the\nchafing iron on her ankle, and the long thin chain, so much stronger than it\nhad looked. She remembered struggling with it, and chewing on it, and\ndragging at her foot until the blood ran from her torn skin. She hated walls.\nFor her, they had always been the jaws of a trap.\nFerro frowned at the bed. She hated beds, and couches, and cushions.\nSoft things make you soft, and she did not need them. She remembered\nlying in the darkness on a soft bed when she was first made a slave. When\nshe was still a child, and small, and weak. Lying in the darkness and\nweeping to be alone. Ferro dug savagely at the scab and felt blood seep\nfrom underneath. She hated that weak, foolish child who had allowed\nherself to be trapped. She despised the memory of her.\nFerro frowned most of all at Ninefingers, lying on his back with the\nblankets rucked and rumpled round him, his head tipped back and his\nmouth hanging open, eyes closed, breath hissing soft in his nose, one pale\narm flung out wide at an uncomfortable-looking angle. Sleeping like a\nchild. Why had she fucked him? And why did she keep doing it? She should\nnever have touched him. She should never have spoken to him. She did not\nneed him, the ugly, big pink fool.\nShe needed no one.\nFerro told herself she hated all these things, and that her hatred could\nnever fade. But however she curled her lip, and frowned, and picked her\nscabs, it was hard to feel the same. She looked at the bed, at the dark wood\nshining in the glow from the embers in the fireplace, at the shifting blobs of\nshadow in the wrinkled sheet. What difference would it really make to\nanyone, if she lay there rather than on the cold, wide mattress in her own\nroom? The bed was not her enemy. So she got up from the chair, and\npadded over and slid down into it with her back to Ninefingers, taking care\nnot to wake him. Not for his sake, of course.\nBut she had no wish to explain herself.\nShe wriggled her shoulders, moving backwards towards him, where it\nwas warmer. She heard him grunt in his sleep, felt him roll. She tensed to\nspring out of the bed, holding her breath. His arm slid over her side and he\nmuttered something in her ear, meaningless sleep sounds, breath hot on her\nneck.\nHis big warm body pressed up tight against her back no longer made her"

The weight of his pale hand resting gently against her ribs,\nhis heavy arm around her felt almost… good. That made her frown.\nNothing good ever lasts for long.\nAnd so she slid her hand over the back of his and felt his fingers, and the\nstump of the one that was missing, pressing into the spaces between hers,\nand she pretended that she was safe, and whole. Where was the harm? She\nheld on to the hand tightly, and pressed it to her chest.\nBecause she knew it would not be for long.\nBefore the Storm\nW\nelcome, gentlemen. General Poulder, General Kroy. Bethod has\nretreated as far as the Whiteflow, and it does not seem likely that he will\nfind any more favourable ground on which to face us.” Burr took a sharp\nbreath, sweeping the gathering with a grave expression. “I think it very\nlikely that there will be a battle tomorrow.”\n“Good show!” shouted Poulder, slapping his thigh with great aplomb.\n“My men are ready,” murmured Kroy, lifting his chin one regulation\ninch. The two Generals, and the many members of their respective staffs,\nglowered at each other across the wide space of Burr’s tent, every man\ntrying to outdo his opposite number with his boundless enthusiasm for\ncombat. West felt his lip curling as he watched them. Two gangs of children\nin a schoolyard could scarcely have behaved with less maturity.\nBurr raised his eyebrows and turned to his maps. “Luckily for us, the\narchitects who built the fortress at Dunbrec also surveyed the surrounding\nland in some detail. We are blessed with highly accurate charts.\nFurthermore, a group of Northmen have recently defected to our cause,\nbringing with them detailed information on Bethod’s forces, position, and\nintentions.”\n“Why should we believe the word of a pack of Northern dogs,” sneered\nGeneral Kroy, “who have no loyalty even to their own King?”\n“Had Prince Ladisla been more willing to listen to them, sir,” intoned\nWest, “he might still be with us. As might his division.” General Poulder\nchuckled heartily to himself, and his staff joined him. Kroy, predictably,\nwas less amused. He shot a deadly glare across the tent, one which West\nreturned with an icy blankness.\nBurr cleared his throat, and soldiered on. “Bethod holds the fortress of\nDunbrec.” The point of his stick tapped at the black hexagon. “Positioned to\ncover the only significant road out of Angland, where it fords the River\nWhiteflow, our border with the North. The road approaches the fortress\nfrom the west, cutting eastwards down a wide valley between two wooded\nridges. The body of Bethod’s forces are encamped near the fortress, but he\nmeans to mount an attack westwards up the road as soon as we show our\nfaces.” And Burr’s stick slashed along the dark line, swishing against the\nheavy paper. “The valley through which the road passes is bare, open grass\nwith some gorse and rocky outcroppings, and will give him ample room for"

Or at least… to seem to. General Kroy?”\nKroy finally broke off glowering at West to reply with a sullen, “Yes,\nLord Marshal?”\n“Your division is to deploy astride the road and push steadily eastwards\ntowards the fortress, encouraging Bethod to launch his attack. Slowly and\nsteadily, with no heroics. General Poulder’s division, meanwhile, will have\nworked its way through the trees on top of the northern ridge, here”—and\nhis stick tapped at the green blocks of the wooded high ground—“just\nforward of General Kroy’s position.”\n“Just forward of General Kroy’s position,” grinned Poulder, as though\nhe was being shown special favour. Kroy scowled with disgust.\n“Just forward, yes,” continued Burr. “When Bethod’s forces are entirely\noccupied in the valley, it shall be your task to attack them from above, and\ntake them in the flank. It is important that you wait until the Northmen have\nbeen fully engaged, General Poulder, so that we can surround them,\noverwhelm them, and hope to bag the majority at one throw. If they are\nallowed to retire to the fords, the fortress will cover their retreat, and we\nwill be unable to pursue. Reducing Dunbrec might take us months.”\n“Of course, my Lord Marshal,” exclaimed Poulder, “my division will\nwait until the last moment. You may depend upon it!”\nKroy snorted. “That should present no difficulty. Arriving late is a\nspeciality of yours, I understand. There would be no need for a battle if you\nhad intercepted the Northmen last week, rather than allowing them to get\naround you!”\nPoulder bristled. “Easy for you to say, while you were sitting on the\nright wing doing nothing! It’s fortunate they didn’t pass by in the night! You\nmight have taken their retreat for an assault and fled with your entire\ndivision!”\n“Gentlemen, please!” roared Burr, smashing the table with his stick.\n“There will be fighting enough for every man in the army, that I promise\nyou, and if each man does his part, there will be ample glory too! We must\nwork together if this plan is to bear fruit!” He burped and grimaced and\nlicked his lips sourly, while the two Generals and their staffs glowered at\none another. West would almost have laughed, had men’s lives not hung in\nthe balance, his own among them.\n“General Kroy,” said Burr, in the tone of a parent addressing a wayward\nchild. “I wish to make sure that you understand your orders.”\n“To deploy my division in line astride the road,” hissed Kroy, “and to\nadvance slowly and in good order, eastwards down the valley towards\nDunbrec, drawing Bethod and his savages into an engagement.”\n“Indeed.

General Poulder?”\n“To move my division out of sight through the trees, just ahead of\nGeneral Kroy’s regiments, so that at the last moment I can charge down on\nthe Northern scum and take them in the flank.”\nBurr managed a smile. “Correct.”\n“An excellent plan, Lord Marshal, if I may!” Poulder tugged happily at\nhis moustaches. “You can depend upon it that my horse will cut them to\npieces. To! Pieces!”\n“I am afraid you will not have any cavalry, General,” said West in an\nemotionless monotone. “The woods are dense, and horses will be useless to\nyou there. They might even alert the Northmen to your presence. A risk we\ncannot take.”\n“But… my cavalry,” muttered Poulder, stricken with woe. “My best\nregiments!”\n“They will be kept here, sir,” droned West, “near Marshal Burr’s\nheadquarters, and under his direct control, as a reserve. They will be\ndeployed if they are needed.” Now it was Poulder’s fury he met with a\nstonewall stare, while the faces of Kroy and his staff broke out in broad,\nneat, utterly joyless smiles.\n“I hardly think—” hissed Poulder.\nBurr cut him off. “That is my decision. There is one last point that you\nshould all bear in mind. There are some reports that Bethod has called on\nreinforcements. Some manner of wild men, savages from across the\nmountains to the north. Keep your eyes open and your flanks well screened.\nYou will receive word from me tomorrow when it is time to move, most\nlikely before first light. That is all.”\n“Can we really rely on them to do what they are told?” muttered West as\nhe watched the two surly groups file from the tent.\n“What choice do we have?” The Marshal threw himself into a chair with\na grimace and rested his hands on his belly, frowning up at the great map. “I\nwouldn’t worry. Kroy has no option but to move down the valley and fight.”\n“What about Poulder? I wouldn’t put it past him to find some excuse to\nstay sitting in the woods.”\nThe Lord Marshal grinned as he shook his head. “And leave Kroy to do\nall the fighting? What if he were to beat the Northmen on his own, and take\nall the glory for himself? No. Poulder could never risk that. This plan gives\nthem no choice but to work together.” He paused, looking up at West. “You\nmight want to treat the pair of them with a touch more respect.”\n“Do you think they deserve it, sir?”\n“Of course not. But if, for instance, we should lose tomorrow, one of\nthem will most likely step into my boots. Then where will you be?”\nWest grinned. “I’ll be finished, sir. But my being polite now won’t\nchange that. They hate me for what I am, not what I say. I might as well say\nwhat I please while I can.”\n“I suppose you might at that. They’re a damn nuisance, but their folly\ncan be predicted. It’s Bethod that worries me. Will he do what we want him"

Will he do what we want him\nto?” Burr burped, and swallowed, and burped again. “Damn this damn\nindigestion!”\nThreetrees and the Dogman were sprawled on a bench outside the tent\nflap, an odd pair in amongst the well-starched press of officers and guards.\n“Smells like battle to me,” said Threetrees as West strode up to them.\n“Indeed.” West pointed after Kroy’s black-uniformed staff. “Half the\narmy are going down the valley tomorrow morning, hoping to draw Bethod\ninto a fight.” He pointed to Poulder’s crimson entourage. “The other half are\ngoing up into the trees, and hope to surprise them before they can get\naway.”\nThreetrees nodded slowly to himself. “Sounds like a good plan.”\n“Nice and simple,” said the Dogman. West winced. He could hardly bear\nto look at the man.\n“We’d have no plan at all if you hadn’t brought us that information,” he\nmanaged to say through gritted teeth. “Are you sure we can trust it?”\n“Sure as we can be,” said Threetrees.\nDogman grinned. “Shivers is alright, and from what I’ve scouted up, I\nreckon it’s true. No promises, course.”\n“Of course not. You deserve a rest.”\n“We wouldn’t say no.”\n“I’ve arranged a position for you up at the far left of the line, at the end\nof General Poulder’s division, up in the trees, on the high ground. You\nshould be well out of the action there. The safest place in the whole army\ntomorrow, I shouldn’t wonder. Dig in and make yourself a fire, and if things\ngo right, we’ll talk again over Bethod’s dead body.” And he held out his\nhand.\nThreetrees grinned as he took it. “Now, that’s our kind of language,\nFurious. You take care, now.” He and the Dogman started to trudge away up\nthe slope towards the tree line.\n“Colonel West?”\nHe knew who it was before he turned. There weren’t many women in\nthe camp that would have had much to say to him. Cathil, standing in the\nslush, a borrowed coat wrapped round her. She looked somewhat furtive,\nsomewhat shamefaced, but the sight of her still somehow brought up a\nsudden surge of anger and embarrassment.\nIt was unfair, he knew. He had no rights over her. It was unfair, but that\nonly made it worse. All he could think of was the side of the Dogman’s face\nand her grunting, uh… uh… uh. So horribly surprising. So horribly\ndisappointing. “You’d better go with them,” said West with an icy formality,\nscarcely able to bring himself to say anything at all. “Safest place.” He\nturned away, but she brought him up short.\n“It was you, wasn’t it, outside the tent… the other night?”\n“Yes, I’m afraid it was. I simply came to check if there was anything\nyou needed,” he lied. “I really had no idea… who you would be with.”"

I mean… why?” Why him instead of me, was\nwhat he wanted to say, but he managed to stop himself.\n“I know… I know you must think—”\n“You’ve no need to explain yourself to me!” he hissed, though he knew\nhe’d just asked her to. “Who cares what I think?” He spat it out with a deal\nmore venom than he had intended, but his own loss of control only made\nhim angrier, and he lost more. “I don’t care what you choose to fuck!”\nShe winced and stared down at the ground beside his feet. “I didn’t\nmean to… well. I owe you a lot, I know. It’s just that… you’re too angry for\nme. That’s all.”\nWest stared at her as she trudged off up the hill after the Northmen,\nhardly able to believe his ears. She was happy to bed that stinking savage,\nbut he was too angry? It was so unfair he almost choked on his rage.\nQuestions\nC\nolonel Glokta charged into his dining room in a tremendous hurry,\nwrestling manfully with the buckle on his sword belt.\n“Damn it!” he fumed. He was all thumbs. Couldn’t get the thing closed.\n“Damn it, damn it!”\n“You need some help with that?” asked Shickel, sitting wedged in\nbehind the table, black burns across her shoulders, cuts hanging open, dry\nas meat in the butcher’s shop.\n“No I do not need bloody help!” he shrieked, flinging his belt onto the\nfloor. “What I need is for someone to explain what the hell is going on here!\nThis is a disgrace! I will not have members of my regiment sitting around\nnaked! Especially with such unsightly wounds! Where is your uniform,\ngirl?”\n“I thought you were more worried about the Prophet.”\n“Never mind about him!” snapped Glokta, worming his way onto the\nbench opposite her. “What about Bayaz? What about the First of the Magi?\nWho is he? What’s he really after, the old bastard?”\nShickel smiled a sweet smile. “Oh, that. I thought everyone knew that.\nThe answer is…”\n“Yes!” muttered the Colonel, mouth dry, eager as a schoolboy, “The\nanswer is?”\nShe laughed, and slapped at the bench beside her. Thump, thump, thump.\n“The answer is…”\nT\nhe answer is…\nThump, thump, thump. Glokta’s eyes snapped open. It was still half-\ndark outside. Only a faint glow was coming through the curtains. Who\ncomes belting at the door at this hour? Good news comes in the daylight.\nThump, thump, thump. “Yes, yes!” he screeched. “I’m crippled, not\ndeaf! I damn well hear you!”\n“Then open the bloody door!” The voice came muffled from the\ncorridor, but there was no mistaking the Styrian note. Vitari, the bitch. Just"

Just\nwhat one needs in the middle of the night. Glokta did his best to stifle his\ngroans as he carefully disentangled his numb limbs from his sweaty\nblanket, rolling his head gently from side to side, trying to stretch some\nmovement into his twisted neck, and failing.\nThump, thump. I wonder, when was the last time I had a woman beating\ndown my bedroom door? He snatched his cane from its place resting against\nthe mattress, then pressed one of his few teeth hard into his lip, grunting\nsoftly to himself as he wormed his way down the bed and let one leg flop\noff onto the boards. He threw himself forward, eyes squeezed shut at a\nwithering pain through his back, and finally reached sitting, gasping as\nthough he had run ten miles. Fear me, fear me, all must fear me! If I can\njust get out of bed, that is.\nThump. “I’m coming, damn it!” He footed his cane on the floor and\nrocked himself up to standing. Careful, careful. The muscles in his\nmutilated left leg were shaking violently, making his toeless foot twitch and\nflop like a dying fish. Damn this hideous appendage! It would feel like\nsomeone else’s if it didn’t hurt so much. But calm, calm, we must be gentle.\n“Shhh,” he hissed, like a parent trying to soothe a wailing child,\nkneading softly at his ruined flesh and trying to breathe slow. “Shhh.” The\nconvulsions slowly calmed to a more manageable trembling. About the best\nthat we can hope for, I fear. He was able to pull his nightshirt down and\nshuffle to the door, flip the key angrily round in the lock, and pull it open.\nVitari stood outside in the corridor, draped against the wall, a darker shape\nin the shadows.\n“You,” he grunted, hopping to the chair. “You just can’t stay away, can\nyou? What is your fascination with my bedchamber?”\nShe sauntered through the door, peering around scornfully at the\nmiserable room. “Perhaps I just like seeing you in pain.”\nGlokta snorted, rubbing gingerly at his burning knee. “Then you must be\nwet between the legs right now.”\n“Surprisingly, no. You look like death.”\n“When don’t I? Did you come to mock my looks, or have we some\nbusiness?”\nVitari folded her long arms and leaned against the wall. “You need to get\ndressed.”\n“More excuses to see me naked?”\n“Sult wants you.”\n“Now?”\nShe rolled her eyes. “Oh no, we can take our time. You know how he\nis.”\nW\nhere are we going?”\n“You’ll see when we get there.” And she upped her pace, making him\ngasp and wince, snorting his aching way through the dim archways, down\nthe shadowy lanes and the grey courtyards of the Agriont, colourless in the\nthin light of early morning.\nHis clumsy boots crunched and scraped in the gravel of the park.

The\ngrass was heavy with cold dew, the air thick with dull mist. Trees loomed\nup, black and leafless claws in the murk, and then a towering, sheer wall.\nVitari led him towards a high gate flanked by two guards. Their heavy\narmour was worked with gold, their heavy halberds were studded with gold,\nthe golden sun of the Union was stitched into their surcoats. Knights of the\nBody. The King’s personal guard.\n“The palace?” muttered Glokta.\n“No, the slums, genius.”\n“Halt.” One of the two knights raised his gauntleted hand, voice echoing\nslightly from the grill in his tall helmet. “State your names and business.”\n“Superior Glokta.” He hobbled to the wall and leaned against the damp\nstones, pressing his tongue into his empty gums against the pain in his leg.\n“As for the business, ask her. This wasn’t my idea, I can damn well tell you\nthat.”\n“Practical Vitari. And the Arch Lector is expecting us. You know that\nalready, fool, I told you on the way out.”\nIf it were possible for a man in full armour to appear hurt, this one did.\n“It is a matter of protocol that I ask everyone—”\n“Just get it open!” barked Glokta, pressing his fist into his trembling\nthigh. “While I can still lurch through on my own!”\nThe man thumped angrily on the gate and a small door opened inside it.\nVitari ducked through and Glokta limped after her, along a path of carefully\ncut stones through a shadowy garden. Drops of cold water clung to the\nbudding branches, dripped from the towering statuary. The cawing of a\ncrow somewhere out of sight seemed ridiculously loud in the morning\nstillness. The palace loomed up ahead of them, a confusion of roofs, towers,\nsculptures, ornamental stonework outlined against the first pale glow of\nmorning.\n“What are we doing here?” hissed Glokta.\n“You’ll find out.”\nHe limped up a step, between towering columns and two more Knights\nof the Body, still and silent enough to have been empty suits of armour. His\ncane clicked on the polished marble floor of an echoing hallway, half-lit by\nflickering candles, the high walls covered entirely with dim friezes. Scenes\nof forgotten victories and achievements, one King after another pointing,\nbrandishing weapons, reading proclamations, standing with their chests\npuffed out in pride. He struggled up a flight of steps, ceiling and walls\ncarved entirely in a glorious pattern of golden flowers, flashing and\nglittering in the candlelight, while Vitari waited impatiently for him at the\ntop. Their being priceless doesn’t make them any easier to climb, damn it.\n“Down there,” she muttered at him.\nA worried-looking group were gathered round a door twenty strides\naway. A Knight of the Body sat bent over on a chair, his helmet on the floor\nbeside him, his head in his hands, fingers pushed through curly hair.

Three\nother men stood, huddled together, their urgent whispering rebounding from\nthe walls and echoing down the hallway.\n“Aren’t you coming?”\nVitari shook her head. “He didn’t ask for me.”\nThe three men looked up at Glokta as he limped towards them. And\nwhat a group to find muttering in a palace corridor before daybreak. Lord\nChamberlain Hoff was wearing a quickly flung-on nightgown, his puffy\nface stricken as though by a nightmare. Lord Marshal Varuz had one collar\nof his rumpled shirt sticking up, the other down, his iron-grey hair shooting\noff his skull at all angles. High Justice Marovia’s cheeks were gaunt, his\neyes were rimmed with red, and there was a slight tremble to his liverish\nhand as he raised it to point at the door.\n“In there,” he whispered. “A terrible business. Terrible. Whatever shall\nbe done?”\nGlokta frowned, stepped past the sobbing guard, and limped over the\nthreshold.\nIt was a bedchamber. And a magnificent one. This is a palace, after all.\nThe walls were papered with vivid silk, hung with dark canvases in old gilt\nframes. An enormous fireplace was carved from brown-and-red stone to\nlook like a miniature Kantic temple. The bed was a monstrous four-posted\ncreation whose curtains probably enclosed more space than Glokta’s entire\nbedroom. The covers were flung back and rumpled, but there was no sign of\nthe former occupant. One tall window was standing ajar, and a chill breeze\nwashed in from the grey world outside, making the flames on the candles\ndance and flutter.\nArch Lector Sult was standing near the centre of the room, frowning\nthoughtfully down at the floor on the other side of the bed. If Glokta had\nexpected him to be as dishevelled as his three colleagues outside the door,\nhe was disappointed. His white gown was spotless, his white hair neatly\nbrushed, his white-gloved hands clasped carefully before him.\n“Your Eminence…” Glokta was saying as he shuffled up. Then he\nnoticed something on the floor. Dark fluid, glistening black in the\ncandlelight. Blood. How very unsurprising.\nHe hobbled a little further. The corpse lay on its back on the far side of\nthe bed. Blood was spattered on the white sheets, smeared over the boards\nand across the wall behind, had soaked up into the hem of the opulent\ndrapes by the window. The ripped nightshirt was soaked through with it.\nOne hand was curled up, the other was torn off, ragged, just beyond the\nthumb. There was a gaping wound on one arm, a chunk of flesh missing. As\nthough it were bitten away. One leg was broken and bent back on itself, a\nsnapped-off length of bone poking through split flesh. The throat had been\nso badly mauled that the head was barely attached, but there was no\nmistaking the face, seeming to grin up at the fine stucco work on the\nceiling, teeth bared, eyes wide, bulging open.\n“Crown Prince Raynault has been murdered,” muttered Glokta.\nThe Arch Lector raised his gloved hands and slowly, softly clapped two"

It is for just such insights that I\nsent for you. Yes, Prince Raynault has been murdered. A tragedy. An\noutrage. A terrible crime that strikes at the very heart of our nation, and at\nevery one of its people. But that is far from the worst of it.” The Arch\nLector took a long breath. “The King has no siblings, Glokta, do you\nunderstand? Now he has no heirs. When the King dies, where do you\nsuppose our next illustrious ruler will come from?”\nGlokta swallowed. I see. What a towering inconvenience. “From the\nOpen Council.”\n“An election,” sneered Sult. “The Open Council, voting for our next\nKing. A few hundred self-serving half-wits who can’t be trusted to vote for\ntheir own lunch without guidance.”\nGlokta swallowed. I would almost be enjoying His Eminence’s\ndiscomfort were my neck not on the block beside his. “We are not popular\nwith the Open Council.”\n“We are reviled by them. Few more so. Our actions against the Mercers,\nagainst the Spicers, against Lord Governor Vurms, and more besides. None\nof the nobles trust us.”\nThen if the King dies… “How is the King’s health?”\n“Not. Good.” Sult frowned down at the bloody remains. “All our work\ncould be undone at this one stroke. Unless we can make friends in the Open\nCouncil, Glokta, while the King yet lives. Unless we can curry enough\nfavour to choose his successor, or at least to influence the choice.” He stared\nat Glokta, blue eyes glittering in the candlelight. “Votes must be bought,\nand blackmailed, coaxed and threatened our way. And you can depend upon\nit that those three old bastards outside are thinking just the same thing. How\nwill I stay in power? With which candidate should I align myself? Whose\nvotes can I control? When we announce the murder, we must assure the\nOpen Council that the killer is already in our hands. Then swift, and brutal,\nand highly visible justice must be done. If the vote does not go our way,\nwho knows what we could end up with? Brock on the throne, or Isher, or\nHeugen?” Sult gave a horrified shudder. “We will be out of our jobs, at best.\nAt worst…” Several bodies found floating by the docks… “That is why I\nneed you to find me the Prince’s murderer. Now.”\nGlokta looked down at the body. Or what remained of it. He poked at\nthe gouge out of Raynault’s arm with the tip of his cane. We have seen\nwounds like these before, on that corpse in the park, months ago. An Eater\ndid this, or at least, we are meant to think so. The window tapped gently\nagainst its frame on a sudden cold draft. An Eater who climbed in through\nthe window?

A sudden loss of appetite, are we\nmeant to suppose?\n“Have you spoken to the guard?”\nSult waved his hand dismissively. “He says he stood outside the door all\nnight as usual. He heard a noise, entered the room, found the Prince as you\nsee him, still bleeding, the window open. He sent immediately for Hoff.\nHoff sent for me, and I for you.”\n“The guard should be properly questioned, nonetheless…” Glokta\npeered down at Raynault’s curled-up hand. There was something in it. He\nbent with an effort, his cane wobbling under his weight, and snatched it up\nbetween two fingers. Interesting. A piece of cloth. White cloth, it seemed,\nthough mostly stained dark red now. He flattened it out and held it up. Gold\nthread glittered faintly in the dim candlelight. I have seen cloth like this\nbefore.\n“What is that?” snapped Sult. “Have you found something?”\nGlokta stayed silent. Perhaps, but it was very easy. Almost too easy.\nG\nlokta nodded to Frost, and the albino reached forward and pulled the bag\nfrom the head of the Emperor’s envoy. Tulkis blinked in the harsh light,\ntook a deep breath, and squinted round at the room. A dirty white box, too\nbrightly lit. He took in Frost, looming at his shoulder. He took in Glokta,\nseated opposite. He took in the rickety chairs, and the stained table, and the\npolished case sitting on top of it. He did not seem to notice the small black\nhole in the very corner opposite him, behind Glokta’s head. He was not\nmeant to. That was the hole through which the Arch Lector watched the\nproceedings. The one through which he hears every word that is said.\nGlokta watched the envoy closely. It is in these early moments that a\nman often gives away his guilt. I wonder what his first words will be? An\ninnocent man would ask what crime he is accused of—\n“Of what crime am I accused?” asked Tulkis. Glokta felt his eyelid\ntwitch. Of course, a clever guilty man might easily ask the same question.\n“Of the murder of Crown Prince Raynault.”\nThe envoy blinked, and sagged back in his chair. “My deepest\ncondolences to the Royal Family, and to all the people of the Union on this\nblack day. But is all this really necessary?” He nodded down at the yards of\nheavy chain wrapped round his naked body.\n“It is. If you are what we suspect you might be.”\n“I see. Might I ask if it will make any difference that I am innocent of\nany part in this heinous crime?”\nI doubt it will. Even if you are. Glokta tossed the bloodstained fragment\nof white cloth onto the table. “This was found clasped in the Prince’s hand.”\nTulkis frowned at it, puzzled. Just as if he never saw it before. “It matches\nexactly with a tear in a garment found in your chambers. A garment also\nstained liberally with blood.” Tulkis looked up at Glokta, eyes wide. Just as"

Just as\nthough he has no idea how it got there. “How would you explain this?”\nThe envoy leaned forward across the table, as far as he could with his\nhands chained behind him, and spoke swift and low. “Please attend to me,\nSuperior. If the Prophet’s agents have discovered my mission—and they\ndiscover everything sooner or later—they will stop at nothing to make it\nfail. You know what they are capable of. If you punish me for this crime, it\nwill be an insult to the Emperor. You will slap away his hand of friendship,\nand slap him in the face besides. He will swear vengeance, and when\nUthman-ul-Dosht has sworn… my life means nothing, but my mission\ncannot fail. The consequences… for both our nations… please, Superior, I\nbeg of you… I know you for an open-minded man—”\n“An open mind is like to an open wound,” growled Glokta. “Vulnerable\nto poison. Liable to fester. Apt to give its owner only pain.” He nodded to\nFrost, and the albino placed the paper of confession carefully on the\ntabletop and slid it towards Tulkis with his white fingertips. He put the\nbottle of ink beside it and flipped open the brass lid. He placed the pen\nnearby. All neat and crisp as a Sergeant-Major could wish for.\n“This is your confession.” Glokta waved his hand at the paper. “In case\nyou were wondering.”\n“I am not guilty,” muttered Tulkis, his voice hardly more than a whisper.\nGlokta twitched his face in annoyance. “Have you ever been tortured?”\n“No.”\n“Have you ever seen torture carried out?”\nThe envoy swallowed. “I have.”\n“Then you have some inkling of what to expect.” Frost lifted the lid on\nGlokta’s case. The trays inside lifted and fanned out like a huge and\nspectacular butterfly unfurling its wings for the first time, exposing Glokta’s\ninstruments in all their glittering, hypnotic, horrible beauty. He watched\nTulkis’ eyes fill with fear and fascination.\n“I am the very best there is at this.” Glokta gave a long sigh and clasped\nhis hands before him. “It is not a matter for pride. It is a matter of fact. You\nwould not be with me now if it were otherwise. I tell you so you can have\nno doubts. So you can answer my next question with no illusions. Look at\nme.” He waited for Tulkis’ dark eyes to meet his. “Will you confess?”\nThere was a pause. “I am innocent,” whispered the ambassador.\n“That was not my question. I will ask it again. Will you confess?”\n“I cannot.”\nThey stared at each other for a long moment, and Glokta was left in no\ndoubt. He is innocent. If he could steal over the wall of the palace and in\nthrough the Prince’s window without being noticed, surely he could have\nstolen out of the Agriont and away before we were any the wiser?

He struggled out of his chair to the\ndoor, shut it carefully behind him, hobbled wincing up the steps to the next\nroom, and went in.\n“What the hell are you up to in there?” the Arch Lector snarled at him.\nGlokta kept his head bowed in a position of deep respect. “I am trying to\nestablish the truth, Your Eminence—”\n“You are trying to establish what? The Closed Council are waiting for a\nconfession, and you’re blathering about what?”\nGlokta met the Arch Lector’s glare. “What if he is not lying? What if the\nEmperor does desire peace? What if he is innocent?”\nSult stared back at him, cold blue eyes wide open with disbelief. “Did\nyou lose your teeth in Gurkhul, or your fucking mind? Who cares a shit for\ninnocent? What concerns us now is what must be done! What concerns us\nnow is what is necessary! What concerns us now is ink on paper you…\nyou…”—he was near frothing at the mouth, fists clenching and unclenching\nwith fury—“you crippled shred of a man! Make him sign, then we can be\ndone with this and get to licking arses in the Open Council!”\nGlokta bowed his head still lower. “Of course, Your Eminence.”\n“Now, is your perverse obsession with the truth going to cause me any\nmore trouble tonight? I’d rather use a needle than a spade, but I’ll dig a\nconfession out of this bastard either way! Must I send for Goyle?”\n“Of course not, Your Eminence.”\n“Just get in there, damn you, and make… him… sign!”\nG\nlokta shuffled out of his room, grumbling, stretching his neck to either\nside, rubbing his sore palms, working his aching shoulders round his ears\nand hearing the joints click. A difficult interrogation. Severard was sitting\ncross-legged on the floor opposite, his head resting against the dirty wall.\n“Has he signed?”\n“Of course.”\n“Lovely. Another mystery solved, eh, chief?”\n“I doubt it. He’s no Eater. Not like Shickel was, anyway. He feels pain,\nbelieve me.”\nSeverard shrugged. “She said the talents were different for each of\nthem.”\n“She did. She did.” But still. Glokta wiped at his runny eye, thinking.\nSomeone murdered the Prince. Someone had something to gain from his\ndeath. I would like to know who, even if no one else cares. “There are some\nquestions I still need to ask. The guard at the Prince’s chambers last night. I\nwant to speak to him.”\nThe Practical raised his brows. “Why? We’ve got the paper, haven’t\nwe?”\n“Just bring him in.”"

We’ve got the paper, haven’t\nwe?”\n“Just bring him in.”\nSeverard unfolded his legs and sprang up. “Alright, then, you’re the\nboss.” He pushed himself away from the greasy wall and sauntered off\ndown the corridor. “One Knight of the Body, coming right up.”\nHolding the Line\nD\nid you sleep?” asked Pike, scratching at the less-burned side of his\nruined face.\n“No. You?”\nThe convict-turned-Sergeant shook his head.\n“Not for days,” murmured Jalenhorm, wistfully. He shaded his eyes with\na hand and squinted up towards the northern ridge, a ragged outline of trees\nunder the iron-grey sky. “Poulder’s division already set off through the\nwoods?”\n“Before first light,” said West. “We should hear that he’s in position\nsoon. And now it looks as if Kroy’s ready to go. You have to respect his\npunctuality, at least.”\nBelow Burr’s command post, down in the valley, General Kroy’s\ndivision was moving into battle order. Three regiments of the King’s Own\nfoot formed the centre, with a regiment of levies on the higher ground on\neither wing and the cavalry just behind. It was an entirely different\nspectacle from the ragged deployment of Ladisla’s makeshift army. The\nbattalions flowed smoothly forward in tightly ordered columns: tramping\nthrough the mud, the tall grass, the patches of snow in the hollows. They\nhalted at their allotted positions and began to spread out into carefully\ndressed lines, a net of men stretching right across the valley. The chill air\nechoed with the distant thumping of their feet, the beating of their drums,\nthe clipped calls of their commanders. Everything clean and crisp and\naccording to procedure.\nLord Marshal Burr thrust aside his tent flap and strode out into the open\nair, acknowledging the salutes of the various guards and officers scattered\nabout the space in front with sharp waves of his hand.\n“Colonel,” he growled, frowning up at the heavens. “Still dry, then?”\nThe sun was a watery smudge on the horizon, the sky thick white with\nstreaks of heavy grey, darker bruises hanging over the northern ridge. “For\nthe moment, sir,” said West.\n“No word from Poulder yet?”\n“No, sir. But it might be hard going, the woods are dense.” Not as dense\nas Poulder himself, West thought, but that hardly seemed the most\nprofessional thing to say.\n“Did you eat yet?”\n“Yes, sir, thank you.” West had not eaten since last night, and even then\nnot much. The very idea of food made him feel sick.\n“Well, at least one of us did.” Burr placed a hand sourly on his stomach.\n“Damned indigestion, I can’t touch a thing.” He winced and gave a long\nburp. “Pardon me. And there they go.”\nGeneral Kroy must finally have declared himself satisfied with the\nprecise positioning of every man in his division, because the soldiers in the\nvalley had begun to move forward. A chilly breeze blew up and set the\nregimental standards, the flags of the battalions, the company ensigns"

The watery sun twinkled on sharpened blades and\nburnished armour, shone on gold braid and polished wood, glittered on\nbuckles and harnesses. All advanced smoothly together, as proud a display\nof military might as could ever have been seen. Beyond them, down the\nvalley to the east, a great black tower loomed up behind the trees. The\nnearest tower of the fortress of Dunbrec.\n“Quite the spectacle,” muttered Burr. “Fifteen thousand fighting men,\nperhaps, all told, and almost as many more up on the ridge.” He nodded his\nhead at the reserve, two regiments of cavalry, dismounted and restless down\nbelow the command post. “Another two thousand there, waiting for orders.”\nHe glanced back towards the sprawling camp: a city of canvas, of carts, of\nstacked-up boxes and barrels, spread out in the snowy valley, black figures\ncrawling around inside. “And that’s without counting all the thousands back\nthere—cooks and grooms, smiths and drivers, servants and surgeons.” He\nshook his head. “Some responsibility, all that, eh? You wouldn’t want to be\nthe fool who had to take care of all that lot.”\nWest gave a weak smile. “No, sir.”\n“It looks like…” murmured Jalenhorm, shading his eyes and squinting\ndown the valley into the sun. “Are those… ?”\n“Eye-glass!” snapped Burr, and a nearby officer produced one with a\nflourish. The Marshal flicked it open. “Well, well. Who’s this now?”\nA rhetorical question, without a doubt. There was no one else it could\nbe. “Bethod’s Northmen,” said Jalenhorm, ever willing to state the obvious.\nWest watched them rush across the open ground through the wobbling\nround window of his own eye-glass. They flowed out from the trees at the\nfar end of the valley, near to the river, spreading out like the dark stain\ncreeping from a slit wrist. Dirty grey and brown masses congealed on the\nwings. Thralls, lightly armed. In the centre better ordered ranks took shape,\ndull metal gleaming, mail and blade. Bethod’s Carls.\n“No sign of any horses.” That made West more nervous than ever. He\nhad already had one near-fatal encounter with Bethod’s cavalry, and he did\nnot care to renew the acquaintance.\n“Feels good to actually see the enemy, at last,” said Burr, voicing the\nexact opposite of West’s own feelings. “They move smartly enough, that’s\nsure.” His mouth curved up into a rare grin. “But they’re moving right\nwhere we want them to. The trap’s baited and ready to spring, eh, Captain?”\nHe passed the eye-glass to Jalenhorm, who peered through it and grinned\nhimself.\n“Right where we want them,” he echoed. West felt a good deal less\nconfident. He could clearly remember the thin line of Northmen on the\nridge, right where Ladisla had thought he wanted them.\nKroy’s men halted and the units shuffled into perfect position once"

West just made out the shouted orders to fire, saw the\nfirst volley float up from Kroy’s line, shower down in amongst the enemy.\nHe felt his nails digging painfully into his palm as he watched, fists\nclenched tight, willing the Northmen to die. Instead they sent back a well-\norganised volley of their own, and then began to surge forward.\nTheir battle cry floated up to the officers outside the tent, that unearthly\nshriek, carrying on the cold air. West chewed at his lip, remembering the\nlast time he heard it, echoing through the mist. Hard to believe it had only\nbeen a few weeks ago. Again he was guiltily glad to be well behind the\nlines, though a shiver down his back reminded him that it had done little\ngood on that occasion.\n“Bloody hell,” said Jalenhorm.\nNo one else spoke. West stood, teeth gritted, heart thumping, trying\ndesperately to hold his eye-glass steady as the Northmen charged full-\nblooded down the valley. Kroy’s flatbows gave them one more volley, then\npulled back through the carefully prepared gaps in the carefully dressed\nranks, forming up again behind the lines. Spears were lowered, shields were\nraised, and in virtual silence, it seemed, the Union line prepared to meet the\nhowling Northmen.\n“Contact,” growled Lord Marshal Burr. The Union ranks seemed to\nwave and shift somewhat, the watery sunlight seemed to flash more rapidly\non the mass of men, a vague rattling drifted on the air. Not a word was said\nin the command post. Each man was squinting through his eye-glass, or\npeering into the sun, craning to see what was happening down in the valley,\nhardly daring even to breathe.\nAfter what seemed a horribly long time, Burr lowered his eye-glass.\n“Good. They’re holding. It seems your Northmen were right, West, we have\nthe advantage in numbers, even without Poulder. When he gets here, it\nshould be a rout—”\n“Up there,” muttered West, “on the southern ridge.” Something glinted\nin the tree line, and again. Metal. “Cavalry, sir, I’d bet my life on it. It\nseems Bethod had the same idea as us, but on the other wing.”\n“Damn it!” hissed Burr. “Send word to General Kroy that the enemy has\nhorses on the southern ridge! Tell him to refuse that flank and prepare to be\nattacked from the right!” One of the adjutants leaped smoothly into his\nsaddle and galloped off in the direction of Kroy’s headquarters, cold mud\nflying from his horse’s hooves.\n“More tricks, and this may not be the last of ’em.” Burr snapped the eye-\nglass closed and thumped it into his open palm. “This must not be allowed\nto fail, Colonel West. Nothing must get in the way. Not Poulder’s"

It must not be allowed to fail!”\n“No, sir.” But West was far from sure what he could do about it.\nT\nhe Union soldiers were trying to be quiet, which meant they made about\nas much racket as a great herd of sheep being shoved indoors for shearing.\nMoaning and grunting, slithering on the wet ground, armour rattling,\nweapons knocking on low branches. Dogman shook his head as he watched\n’em.\n“Lucky thing there’s no one out here, or we’d have been heard long\nago,” hissed Dow. “These fools couldn’t creep up on a corpse.”\n“No need for you to be making noise,” hissed Threetrees, up ahead, then\nbeckoned them all forward.\nIt was a strange feeling, marching with such a big crew again. There\nwere two score of Shivers’ Carls along with ’em, and quite an assortment.\nTall men and short, young and old, all manner of different weapons and\narmour, but all pretty well seasoned, from what the Dogman could tell.\n“Halt!” And the Union soldiers clattered and grumbled to a stop, started\nsorting themselves out into a line, spread across the highest part of the\nridge. A great long line, the Dogman reckoned, judging from the number of\nmen he’d watched going up into the woods, and they were right at the far\nend of it. He peered off into the empty trees on their left, and frowned.\nLonely place to be, the end of a line.\n“But the safest,” he muttered to himself.\n“What’s that?” asked Cathil, sitting down on a great fallen tree trunk.\n“Safe here,” he said in her tongue, managing a grin. He still didn’t have\nhalf an idea how to behave around her. There was a hell of a gap between\nthem in the daylight, a yawning great gap of race, and age, and language\nthat he wasn’t sure could ever be bridged. Strange, how the gap dwindled\ndown to nothing at night. They understood each other well enough in the\ndark. Maybe they’d work it out, in time, or maybe they wouldn’t, and that’d\nbe that. Still, he was glad she was there. Made him feel like a proper human\nman again, instead of just an animal slinking in the woods, trying to scratch\nhis way from one mess to another.\nHe watched a Union officer break off from his men and walk towards\nthem, strut up to Threetrees, some kind of a polished stick wedged under his\narm. “General Poulder asks that you remain here on the left wing, to secure\nthe far flank.” He spoke slow and very loud, as though that’d make him\nunderstood if they didn’t talk the language.\n“Alright,” said Threetrees.\n“The division will be deploying along the high ground to your right!”\nAnd he flicked his stick thing towards the trees where his men were slowly\nand noisily getting ready. “We will be waiting until Bethod’s forces are well\nengaged with General Kroy’s division, and then we will attack, and drive"

Right then!” he shouted,\nturning round to the Carls. “Get hold o’ that tree trunk and drag it up along\nthe brow here!”\n“Why?” asked one of ’em, sitting rubbing at one knee and looking\nsullen.\n“So you got something to hide behind if Bethod turns up,” barked Dow\nat him. “Get to it, fool!”\nThe Carls downed their weapons and set to work, grumbling. Seemed\nthat joining up with the legendary Rudd Threetrees was less of a laugh than\nthey’d hoped. Dogman had to smile. They should’ve known. Leaders don’t\nget to be legendary by handing out light duty. The old boy himself stood\nfrowning into the woods as Dogman walked up beside him. “You worried,\nchief?”\n“It’s a good spot up here for hiding some men. A good spot for waiting\n’til the battle’s joined, then charging down.”\n“It is,” grinned the Dogman. “That’s why we’re here.”\n“And what? Bethod won’t have thought of that?” Dogman’s grin started\nto fade. “If he’s got men to spare, he might think they’d be well used up\nhere, waiting for the right moment, just like we are. He might send ’em\nthrough these trees here and up this hill to right where we’re sitting. What’d\nhappen then, d’you reckon?”\n“We’d set to killing each other, I daresay, but Bethod don’t have men to\nspare, according to Shivers and his boys. He’s outnumbered worse’n two to\none as it is.”\n“Maybe, but he likes to cook up surprises.”\n“Alright,” said Dogman, watching the Carls heaving the fallen tree trunk\naround so it blocked off the top of the slope. “Alright. So we drag a tree\nacross here and we hope for the best.”\n“Hope for the best?” grunted Threetrees. “Just when did that ever\nwork?” He strode off to mutter to Grim, and Dogman shrugged his\nshoulders. If a few hundred Carls did turn up all of a sudden, they’d be in a\nfix, but there weren’t much he could do about it now. So he knelt down\nbeside his pack, pulled out his flint and some dry twigs, stacked it all up\ncareful, and started striking sparks.\nShivers squatted down near him, palms resting on his axe-handle.\n“What’re you at?”\n“What does it look like?” Dogman blew into the kindling, watched the\nflame spreading out. “I’m making me a fire.”\n“Ain’t we waiting for a battle to start?”"

War’s all waiting, lad. Weeks of your life, maybe, if you’re in our\nline o’ work. You could spend that time being cold, or you could try to get\ncomfortable.”\nHe slid his pan out from his pack and onto the fire. New pan, and a good\none, he’d got it off the Southerners. He unwrapped the packet inside. Five\neggs there, still whole. Nice, brown, speckled eggs. He cracked one on the\nedge of the pan, poured it in, heard it hiss, grinning all the while. Things\nwere looking up, alright. Hadn’t had eggs in a good long time. It was as he\nwas cracking the last one that he smelled something, just as the breeze\nturned. Something more than eggs cooking. He jerked his head up,\nfrowning.\n“What?” asked Cathil.\n“Nothing, most likely.” But it was best not to take chances. “You wait\nhere a moment and watch these, eh?”\n“Alright.”\nDogman clambered over the fallen trunk, made for the nearest tree, and\nleaned against it, squatting on his haunches, peering down the slope.\nNothing to smell, that he could tell. Nothing to see in the trees either—just\nthe wet earth patched with snow, the dripping pine branches, and the still\nshadows. Nothing. Just Threetrees got him nervous with his talk about\nsurprises.\nHe was turning back when he caught a whiff again. He stood up, took a\nfew paces downhill, away from the fire and the fallen tree, staring into the\nwoods. Threetrees came up beside him, shield on his arm, sword drawn and\nclutched in his big fist.\n“What is it, Dogman, you smell something?”\n“Could be.” He sniffed again, long and slow, sucking the air through his\nnose, sifting at it. “Most likely nothing.”\n“Don’t nothing me, Dogman, your nose has got us out of a scrape or two\nbefore now. What d’you smell?”\nThe breeze shifted, and this time he caught it full. Hadn’t smelled it in a\nwhile, but there was no mistaking it. “Shit,” he breathed. “Shanka.”\n“Oy!” And the Dogman looked round, mouth open. Cathil was just\nclimbing over the fallen tree, the pan in her hand. “Eggs are done,” she said,\ngrinning at the two of them.\nThreetrees flailed his arm at her and bellowed at the top of his lungs.\n“Everyone get back behind the—”\nA bowstring went, down in the brush. Dogman heard the arrow, felt it\nhiss past in the air. They’re not the best of archers, on the whole, the\nFlatheads, and it missed him by a stride or two. It was just piss-poor luck it\nfound another mark."

Then\nhe was scrabbling for her arms, saw Threetrees take a hold round her knees.\nIt was a lucky thing she weren’t heavy. Not heavy at all. An arrow or two\nshot past. One stuck wobbling in the tree trunk, and they bundled her over\nand took cover on the other side.\n“There’s Shanka down there!” Threetrees was shouting, “They shot the\ngirl!”\n“Safest place in the battle?” growled Dow, crouching down behind the\ntree, spinning his axe round and round in his hand. “Fucking bastards!”\n“Shanka? This far south?” someone was saying.\nDogman took Cathil under the arms and pulled her groaning back to the\nhollow by the fire, her heels kicking at the mud. “They shot me,” she\nmuttered, staring down at the arrow, blood spreading out from it into her\nshirt. She coughed, looked up at the Dogman, eyes wide.\n“They’re coming!” Shivers was shouting. “Ready, boys!” Men were\ndrawing their weapons, tightening their belts and their shield straps, gritting\ntheir teeth and thumping each other on the backs, making ready to fight.\nGrim was up behind the tree, shooting arrows down the hill, calm as you\nlike.\n“I got to go,” said the Dogman, squeezing at Cathil’s hand, “but I’ll be\nback, alright? You just sit tight, you hear? I’ll be back.”\n“What? No!” He had to pry her fingers away from his. He didn’t like\ndoing it, but what choice did he have? “No,” she croaked at his back as he\nscrambled towards the tree and the thin line of Carls hunching down behind\nit, a couple kneeling up to shoot their own bows. An ugly spear came over\nthe trunk and thudded into the earth just beside him. Dogman stared at it,\nthen slithered past, up onto his knees not far from Grim, looking down the\nslope.\n“Fucking shit!” The trees were alive with Flatheads. The trees below, the\ntrees to their left, the trees to their right. Dark shapes moving, flapping\nshadows, swarming up the hill. Hundreds of them, it seemed like. Off to\ntheir right the Union soldiers were shouting and clattering, confused,\narmour clanking as they set their spears. Arrows hissed angry up out of the\nwoods, flitted down into ’em. “Fucking shit!”\n“Maybe start shooting, aye?” Grim loosed a shaft, pulled another out of\nhis quiver.

He wondered how a man was meant to get\nready for this.\nA Flathead came springing through the air over the tree, mouth wide\nopen and snarling. Dogman saw it there, black in the air, heard a great roar\nin his ear, then Tul’s sword ripped into it and flung it back, blood spraying\nout of it like water from a smashed bottle.\nAnother came scrambling up and Threetrees took its arm clean off with\nhis sword, smashed it back down the slope with his shield. More of ’em\nwere coming now, and still more, swarming over the fallen trunk in a\ncrowd. Dogman shot one in the face at no more than a stride away, pulled\nhis knife out and stabbed it in the gut, screaming as loud as he could, blood\nleaking warm over his hand. He tore its club from its claw as it fell and\nswung it at another, missed, and reeled away. Men were shouting and\nstabbing and hacking all over.\nHe saw Shivers wedge a Shanka’s head against the tree with his boot,\nlift his shield high above his head and ram the metal rim deep into its face.\nHe knocked another sprawling with his axe, spraying blood into Dogman’s\neyes, then caught a third in his arms as it sprang over the tree and they\nrolled onto the wet dirt together, flopping over and over. The Shanka came\nout on top, and Dogman smashed it in the back with the club, once, twice,\nthree times, and Shivers shoved it off and scrambled up, stomped on the\nback of its head. He charged past, hacking another Flathead down just as it\nspitted a squealing Carl through the side with a spear.\nDogman blinked, trying to wipe the blood from his eyes on the back of\nhis sleeve. He saw Grim lift his knife and stab it through a Flathead’s skull,\nthe blade sliding out its mouth and nailing it tight to a tree trunk. He saw\nTul smashing his great fist into a Shanka’s face, again and again until its\nskull was nothing but red pulp. A Flathead sprang up onto the tree above\nhim, spear raised, but before it could stab him, Dow leaped up and chopped\nits legs out from under it. It spun in the air, screaming.\nDogman saw a Shanka on top of a Carl, taking a great bite out of his\nneck.

He saw it in\ngood time and dodged round it, slashed it across the eyes with his knife as it\ncame past, then cracked the club down on the back of its skull, felt it crunch\nlike a breaking egg. He turned to face another. A damn big one. It opened its\njaws at him and snarled, drool running out from its teeth, a great axe in its\nclaws.\n“Come on!” he screamed at it, raising the club and the knife. Before it\ncould come at him, Threetrees had stepped up behind it and split it open\nfrom shoulder to chest. Blood spattered out and it grovelled in the mud. It\nmanaged to get up a ways, somehow, but all that did was put its face in the\nbest place for Dogman to stab his knife into.\nNow the Shanka were falling back and the Carls were shouting and\nhacking them down as they turned. The last one squawked and went for the\ntree, trying to scramble over. It gibbered as Dow’s sword hacked a bloody\ngash across its back, all red meat and splinters of white bone. It fell tangled\nover a branch, twitched and lay still, its legs dangling.\n“They’re done!” roared Shivers, his face spotted with blood under his\nlong hair. “We did ’em!”\nThe Carls cheered and shouted and shook their weapons. Leastways\nmost of ’em did. There were a couple lying still and a few more laid out\nwounded, groaning, gurgling through clenched teeth. The Dogman didn’t\nreckon they felt much like celebrating. Neither did Threetrees.\n“Shut up, you fools! They’re gone for now, but there’ll be more. That’s\nthe thing with Flatheads, there’s always more! Get them bodies out of the\nway! Salvage all the arrows we can get! We’ll need ’em before today’s\nthrough!”\nThe Dogman was already limping back towards the smouldering fire.\nCathil was lying where he’d left her, breathing fast and shallow, one hand\npressed against her ribs around the shaft. She watched him coming with\nwide, wet eyes and said nothing. He said nothing either. What was there to\nsay? He took his knife and slit her bloody shirt, from the arrow down to the\nhem, peeled it away from her until he could see the shaft. It was stuck\nbetween two ribs on the right hand side, just under her tit. Not a good place\nto get shot, if there was such a thing.\n“Is it alright?” she mumbled, teeth rattling. Her face was white as snow,\neyes feverish bright. “Is it alright?”\n“It’s alright,” he said, rubbing the dirt off her wet cheek with his thumb.\n“Don’t you fret now, eh? We’ll get it sorted.” And all the time he was"

We’ll get it sorted.” And all the time he was\nthinking, You fucking liar, Dogman, you fucking coward. She’s got an arrow\nin her ribs.\nThreetrees squatted down beside them. “It’ll have to come out,” he said,\nfrowning hard. “I’ll hold her, you pull it.”\n“Do what?”\n“What’s he saying?” hissed Cathil, blood on her teeth. “What’s he…”\nDogman took hold of the shaft in both hands while Threetrees took her\nwrists. “What’re you—”\nDogman pulled, and it wouldn’t come. He pulled, and blood ran out\nfrom the wound round the shaft and slid down her pale side in two dark\nlines. He pulled, and her body thrashed and her legs kicked and she\nscreamed like he was killing her. He pulled, and it wouldn’t come, and it\nwouldn’t even shift a finger’s breadth.\n“Pull it!” hissed Threetrees.\n“It won’t fucking come!” snarled the Dogman in his face.\n“Alright! Alright.” Dogman let go the arrow and Cathil coughed and\ngurgled, shuddering and shaking, gasping in air and dribbling out pink spit.\nThreetrees rubbed at his jaw, leaving a bloody smear across his face. “If\nyou can’t pull it out, you’ll have to push it on through.”\n“What?”\n“What’s he… saying?” gurgled Cathil, her teeth chattering.\nDogman swallowed. “We got to push it through.”\n“No,” she muttered, eyes going wide. “No.”\n“We got to.” She snorted as he took hold of the shaft and snapped it off\nhalfway down, cupped his palms over the broken end.\n“No,” she whimpered.\n“Just hold on, girl,” muttered Threetrees in common, gripping hold of\nher arms again. “Just hold on, now. Do it, Dogman.”\n“No…”\nDogman gritted his teeth and shoved down hard on the broken shaft.\nCathil jerked and made a kind of sigh, then her eyes rolled back, passed out\nclean. Dogman half rolled her, body limp as a rag, saw the arrow head\nsticking out her back.\n“Alright,” he muttered, “alright, it’s through.” He took hold of it just\nbelow the blade, twisted it gently as he slid it out. A splatter of blood came\nwith it, but not too much.\n“That’s good,” said Threetrees. “Don’t reckon it got a lung, then.”\nDogman chewed at his lip. “That’s good.” He grabbed up a roll of\nbandage, put it against the leaking hole in her back, started winding it round\nher chest, Threetrees lifting her up while he passed it underneath her.\n“That’s good, that’s good.” He said it over and over, winding the bandage\nround, fumbling fast as he could with cold fingers until it was done up tight,\nas good as he knew how. His hands were bloody, the bandage was bloody,\nher stomach and her back were covered in his pink finger marks, in streaks\nof dark dirt and dark blood.

He dragged it back, shook it\nout, and laid it over her. “Keep you warm, eh? Nice and warm.” He pushed\nit in around her, keep the cold out. He tugged it down over her feet. “Keep\nwarm.”\n“Dogman.”\nThreetrees was bending over, listening to her breath. He straightened up,\nand slowly shook his head. “She’s dead.”\n“What?”\nWhite specks drifted down round them. It was starting to snow again.\nW\nhere the hell is Poulder?” snarled Marshal Burr, staring down the valley,\nhis fists clenching and unclenching with frustration. “I said wait until we’re\nengaged, not damn well overrun!”\nWest could think of no reply. Where, indeed, was Poulder? The snow\nwas thickening now, coming down softly in swirls and eddies, letting fall a\ngrey curtain across the battlefield, lending to everything an air of unreality.\nThe sounds came up as though from impossibly far away, muffled and\nechoing. Messengers rode back and forth behind the lines, black dots\nmoving swiftly over the white ground with urgent calls for reinforcement.\nThe wounded were building up, dragged groaning in stretchers, gasping in\ncarts, or trudging, silent and bloody, down the road below the headquarters.\nEven through the snow it was clear that Kroy’s men were hard-pressed.\nThe carefully drawn lines now bulged alarmingly in the centre, units\ndissolved into a single straining mass, merged with one another in the chaos\nand confusion of combat. West had lost track of the number of staff officers\nGeneral Kroy had sent to the command post demanding support or\npermission to withdraw, all of them sent back with the same message. To\nhold, and to wait. From Poulder, meanwhile, came nothing but an ominous\nand unexpected silence.\n“Where the hell is he?” Burr stomped back to his tent leaving dark\nfootprints in the fresh crust of white. “You!” he shouted at an adjutant,\nbeckoning him impatiently. West followed at a respectful distance and\npushed through the tent flap after him, Jalenhorm just behind.\nMarshal Burr leaned over his table and snatched a pen from an ink\nbottle, spattering black drops on the wood. “Get up into those woods and\nfind General Poulder! Establish what the hell he is doing and return to me at\nonce!”\n“Yes, sir!” squawked the officer, standing to vibrating attention.\nBurr’s pen scrawled orders across the paper. “Inform him that he is\ncommanded to begin his attack immediately!” He signed his name with an\nangry slash of the wrist and jerked the paper out to the adjutant.\n“Of course, sir!” The young officer strode purposefully from the tent.\nBurr turned back to his maps, wincing as he glared down, one hand"

Commit the cavalry.”\n“Yes, sir, of course.”\n“This cannot be allowed to fail.” The Marshal frowned, swallowed. It\nseemed to West he had gone suddenly very pale. “This cannot… cannot…”\nHe swayed slightly, blinking.\n“Sir, are you—”\n“Bwaaaah!” And Marshal Burr jerked forward and sprayed black vomit\nover the tabletop. It splattered against the maps and turned the paper angry\nred. West stood frozen, his jaw gradually dropping open. Burr gurgled, fists\nclenched on the table in front of him, his body shaking, then he hunched\nover and poured out puke again. “Guuurgh!” And he lurched away, red\ndrool dangling from his lip, eyes starting from his white face, gave a\nstrangled groan, and toppled back, dragging one bloody chart with him.\nWest finally understood what was happening just in time to dive forward\nand catch the Lord Marshal’s limp body before he fell. He staggered across\nthe tent, struggling to hold him up.\n“Shit!” gasped Jalenhorm.\n“Help me, damn it!” snarled West. The big man started over and took\nBurr’s other arm, and together they half lifted, half dragged him to his bed.\nWest undid the Marshal’s top button, loosened his collar. “Some sickness of\nthe stomach,” he muttered through clenched teeth. “He’s been complaining\nfor weeks…”\n“I’ll get the surgeon!” squealed Jalenhorm.\nHe started up, but West caught hold of his arm. “No.”\nThe big man stared back. “What?”\n“If it becomes known that he’s ill, there’ll be panic. Poulder and Kroy\nwill do as they please. The army might fall apart. No one can know until\nafter the battle.”\n“But—”\nWest got up and put his hand on Jalenhorm’s shoulder, looking him\nstraight in the eye. He knew already what had to be done. He would not be\na spectator at another disaster. “Listen to me. We must follow through with\nthe plan. We must.”\n“Who must?” Jalenhorm stared wildly round the tent. “Me and you,\nalone?”\n“If that’s what it takes.”\n“But this is a man’s life!”\n“This is thousands of men’s lives,” hissed West. “It cannot be allowed to\nfail, you heard him say it.”\nJalenhorm had turned almost as pale as Burr. “I hardly think he meant\nthat—”\n“Don’t forget, you owe me.” West leaned still closer. “Without me you’d\nbe one in a pile of corpses rotting nicely north of the Cumnur.” He didn’t"

You watch Marshal Burr, I’ll take care of things outside.” West\ngot up and made for the tent flap.\n“What if he—”\n“Improvise!” he snapped over his shoulder. There were bigger things to\nworry about now than any one man. He ducked out into the cold air. At least\na score of officers and guards were scattered around the command post\nbefore the tent, pointing down into the white valley, peering through eye-\nglasses and muttering to one another. “Sergeant Pike!” West beckoned to\nthe convict and he strode over through the falling snow. “I need you to\nstand guard here, do you understand?”\n“Of course, sir.”\n“I need you to stand guard here, and admit no one but me or Captain\nJalenhorm. No one.” He dropped his voice lower. “Under any\ncircumstances.”\nPike nodded, his eyes glittering in the pink mass of his face. “I\nunderstand.” And he moved to the tent flap and stood beside it, almost\ncarelessly, his thumbs tucked into his sword belt.\nA moment later a horse plunged down the slope and into the\nheadquarters, smoke snorting from its nostrils. Its rider slid down from his\nsaddle, stumbled a couple of steps before West managed to get in his way.\n“An urgent message for Marshal Burr from General Poulder!” blathered\nthe man in a rush. He tried to take a stride towards the tent, but West did not\nmove.\n“Marshal Burr is busy. You can deliver your message to me.”\n“I was explicitly told to—”\n“To me, Captain!”\nThe man blinked. “General Poulder’s division is engaged, sir, in the\nwoods.”\n“Engaged?”\n“Hotly engaged. There have been several savage attacks on the left\nwing, and we’re hard-pressed to hold our own. General Poulder requests\npermission to withdraw and regroup, sir, we’re all out of position!”\nWest swallowed. The plan was already coming unravelled, and in\nimminent danger of falling apart completely. “Withdraw? No! Impossible.\nIf he pulls back, Kroy’s division will be left exposed. Tell General Poulder\nto hold his ground, and to go through with the attack if he possibly can. Tell\nhim he must not withdraw under any circumstances! Every man must do his\npart!”\n“But, sir, I should—”\n“Go!” shouted West. “At once!”\nThe man saluted and clambered back onto his horse. Even as he was\nspurring up the slope, another visitor was pulling up his mount not far from\nthe tent. West cursed under his breath. It was Colonel Felnigg, Kroy’s chief\nof staff. He would not be so easily put off.\n“Colonel West,” he snapped as he swung down from the saddle. “Our\ndivision is fiercely engaged all across the line, and now cavalry has"

It could be the end! Where the hell is Poulder?”\nWest attempted unsuccessfully to slow Felnigg down. “General Poulder\nhas come under attack himself. However, I will order the reserves released\nimmediately and—”\n“Not good enough,” growled Felnigg, brushing past him and striding\ntowards the tent flap. “I must speak to Marshal Burr at—”\nPike stepped out in front of him, one hand resting on the hilt of his\nsword. “The Marshal… is busy,” he whispered. His eyes bulged from his\nburned face in a manner so horribly threatening that even West felt slightly\nunnerved. There was a tense silence for a moment as the staff officer and\nthe faceless convict stared at one another.\nThen Felnigg took a hesitant step back. He blinked, licked his lips\nnervously. “Busy. I see. Well.” He took another step away. “The reserves\nwill be committed, you say?”\n“Immediately.”\n“Well then, well then… I will tell General Kroy to expect\nreinforcements.” Felnigg shoved one toe into his stirrup. “This is highly\nirregular, though.” He frowned down at the tent, at Pike, at West. “Highly\nirregular.” And he gave his horse the spurs and charged back down into the\nvalley. West watched him go, thinking that Felnigg had no idea just how\nirregular. He turned to an adjutant.\n“Marshal Burr has ordered the reserve into action on the right wing.\nThey must charge Bethod’s cavalry and drive them off. If that flank\nweakens, it will mean disaster. Do you understand?”\n“I should have written orders from the Marshal—”\n“There is no time for written orders!” roared West. “Get down there and\ndo your duty, man!”\nThe adjutant hurried obediently away down the slope towards the two\nregiments of reserves, waiting patiently in the snow. West watched him go,\nhis fingers working nervously. The men began to mount up, began to trot\ninto position for a charge. West was chewing at his lip as he turned around.\nThe officers and guards of Burr’s staff were all looking at him with\nexpressions ranging from mildly curious to downright suspicious.\nHe nodded to a couple of them as he walked back, trying to give the\nimpression that everything was routine. He wondered how long it would be\nbefore someone refused to simply take his word, before someone forced\ntheir way into the tent, before someone discovered that Lord Marshal Burr\nwas halfway to the land of the dead, and had been for some time. He\nwondered if it would happen before the lines broke in the valley, and the\ncommand post was overrun by Northmen.

West would have liked to grin back, but he didn’t\nhave it in him.\nT\nhe Dogman sat, and breathed. His back was to the fallen tree, his bow\nwas hanging loose in his fist. A sword was stuck into the wet earth beside\nhim. He’d taken it from a dead Carl, and put it to use, and he reckoned he’d\nhave more use for it before the day was out. There was blood on him—on\nhis hands, on his clothes, all over. Cathil’s, Flatheads’, his own. Wiping it\noff hardly seemed worth the effort—there’d be plenty more soon enough.\nThree times the Shanka had come up the hill now, and three times they’d\nfought them off, each fight harder than the one before. Dogman wondered if\nthey’d fight them off when they came again. He never doubted that they\nwere coming. Not for a minute. When and how many were the questions\nthat bothered him.\nThrough the trees he could hear the Union wounded screeching and\nsquealing. Lots of wounded. One of the Carls had lost his hand the last time\nthey came. Lost was the wrong word, maybe, since it got cut off with an\naxe. He’d been screaming loud just after, but now he was quiet, breathing\nsoft and wheezy. They’d strapped the stump up with a rag and a belt, and\nnow he was staring at it, with that look the wounded get sometimes. White\nand big-eyed, looking at his hacked-off wrist as if he couldn’t understand\nwhat he was seeing. As if it was a constant surprise to him.\nDogman eased himself up slow, peering over the top of the fallen tree\ntrunk. He could see the Flatheads, down in the woods. Sat there in the\nshadows. Waiting. He didn’t like seeing ’em lurking down there. Shanka\ncome at you until they’re finished, or they run.\n“What are they waiting for?” he hissed. “When did bloody Flatheads\nlearn to wait?”\n“When did they learn to fight for Bethod?” growled Tul, wiping his\nsword clean. “There’s a lot that’s changing, and none of it for the better.”\n“When did anything change for the better?” snarled Dow from further\ndown the line.\nDogman frowned. There was a new smell in his nose, like damp. There\nwas something pale, down in the trees, getting paler while he watched.\n“What is that? That mist?”\n“Mist? Up here?” Dow chuckled harsh as a crow calling. “This time of\nday? Hah! Hold on, though…” They could all see it now—a trace of white,\nclinging to the wet slope. Dogman swallowed. His mouth was dry. He was\nfeeling uneasy, all of a sudden, and not just from the Shanka waiting down\nthere. Something else. The mist was creeping up through the trees, curling\nround the trunks, rising while they watched. The Flatheads were starting to\nmove, dim shapes shifting in the grey murk.\n“Don’t like this,” he heard Dow saying. “This ain’t natural.”\n“Steady, lads!” Threetrees’ deep voice. “Steady, now!” Dogman took"

He rocked back and forth,\nfeeling sick.\n“No, no,” whispered Shivers, his eyes sliding around like he was\nlooking for a way out. Dogman could feel the hairs on his own arms rising,\nhis skin prickling, his throat closing up tight. A nameless sort of a fear was\ntaking him, flowing up the hillside along with the mist—creeping through\nthe forest, swirling round the trees, sliding under the trunk they were using\nas cover.\n“It’s him,” whispered Shivers, his eyes open wide as a pair of boot tops,\nsquashing himself down like he was scared of being heard. “It’s him!”\n“Who?” croaked Dogman.\nShivers just shook his head and pressed himself to the cold earth. The\nDogman felt a powerful need to do the same, but he forced himself to rise\nup, forced himself to take a look over the tree. A Named Man, scared as a\nchild in the dark, and not knowing why? Better to face it, he thought. Big\nmistake.\nThere was a shadow in the mist, too tall and too straight for a Shanka. A\ngreat, huge man, big as Tul. Bigger even. A giant. Dogman rubbed his sore\neyes, thinking it must be some trick of the light in all that gloom, but it\nwasn’t. He came on closer, this shadow, and he took on more shape, and\nmore, and the clearer he got, the worse grew the fear.\nHe’d been long and far, the Dogman, all over the North, but he’d never\nseen so strange and unnatural a thing as this giant. One half of him was\ncovered in great plates of black armour—studded and bolted, beaten and\npointed, spiked and hammered and twisted metal. The other half was mostly\nbare, apart from the straps and belts and buckles that held the armour on.\nBare foot, bare arm, bare chest, all bulging out with ugly slabs and cords of\nmuscle. A mask was on his face, a mask of scarred black iron.\nHe came on closer, and he rose from the mist, and the Dogman saw the\ngiant’s skin was painted. Marked blue with tiny letters. Scrawled across\nwith writing, every inch of him. No weapon, but he was no less terrible for\nthat. He was more, if anything. He scorned to carry one, even on a\nbattlefield.\n“By the fucking dead,” breathed the Dogman, and his mouth hung wide\nwith horror.\n“Steady, lads,” growled Threetrees. “Steady.” The old boy’s voice was\nthe only thing stopping the Dogman from running for it, and never coming\nback.\n“It’s him!” squealed one of the Carls, voice shrill as a girl’s. “It’s the\nFeared!”\n“Shut your fucking hole!” came Shivers’ voice, “We know what it is!”\n“Arrows!” shouted Threetrees.\nDogman’s hands were trembling as he took an aim on the giant.

It was\nhard somehow, to do it, even from this distance. He had to make his hand\nlet go the string, and then the arrow pinged off the armour and away into the\ntrees, harmless. Grim’s shot was better. His shaft sank clean into the giant’s\nside, buried deep in his painted flesh. He seemed not even to notice. More\narrows shot over from the Carls’ bows. One hit him in the shoulder, another\nstuck right through his huge calf. The giant made not a sound. He came on,\nsteady as the grass growing, and the mist, and the Flatheads, and the fear\ncame with him.\n“Fuck,” muttered Grim.\n“It’s a devil!” one of the Carls screeched. “A devil from hell!” Dogman\nwas starting to think the same thing. He felt the fear growing up all round\nhim, felt the men starting to waver. He felt himself edging backwards,\nalmost without thinking about it.\n“Alright, now!” bellowed Threetrees, voice deep and steady as if he felt\nno fear at all. “On the count of three! On the count of three, we charge!”\nDogman stared over as if the old boy had lost his reason. At least they\nhad a tree to hide behind up here. He heard a couple of the Carls muttering,\nno doubt thinking much the same. They didn’t much like the sound of this\nfor a plan, charging down a hill into a great crowd of Shanka, some\nunnatural giant at the heart of ’em.\n“You sure about this?” Dogman hissed.\nThreetrees didn’t even look at him. “Best thing for a man to do when\nhe’s afeared is charge! Get the blood up, and turn the fear to fury. The\nground’s on our side, and we ain’t waiting here for ’em!”\n“You sure?”\n“We’re going,” said Threetrees, turning away.\n“We’re going,” growled Dow, glaring round at the Carls, daring ’em to\nback down.\n“On three!” rumbled the Thunderhead.\n“Uh,” said Grim. Dogman swallowed, still not sure whether he’d be\ngoing or not. Threetrees peered over the trunk, his mouth a hard, flat line,\nwatching the figures in the mist, and the great big one in the midst of ’em,\nhis hand down flat behind him to say wait. Waiting for the right distance.\nWaiting for the right time.\n“Do I go on three?” whispered Shivers. “Or after three?”\nDogman shook his head. “Don’t hardly matter, as long as you go.” But\nhis feet felt like they were two great stones.\n“One!”\nOne already? Dogman looked over his shoulder, saw Cathil’s body lying\nstretched out under his blanket near the dead fire. Should have made him\nfeel angry maybe, but it only made him feel more scared. Fact was, he’d no\nwish to end up like her. He swallowed and turned away, clutched tight to\nthe handle of his knife, to the grip of the sword he’d borrowed off the dead."

You just have to go.\n“Two!”\nAlmost time. He felt his eyes opening wide, his nose sucking in cold air,\nhis skin tingling cold. He smelled men and sharp pine trees, Shanka and\ndamp mist. He heard quick breath behind, slow footsteps down below,\nshouts from along the line, his own blood thumping in his veins. He saw\nevery bit of everything, all going slow as dripping honey. Men moved\naround him, hard men with hard faces, shifting their weight, pushing\nforward against the fear and the mist, making ready. They were going to go,\nhe’d no doubt left of it. They were all going to go. He felt the muscles in his\nlegs begin to squeeze, pushing him up.\n“Three!”\nThreetrees was first over the trunk and the Dogman was just behind,\nmen all round him charging, and the air full of their shouts and their fury\nand their fear, and he was running, and screaming, feet pounding and\nshaking his bones, breath and wind rushing, black trees and white sky\ncrashing and wobbling, mist flying up at him and dark shapes inside the\nmist, waiting.\nHe swung his sword at one as he roared past, and the blade chopped\ndeep into it and threw it back, turned the Dogman half round, and he went\nalong, spinning, falling, shouting. The blade hacked deep into a Shanka’s\nleg and snatched it off its feet, and Dogman spilled down the slope,\nslithering around in the slush, trying to right himself. The sounds of fighting\nwere all round, muffled and strange. Men bellowing curses, and Shanka\nsnarling, and the rattles and thuds of iron on iron and iron in flesh.\nHe spun about, sliding between the trees, not knowing where the next\nFlathead might come from, not knowing whether he might get a spear in his\nback any minute. He saw a shape in the murk and sprang forward at it,\nshouting as hard as he could. The mist seemed to lift away in front of him,\nand he slithered to a horrified stop, the sound rattling out in his throat,\nnearly falling over backwards in his hurry to get away.\nThe Feared was no more than five strides from him, bigger and more\nterrible than ever, broken arrows sticking from his tattooed flesh all over.\nDidn’t help that he had a Carl round the neck, out at arm’s length, kicking\nand struggling. The painted sinews in his forearm twisted and squirmed and\nthe huge fingers tightened, and the Carl’s eyes bulged, and his mouth\nopened and no sound came out. There was a crunch, and the giant tossed the\ncorpse away like a rag, and it turned over and over in the snow and the\nmud, head flopping about, and lay still.\nThe Feared stood, mist flowing round him, looking down at the Dogman\nfrom behind his black mask, and the Dogman looked back, halfway to"

Better to do ’em, than to live with the\nfear of ’em. That’s what Logen would have said. So the Dogman opened his\nmouth, and screamed as loud as he could, and he charged, swinging the\nborrowed sword over his head.\nThe giant lifted his great iron-plated arm and caught the blade. Metal\nclanged on metal and rattled the Dogman’s teeth, tore the sword away and\nsent it spinning, but he stabbed with his knife at the same moment and\nslipped it under the giant’s arm, ramming it right to the hilt in his tattooed\nside.\n“Hah!” shouted the Dogman, but he didn’t get long to celebrate. The\nFeared’s huge arm flashed through the mist, caught him a backhand across\nthe chest, and flung him gurgling through the air. The woods reeled and a\ntree came out of nowhere, crashed into his back, and sent him sprawling in\nthe mud. He tried to get a breath and couldn’t. Tried to roll over and\ncouldn’t. Pain crushed his ribs, like a great rock pressing on his chest.\nHe looked up, hands clutching at the mud, hardly enough breath in him\neven to groan. The Feared was walking to him, no rush. He reached down\nand pulled the knife out of his side. It looked like a toy between his huge\nfinger and thumb. Like a toothpick. He flicked it away into the trees, a long\ndrip of blood going with it. He lifted his great armoured foot, ready to\nstomp down on the Dogman’s head and crush his skull like a nut on an\nanvil, and Dogman could only lie there, helpless with pain and fear as the\ngreat shadow fell across his face.\n“You bastard!” And Threetrees came flying out of the trees, crashed into\nthe giant’s armoured hip with his shield, and knocked him sideways, the\nhuge metal boot squelching into the dirt just beside the Dogman’s face and\nspattering him with mud. The old boy pressed in, hacking away at the\nFeared’s bare side while he was off balance, snarling and cursing at him\nwhile the Dogman gasped and squirmed, trying to get up and only making it\nas far as sitting, back to the tree.\nThe giant threw his armoured fist hard enough to bring a house down,\nbut Threetrees got round it and turned it off his shield, brought his sword up\nand over and knocked a fearsome dent in the Feared’s mask, snapping his\ngreat head back and making him stagger, blood splattering from the mouth\nhole. The old boy pressed in quick and slashed hard across the plates on the\ngiant’s chest, blade striking sparks from the black iron and carving a great\ngash into the bare blue flesh beside it. A killing blow, no doubt, but only a\nfew specks of blood flew off the swinging blade, and it left no wound at all.\nThe giant found his balance now, and he gave a great bellow that left\nDogman trembling with fear.

It crashed into Threetrees’ shield and\nripped a chunk out of the edge, split the timbers and went on through,\nthudded into the old boy’s shoulder and flung him groaning onto his back.\nThe Feared pressed in on top of him, lifting his big blue fist up high.\nThreetrees snarled and stabbed his sword clean through his tattooed thigh\nright to the hilt. Dogman saw the point slide bloody out the back of his leg,\nbut it didn’t even slow him. That great hand dropped down and crunched\ninto Threetrees’ ribs with a sound like dry sticks breaking.\nDogman groaned, clawing at the dirt, but his chest was on fire and he\ncouldn’t get up, and he couldn’t do anything but watch. The Feared lifted up\nhis other fist now, covered in black iron. He lifted it up slow and careful,\nwaited up high, then brought it whistling down, smashed it into Threetrees’\nother side and crushed him sighing into the dirt. The great arm went up\nagain, red blood on blue knuckles.\nAnd a black line came out of the mist and stabbed into the Feared’s\narmpit, shoving him over sideways. Shivers, with a spear, jabbing at the\ngiant and shouting, pushing him across the slope. The Feared rolled and\nslithered up, faked a step back and flicked out his hand quick as a massive\nsnake, slapped Shivers away like a man might swat a fly, squawking and\nkicking into the mist.\nBefore the giant could follow him, there was a roar like thunder and\nTul’s sword crashed into his armoured shoulder and flung him down on one\nknee. Now Dow came out of the mist, slashed a great chunk out of his leg\nfrom behind. Shivers was up again, snarling and jabbing with his spear, and\nthe three of ’em seemed to have the giant penned in.\nHe should’ve been dead, however big he was. The wounds Threetrees,\nand Shivers, and Dow had given him, he should have been mud. Instead he\nrose up again, six arrows and Threetrees’ sword stuck through his flesh, and\nhe let go a roar from behind his iron mask that made Dogman tremble to his\ntoes. Shivers fell back on his arse, going white as milk. Tul blinked and\nfaltered and let his sword drop. Even Black Dow took a step away.\nThe Feared reached down and took hold of the hilt of Threetrees’ sword.\nHe slid it out from his leg and let it drop bloody in the dirt at his feet. It left\nno wound behind. No wound at all. Then he turned and sprang away into\nthe gloom, and the mist closed in behind him, and the Dogman heard the\nsounds of him crashing away through the trees, and he was never so glad to\nsee the back of anything.\n“Come ’ere!” Dow screamed, making ready to tear down the slope after\nhim, but Tul got in his way with one big hand held up.\n“You’re going nowhere.

We don’t know how many Shanka there are\ndown there. We can kill that thing another day.”\n“Out o’ my way, big lad!”\n“No.”\nDogman rolled forward, wincing all the way at the pain in his chest,\nstarted clawing his way up the slope. The mist was already spilling back,\nleaving the cold, clear air behind. Grim was coming down the other way,\nbowstring drawn back with an arrow nocked. There were a lot of corpses in\nthe mud and the snow. Shanka mostly, and a couple of Carls.\nSeemed to take the Dogman an age to drag himself up to Threetrees. The\nold boy was lying on his back in the mud, one arm lying still with his\nbroken shield strapped to it. Air was snorting in shallow through his nose,\nbubbling back out bloody from his mouth. His eyes rolled down to Dogman\nas he crawled up next to him, and he reached out and grabbed a hold of his\nshirt, pulled him down, hissing in his ear through clenched-tight, bloody\nteeth.\n“Listen to me, Dogman! Listen!”\n“What, chief?” croaked Dogman, hardly able to talk for the pain in his\nchest. He waited, and he listened, and nothing came. Threetrees’ eyes were\nwide open, staring up at the branches. A drop of water splattered on his\ncheek, ran down into his bloody beard. Nothing else.\n“Back to the mud,” said Grim, face hanging slack as old cobwebs.\nW\nest chewed at his fingernails as he watched General Kroy and his staff\nriding up the road, a group of dark-dressed men on dark horses, solemn as a\nprocession of undertakers. The snow had stopped, for now, but the sky was\nangry black, the light so bad it felt like evening, and an icy wind was\nblowing through the command post making the fabric of the tent snap and\nrustle. West’s borrowed time was almost done.\nHe felt a sudden impulse, almost overpowering, to turn and run. An\nimpulse so ludicrous that he immediately had another, equally\ninappropriate, to burst out laughing. Luckily, he was able to stop himself\nfrom doing either. Lucky to stop himself from laughing, at least. This was\nfar from a laughing matter. As the clattering hooves came closer, he was left\nwondering whether the idea of running was such a foolish one after all.\nKroy pulled his black charger up savagely and climbed down, jerked his\nuniform smooth, adjusted his sword belt, turned sharply, and came on\ntowards the tent. West intercepted him, hoping to get the first word in and\nbuy a few more moments. “General Kroy, well done, sir, your division\nfought with great tenacity!”\n“Of course they did, Colonel West.” Kroy sneered the name as though he\nwere delivering a mortal insult, his staff gathering into a menacing half\ncircle behind him.\n“And might I ask our situation?”\n“Our situation?” snarled the General. “Our situation is that the\nNorthmen are driven off, but not routed.

We gave them a mauling, in the\nend, but my units were fought out, every man. Too weary to pursue. The\nenemy have been able to withdraw across the fords, thanks to Poulder’s\ncowardice! I mean to see him cashiered in disgrace! I mean to see him\nhanged for treason! I will see it done, on my honour!” He glowered around\nthe headquarters while his men muttered angrily amongst themselves.\n“Where is Lord Marshal Burr? I demand to see the Lord Marshal!”\n“Of course. If you could just give me…” West’s words were smothered\nby the mounting noise of more rushing hooves, and a second group of riders\ncareered around the side of the Marshal’s tent. Who else but General\nPoulder, accompanied by his own enormous staff. A cart pulled into the\nheadquarters along with them, crowding the narrow space with beasts and\nmen. Poulder vaulted down from his saddle and hastened through the dirt.\nHis hair was in disarray, his jaw was locked tight, there was a long scratch\ndown his cheek. His crimson entourage followed behind him: steels rattling,\ngold braid flapping, faces flushed.\n“Poulder!” hissed Kroy. “You’ve some nerve showing your face in front\nof me! Some nerve! The only damn nerve you’ve shown all day!”\n“How dare you!” screeched Poulder. “I demand an apology! Apologise\nat once!”\n“Apologise? Me, apologise? Hah! You’ll be the one saying sorry, I’ll see\nto it! The plan was for you to come in from the left wing! We were hard-\npressed for more than two hours!”\n“Almost three hours, sir,” chipped in one of Kroy’s staff, unhelpfully.\n“Three hours, damn it! If that is not cowardice, I fumble for the\ndefinition!”\n“Cowardice?” shrieked Poulder. A couple of his staff went as far as to\nplace their hands on their steels. “You will apologise to me immediately!\nMy division came under a brutal and sustained attack upon our flank! I was\nobliged to lead a charge myself! On foot!” And he thrust forward his cheek\nand indicated the scratch with one gloved finger. “It was we who did all the\nfighting! We who won the victory here today!”\n“Damn you, Poulder, you did nothing! The victory belongs to my men\nalone! An attack? An attack from what? From animals of the forest?”\n“Ah-ha! Exactly so! Show him!”\nOne of Poulder’s staff ripped back the oilskin on the cart, displaying\nwhat seemed at first to be a heap of bloody rags. He wrinkled up his nose\nand shoved it forward. The thing flopped off onto the ground, rolled onto its\nback, and stared up at the sky with beetling black eyes. A huge, misshapen\njaw hung open, long, sharp teeth sticking every which way. Its skin was a\ngreyish-brown colour, rough and calloused, its nose was an ill-formed stub.\nIts skull was flattened and hairless with a heavy ridge of brow and a small,"

One of its arms was short and muscular, the other much\nlonger and slightly bent, both ending in clawlike hands. The whole creature\nseemed lumpen, twisted, primitive. West gawped down at it, open-mouthed.\nPlainly, it was not human.\n“There!” squealed Poulder in triumph. “Now tell us my division didn’t\nfight! There were hundreds of these… these creatures out there! Thousands,\nand they fight like mad things! We only just managed to hold our ground,\nand it’s damn lucky for you that we did! I demand!” he frothed, “I\ndemand!” he ranted, “I demand!” he shrieked, face turning purple, “An\napology!”\nKroy’s eyes twitched with incomprehension, with anger, with\nfrustration. His lips twisted, his jaw worked, his fists clenched. Clearly there\nwas no entry in the rule book for a situation such as this. He rounded on\nWest.\n“I demand to see Marshal Burr!” he snarled.\n“As do I!” screeched Poulder shrilly, not to be outdone.\n“The Lord Marshal is…” West’s lips moved silently. He had no ideas\nleft. No strategies, no ruses, no schemes. “He is…” There would be no\nretreat across the fords for him. He was finished. More than likely he would\nend up in a penal colony himself. “He is—”\n“I am here.”\nAnd to West’s profound amazement, Burr was standing in the entrance\nto his tent. Even in the half-light, it seemed obvious that he was terribly ill.\nHis face was ashen pale and there was a sheen of sweat across his forehead.\nHis eyes were sunken and ringed with black. His lip quivered, his legs were\nunsteady, he clutched at the tent pole beside him for support. West could see\na dark stain down the front of his uniform that looked very much like blood.\n“I am afraid I have been… somewhat unwell during the battle,” he\ncroaked. “Something I ate, perhaps.” His hand trembled on the pole, and\nJalenhorm lurked near his shoulder, ready to catch him if he fell, but by\nsome superhuman effort of will the Lord Marshal stayed on his feet. West\nglanced nervously at the angry gathering, wondering what they might make\nof this walking corpse. But the two Generals were far too caught up in their\nown feud to pay any attention to that.\n“Lord Marshal, I must protest about General Poulder—”\n“Sir, I demand that General Kroy apologise—”\nThe best form of defence seemed to West to be an immediate attack. “It\nwould be traditional,” he cut in at the top of his voice, “for us first to\ncongratulate our commanding officer on his victory!” He began to clap,\nslowly and deliberately. Pike and Jalenhorm joined him without delay.\nPoulder and Kroy exchanged an icy glance, then they too raised their hands.\n“May I be the first to—”\n“The very first to congratulate you, Lord Marshal!”\nTheir staffs joined in, and others around the tent, and then more further"

West slunk backwards, away from the attention,\naway from the glory. He had not the slightest interest in it. That had been\nclose, he knew, impossibly close. His hands were trembling, his mouth\ntasted sour, his vision was swimming. He could still hear Poulder and Kroy,\nalready arguing again, like a pair of furious ducks quacking.\n“We must move on Dunbrec immediately, a swift assault while they are\nunwary and—”\n“Pah! Foolishness! The defences are too strong. We must surround the\nwalls and prepare for a lengthy—”\n“Nonsense! My division could carry the place tomorrow!”\n“Rubbish! We must dig in! Siegecraft is my particular area of expertise!”\nAnd on, and on. West rubbed his fingertips in his ears, trying to block\nout the voices as he stumbled through the churned-up mud. A few paces\nfurther on and he clambered around a rocky outcrop, pressed his back to it,\nand slowly slid down. Slid down until he was sitting hunched in the snow,\nhugging his knees, the way he used to do when he was a child and his father\nwas angry.\nDown in the valley, in the gathering gloom, he could see men moving\nover the battlefield. Already starting to dig the graves.\nA Fitting Punishment\nI\nt had been raining, not long ago, but it had stopped. The paving of the\nSquare of Marshals was starting to dry, the flagstones light round the edges,\ndark with damp in the centres. A ray of watery sun had finally broken\nthrough the clouds and was glinting on the bright metal of the chains\nhanging from the frame, on the blades, and hooks, and pincers of the\ninstruments on their rack. Fine weather for it, I suppose. It should be quite\nthe event. Unless your name is Tulkis, of course, then it might be one you’d\nrather miss.\nThe crowd were certainly anticipating a thrill. The wide square was full\nof their chattering, a heady mixture of excitement and anger, happiness and\nhate. The public area was packed shoulder to shoulder, and still filling, but\nthere was ample room here in the government enclosure, fenced in and well\nguarded right in front of the scaffold. The great and the good must have the\nbest view, after all. Over the shoulders of the row in front he could see the\nchairs where the members of the Closed Council were sitting. If he went up\non his toes, an operation he dared not try too often, he could just see the\nArch Lector’s shock of white hair, stirred gracefully by the breeze.\nHe glanced sideways at Ardee.

The time was I would\ntake young women to the finest establishments in the city, to the pleasure\ngardens on the hill, to concerts at the Hall of Whispers, or straight to my\nquarters, of course, if I thought I could manage it. Now I take them to\nexecutions. He felt the tiniest of smiles at the corner of his mouth. Ah well,\nthings change.\n“How will it be done?” she asked him.\n“He’ll be hung and emptied.”\n“What?”\n“He will be lifted up by chains around his wrists and neck, not quite\ntight enough to kill him through strangulation. Then he will be opened with\na blade, and gradually disembowelled. His entrails will be displayed to the\ncrowd.”\nShe swallowed. “He’ll be alive?”\n“Possibly. Hard to say. Depends whether the executioners do their job\nproperly. Anyway, he won’t live long.” Not without his guts.\n“Seems… extreme.”\n“It is meant to be. It was the most savage punishment our savage\nforebears could dream up. Reserved for those who attempt harm to the royal\nperson. Not carried out, I understand, for some eighty years.”\n“Hence the crowd.”\nGlokta shrugged. “It’s a curiosity, but you always get a good showing\nfor an execution. People love to see death. It reminds them that however\nmean, however low, however horrible their lives become… at least they\nhave one.”\nGlokta felt a tap on his shoulder and looked round, with some pain, to\nsee Severard’s masked face hovering just behind him. “I dealt with that\nthing. That thing about Vitari.”\n“Huh. And?”\nSeverard’s eyes slid suspiciously sideways to Ardee, then he leaned\nforward to whisper in Glokta’s ear. “I followed her to a house, down below\nGalt’s Green, near the market there.”\n“I know it. And?”\n“I took a peek in through a window.”\nGlokta raised an eyebrow. “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you? What was\nin there?”\n“Children.”\n“Children?” muttered Glokta.\n“Three little children. Two girls and a boy. And what colour do you\nsuppose their hair was?”\nYou don’t say. “Not flaming red, by any chance?”\n“Just like their mother.”\n“She’s got children?” Glokta licked thoughtfully at his gums. “Who’d\nhave thought it?”\n“I know. I thought that bitch had a block of ice for a cunt.”\nThat explains why she was so keen to get back from the South. All that\ntime, she had three little ones waiting. The mothering instinct. How terribly\ntouching. He wiped some wet from beneath his stinging left eye. “Well\ndone, Severard, this could be useful. What about that other thing? The\nPrince’s guard?”\nSeverard lifted his mask for a moment and scratched underneath it, eyes\ndarting nervously around. “That’s a strange one. I tried, but… it seems he’s\ngone missing.”\n“Missing?”\n“I spoke to his family. They haven’t seen him since the day before the\nPrince died.”\nGlokta frowned. “The day before?” But he was there… I saw him. “Get"

Get me a list of everyone who was in the palace that\nnight. Every lord, every servant, every soldier. I am getting to the truth of\nthis.” One way or another.\n“Did Sult tell you to?”\nGlokta looked round sharply. “He didn’t tell me not to. Just get it done.”\nSeverard muttered something, but his words were lost as the noise of the\ncrowd suddenly swelled in a wave of angry jeering. Tulkis was being led\nout onto the scaffold. He shuffled forward, chains rattling round his ankles.\nHe did not cry or wail, nor did he yell in defiance. He simply looked drawn,\nand sad, and in some pain. There were light bruises round his face, tracks of\nangry red spots down his arms and legs, across his chest. Impossible to use\nhot needles without leaving some marks, but he looks well, considering. He\nwas naked aside from a cloth tied round his waist. To spare the delicate\nsensibilities of the ladies present. Watching a man’s entrails spilling out is\nexcellent entertainment, but the sight of his cock, well, that would be\nobscene.\nA clerk stepped to the front of the scaffold and started reading out the\nprisoner’s name, the nature of the charge, the terms of his confession, and\nhis punishment, but even at this distance he could hardly be heard for the\nsullen muttering of the crowd, punctuated by an occasional furious scream.\nGlokta grimaced and worked his leg slowly back and forth, trying to loosen\nthe cramping muscles.\nThe masked executioners stepped forward and took hold of the prisoner,\nmoving with careful skill. They pulled a black bag over the envoy’s head,\nsnapped manacles shut around his neck, his wrists, his ankles. Glokta could\nsee the canvas moving in and out in front of his mouth. The desperate last\nbreaths. Does he pray, now? Does he curse and rage? Who can know, and\nwhat difference can it make?\nThey hoisted him up into the air, spread-eagled on the frame. Most of\nhis weight was on his arms. Enough on the collar round his neck to choke\nhim, not quite enough to kill. He struggled somewhat, of course. Entirely\nnatural. An animal instinct to climb, to writhe, to wriggle out and breathe\nfree. An instinct that cannot be resisted. One of the executioners went to the\nrack, pulled out a heavy blade, displayed it to the crowd with a flourish, the\nthin sun flashing briefly on its edge. He turned his back on the audience,\nand began to cut.\nThe crowd went silent. Almost deathly still, aside from the odd hushed\nwhisper. It was a punishment which brooked no calling out. A punishment\nwhich demanded awestruck silence. A punishment to which there could be\nno response other than a horrified, fascinated staring. That is its design. So\nthere was only silence, and perhaps the wet gurgling of the prisoner’s\nbreath. Since the collar makes screaming impossible.\n“A fitting punishment, I suppose,” whispered Ardee as she watched the"

Since the collar makes screaming impossible.\n“A fitting punishment, I suppose,” whispered Ardee as she watched the\nenvoy’s bloody gut slithering out of his body, “for the murderer of the\nCrown Prince.”\nGlokta bowed his head to whisper in her ear. “I’m reasonably sure that\nhe did not kill anyone. I suspect he is guilty of nothing more than being a\ncourageous man, who came to us speaking truth and holding out the hand of\npeace.”\nHer eyes widened. “Then why hang him?”\n“Because the Crown Prince has been murdered. Someone has to hang.”\n“But… who really killed Raynault?”\n“Someone who wants no peace between Gurkhul and the Union.\nSomeone who wants the war between us to grow, and spread, and never\nend.”\n“Who could want that?”\nGlokta said nothing. Who indeed?\nY\nou don’t have to admire that Fallow character, but he can certainly pick a\ngood chair. Glokta settled back into the soft upholstery with a sigh,\nstretching his feet out towards the fire, working his aching ankles round and\nround in clicking circles.\nArdee did not seem quite so comfortable. But then, this morning’s\ndiversion was hardly a comforting spectacle. She stood frowning out of the\nwindow, thoughtful, one hand pulling nervously at a strand of hair. “I need\na drink.” She went to the cabinet and opened it, took out a bottle and a\nglass. She paused, and looked round. “Aren’t you going to tell me it’s a\nlittle early in the day?”\nGlokta shrugged. “You know what the time is.”\n“I need something, after that…”\n“Then have something. You don’t need to explain yourself to me. I’m\nnot your brother.”\nShe jerked her head round and gave him a hard look, opened her mouth\nas though about to speak, then she shoved the bottle angrily away and the\nglass after it, snapped the doors of the cabinet shut. “Happy?”\nHe shrugged. “About as close as I get, since you ask.”\nArdee dumped herself into a chair opposite, staring sourly down at one\nshoe. “What happens now?”\n“Now? Now we will delight each other with humorous observations for\na lazy hour, then a stroll into town?” He winced. “Slowly, of course. Then a\nlate lunch, perhaps, I was thinking of—”\n“I meant about the succession.”\n“Oh,” muttered Glokta. “That.” He reached round and dragged a cushion\ninto a better position, then stretched out further with a satisfied grunt. One\ncould almost pretend, sitting in this warm and comfortable room, in such\nattractive and agreeable company, that one still had some kind of life. He\nnearly had a smile on his face as he continued. “There will be a vote in\nOpen Council. Meaning, I have no doubt, that there will be an orgy of\nblackmail, bribery, corruption, and betrayal. A carnival of deal making,\nalliance breaking, intrigue, and murder. A merry dance of fixing, of rigging,\nof threats, and of promises. It will go on until the King dies. Then there will\nbe a vote in Open Council.”"

Are there any?”\nGlokta raised an eyebrow. “I believe I could point out a couple.” She\nlaughed, and he congratulated himself on it. “There are rumours, of course,\nas there always are. Carmee dan Roth, have you heard of her? A lady-at-\ncourt, and reckoned an exceptional beauty. She was quite a favourite with\nthe King at one point, years ago. She disappeared suddenly and was later\nsaid to have died, perhaps in childbirth, but who can say? People love to\ngossip, and beautiful young women will die from time to time, without ever\nbearing a royal bastard.”\n“Oh, it’s true, it’s true!” Ardee fluttered her eyelashes and pretended to\nswoon. “We certainly are a sickly breed.”\n“You are, my dear, you are. Looks are a curse. I thank my stars every\nday to have been cured of that.” And he leered his toothless grin at her.\n“Members of the Open Council are flooding to the city in their scores, and I\ndaresay many of them have never set foot in the Lords’ Round in their lives.\nThey smell power, and they want to be a part of it. They want to get\nsomething out of it, while there’s something to be had. It might well be the\nonly time in ten generations that the nobles get to make a real decision.”\n“But what a decision,” muttered Ardee, shaking her head.\n“Indeed. The race could be lengthy and the competition near the front\nwill be savage.” If not to say lethal. “I would not like to discount the\npossibility of some outsider coming up at the last moment. Someone\nwithout enemies. A compromise candidate.”\n“What about the Closed Council?”\n“They’re forbidden from standing, of course, to ensure impartiality.” He\nsnorted. “Impartiality! What they passionately want is to foist some nobody"

What they passionately want is to foist some nobody\non the nation. Someone they can dominate and manipulate, so they can\ncontinue their private feuds uninterrupted.”\n“Is there such a candidate?”\n“Anyone with a vote is an option, so in theory there are hundreds, but of\ncourse the Closed Council cannot agree on one, and so they scramble with\nscant dignity behind the stronger candidates, changing their loyalties day by\nday, hoping to ensure their futures, doing their best to stay in office. Power\nhas shifted so quickly from them to the nobles, their heads are spinning.\nAnd some of them will roll one way or another, you may depend on that.”\n“Will yours roll, do you think?” asked Ardee, looking up at him from\nunder her dark brows.\nGlokta licked slowly at his gums. “If Sult’s does, it may well be that\nmine will follow.”\n“I hope not. You’ve been kind to me. Kinder than anyone else. Kinder\nthan I deserve.” It was a trick of utter frankness that he had seen her use\nbefore, but still an oddly disarming one.\n“Nonsense,” mumbled Glokta, wriggling his shoulders in the chair,\nsuddenly awkward. Kindness, honesty, comfortable living rooms… Colonel\nGlokta would have known what to say, but I am a stranger here. He was\nstill groping for a reply when a sharp knocking echoed in the hallway. “Are\nyou expecting anyone?”\n“Who would I be expecting? My entire acquaintance is here in the\nroom.”\nGlokta strained to listen as the front door opened, but could hear nothing\nmore than vague muttering. The door handle turned and the maid poked her\nhead into the room.\n“Begging your pardon, but there is a visitor for the Superior.”\n“Who?” snapped Glokta. Severard, with news of Prince Raynault’s\nguard? Vitari, with some message from the Arch Lector? Some new problem\nthat needs solving? Some new set of questions to ask?\n“He says his name is Mauthis.”\nGlokta felt the whole left side of his face twitching. Mauthis? He had\nnot thought about him for some time, but an image of the gaunt banker\nsprang instantly into his mind now, holding out the receipt, neatly and\nprecisely, for Glokta to sign. A receipt for a gift of one million marks. “It\nmay be that in the future, a representative of the banking house of Valint\nand Balk will come to you requesting… favours.”\nArdee was frowning over at him. “Something wrong?”\n“No, nothing,” he croaked, striving to keep his voice from sounding\nstrangled. “An old associate. Could you give me the room for a moment? I\nneed to talk with this gentleman.”\n“Of course.” She got up and started to walk to the door, her dress\nswishing on the carpet behind her. She paused halfway, looked over her\nshoulder, biting her lip. She went to the cabinet and opened it, pulled out\nthe bottle and the glass. She shrugged her shoulders. “I need something.”"

She shrugged her shoulders. “I need something.”\n“Don’t we all,” whispered Glokta at her back as she went out.\nMauthis stepped through the door a moment later. The same sharp bones\nin his face, the same cold eyes in deep sockets. There was something\nchanged in his demeanour, however. A certain nervousness. A certain\nanxiety, perhaps?\n“Why, Master Mauthis, what an almost unbearable honour it is to—”\n“You may dispense with the pleasantries, Superior.” His voice was shrill\nand grating as rusty hinges. “I have no ego to bruise. I prefer to speak\nplainly.”\n“Very well, what can I—”\n“My employers, the banking house of Valint and Balk, are not pleased\nwith your line of investigation.”\nGlokta’s mind raced. “My line of investigation into what?”\n“Into the murder of Crown Prince Raynault.”\n“That investigation is concluded. I assure you that I have no—”\n“Speaking plainly, Superior, they know. It would be easier for you to\nassume that they know everything. They usually will. The murder has been\nsolved, with impressive speed and competence, I may say. My employers\nare delighted with the results. The guilty man has been brought to justice.\nNo one will benefit from your delving any deeper into this unfortunate\nbusiness.”\nThat is speaking very plainly indeed. But why would Valint and Balk\nmind my questions? They gave me money to frustrate the Gurkish, now they\nseem to object to my investigating a Gurkish plot? It makes no sense…\nunless the killer did not come from the South at all. Unless Prince\nRaynault’s murderers are much closer to home…\n“There are some loose ends that need to be tied,” Glokta managed to\nmumble. “There is no need for your employers to be angry—”\nMauthis took a step forward. His forehead was glistening with sweat,\nthough the room was not hot. “They are not angry, Superior. You could not\nhave known that they would be displeased. Now you know. Were you to\ncontinue with this line of investigation, knowing that they are displeased…\nthen they would be angry.” He leaned down towards Glokta and almost\nwhispered. “Please allow me to tell you, Superior, as one piece on the board\nto another. We do not want them angry.” There was a strange note in his\nvoice. He does not threaten me. He pleads.\n“Are you implying,” Glokta murmured, scarcely moving his lips, “that\nthey would inform Arch Lector Sult of their little gift to the defence of\nDagoska?”\n“That is the very least of what they would do.” Mauthis’ expression was\nunmistakable. Fear. Fear, in that emotionless mask of a face. Something\nabout it left a certain bitterness on Glokta’s tongue, a certain coldness down\nhis back, a certain tightness in his throat. It was a feeling he remembered,\nfrom long ago. It was the closest he had come to being afraid, himself, in a\nlong time. They have me. Utterly and completely. I knew it when I signed.\nThat was the price, and I had no choice but to pay."

Good day.” And he\nturned and left Glokta alone in Ardee’s living room, staring at the door and\nwondering what had just happened.\nThe Abode of Stones\nT\nhe prow of the boat crunched hard into the rocky beach, and stones\ngroaned and scraped along the underside. Two of the oarsmen floundered\nout into the washing surf and dragged the boat a few steps further. Once it\nwas firmly grounded, they hurried back in as though the water caused\nintense pain. Jezal could not entirely blame them. The island at the edge of\nthe World, the ultimate destination of their journey, the place called\nShabulyan, had indeed a most forbidding appearance.\nA vast mound of stark and barren rock, the cold waves clutching at its\nsharp promontories and clawing at its bare beaches. Above rose jagged\ncliffs and slopes of treacherous scree, piled steeply upwards into a\nmenacing mountain, looming black against the dark sky.\n“Care to come ashore?” asked Bayaz of the sailors.\nThe four oarsmen showed no sign of moving, and their Captain slowly\nshook his head. “We have heard bad things of this island,” he grunted in\ncommon so heavily accented it was barely intelligible. “They say it is\ncursed. We will wait for you here.”\n“We may be some time.”\n“We will wait.”\nBayaz shrugged. “Wait, then.” He stepped from the boat and waded\nthrough knee-high breakers. Slowly and somewhat reluctantly the rest of\nthe party followed him through the icy sea and up onto the beach.\nIt was a bleak and blasted place, a place fit only for stones and cold\nwater. Waves foamed greedily up the shore and sucked jealously back out\nthrough the shingle. A pitiless wind cut across this wasteland and straight\nthrough Jezal’s wet trousers, whipping his hair in his eyes and chilling him\nto the marrow. It snatched away any trace of excitement he might have felt\nat reaching the end of their journey. It found chinks and holes in the\nboulders and made them sing, and sigh, and wail in a mournful choir.\nThere was precious little vegetation. Some colourless grass, ill with salt,\nsome thorny bushes more dead than alive. A few clumps of withered trees,\nhigher up away from the sea, clung desperately to the unyielding stone,\ncurved and bent over in the direction of the wind as though they might be\ntorn away at any moment. Jezal felt their pain.\n“A charming spot!” he shouted, his words flying off into the gale as soon\nas they left his lips. “If you are an enthusiast for rocks!”\n“Where does the wise man hide a stone?” Bayaz hurled back at him.\n“Among a thousand stones! Among a million!”\nThere certainly was no shortage of stones here. Boulders, rocks, pebbles,"

Boulders, rocks, pebbles,\nand gravel also were in abundant supply. It was the profound lack of\nanything else that rendered the place so singularly unpleasant. Jezal glanced\nback over his shoulder, feeling a sudden stab of panic at the notion of the\nfour oarsmen shoving the boat back out to sea and leaving them marooned.\nBut they were still where they had been, their skiff rocking gently near\nthe beach. Beyond them, on the churning ocean, Cawneil’s ill-made tub of a\nship sat at anchor, its sails lowered, its mast a black line against the troubled\nsky, moving slowly back and forth with the stirring of the uneasy waves.\nW\ne need to find somewhere out of the wind!” Logen bellowed.\n“Is there anywhere out of the wind in this bloody place?” Jezal shouted\nback.\n“There’ll have to be! We need a fire!”\nLongfoot pointed up towards the cliffs. “Perhaps up there we might find\na cave, or a sheltered spot. I will lead you!”\nThey clambered up the beach, first sliding in the shingle, then hopping\nfrom teetering rock to rock. The edge of the World hardly seemed worth all\nthe effort, as far as final destinations went. They could have found cold\nstone and cold water in plenty without ever leaving the North. Logen had a\nbad feeling about this barren place, but there was no point in saying so.\nHe’d had a bad feeling for the last ten years. Call on this spirit, find this\nSeed, and then away, and quickly. What then, though? Back to the North?\nBack to Bethod, and his sons, racks full of scores and rivers of bad blood?\nLogen winced. None of that held much appeal. Better to do it than to live in\nfear of it, his father would have said, but then his father said all kinds of\nthings, and a lot of them weren’t much use.\nHe looked over at Ferro, and she looked back. She didn’t frown, she\ndidn’t smile. He’d never been much at understanding women, of course, or\nanyone else, but Ferro was some new kind of riddle. She acted just as cold\nand angry by day as she ever had, but most nights now she still seemed to\nfind her way under his blanket. He didn’t understand it and he didn’t dare\nask. The sad fact was, she was about the best thing he’d had in his life for a\nlong time. He puffed his cheeks out and scratched his head. That didn’t say\nmuch for his life, now he thought about it.\nThey found a kind of cave at the base of the cliffs. More of a hollow\nreally, in the lee of two great boulders, where the wind didn’t blast quite so\nstrongly. Not much of a place for a conversation, but the island was a\nwasteland and Logen saw little chance of finding better.

Logen hunched over and fumbled the\ntinderbox out with numb fingers. Draughts blew in around the rocks, and\nthe wood was damp, but after much cursing and fumbling with the flint he\nfinally managed to light a fire fit for the purpose. They huddled in around it.\n“Bring out the box,” said Bayaz, and Logen hauled the heavy thing out\nfrom his pack and set it down next to Ferro with a grunt. Bayaz felt around\nits edge with his fingertips, found some hidden catch, and the lid lifted\nsilently. There were a set of metal coils underneath, pointing in from all\nsides to leave a space the size of Logen’s fist.\n“What are they for?” he asked.\n“To keep what is inside still and well cushioned.”\n“It needs to be cushioned?”\n“Kanedias thought so.” That answer did not make Logen feel any better.\n“Place it inside as soon as you are able,” said the Magus, turning to Ferro.\n“We do not wish to be exposed to it for longer than we must. It is best that\nyou all keep your distance.” And he ushered the others back with his palms.\nLuthar and Longfoot nearly scrambled over each other in their eagerness to\nget away, but Quai’s eyes were fixed on the preparations and he scarcely\nmoved.\nLogen sat cross-legged in front of the flickering fire, feeling the weight\nof worry in his stomach growing steadily heavier. He was starting to regret\never getting involved with this business, but it was a bit late now for second\nthoughts. “Something to offer them will help,” he said, looking round, and\nfound Bayaz already holding a metal flask out. Logen unscrewed the cap\nand took a sniff. The smell of strong spirits greeted his nostrils like a sorely\nmissed lover. “You had this all the time?”\nBayaz nodded. “For this very purpose.”\n“Wish I’d known. I could’ve put it to good use more than once.”\n“You can put it to good use now.”\n“Not quite the same thing.” Logen tipped the flask up and took a\nmouthful, resisted a powerful urge to swallow, puffed out his cheeks, and\nblew it out in a mist over the fire, sending up a gout of flame.\n“And now?” asked Bayaz.\n“Now we wait. We wait until—”\n“I am here, Ninefingers.” A voice like the wind through the rocks, like\nthe stones falling from the cliffs, like the sea draining through the gravel.\nThe spirit loomed over them in their shallow cave among the stones, a\nmoving pile of grey rock as tall as two men, casting no shadow.\nLogen raised his eyebrows. The spirits never answered promptly, if they\nbothered to answer at all. “That was quick.”\n“I have been waiting.”\n“A long time, I reckon.” The spirit nodded. “Well, er, we’ve come for\n—”\n“For that thing that the sons of Euz entrusted to me. There must be\ndesperate business in the world of men for you to seek it out.”\nLogen swallowed. “When isn’t there?”\n“Do you see anything?” Jezal whispered behind him."

I do not like his look.”\n“What does it say?” snapped Bayaz impatiently, staring into the air well\nto the left of the spirit.\nLogen scratched his face. “It says that Juvens was tall.”\n“Tall? What of it? Get what we came for and let us be gone!”\n“He is impatient,” rumbled the spirit.\n“We’ve come a long way. He has Juvens’ staff.”\nThe spirit nodded. “The dead branch is familiar to me. I am glad. I have\nheld this thing for long winters, and it has been a heavy weight to carry.\nNow I will sleep.”\n“Good idea. If you could—”\n“I will give it to the woman.”\nThe spirit dug its hand into its stony stomach and Logen shuffled back\nwarily. The fist emerged, and something was clutched inside, and he felt\nhimself shiver as he saw it.\n“Hold your hands out,” he muttered to Ferro.\nJ\nezal gave an involuntary gasp and scrambled away as the thing dropped\ndown into Ferro’s waiting palms, raising an arm to shield his face, his\nmouth hanging open with horror. Bayaz stared, eyes wide. Quai craned\neagerly forward. Logen grimaced and rocked back. Longfoot scrambled\nalmost all the way out of the hollow. For a long moment all six of them\nstared at the dark object in Ferro’s hands, no one moving, no one speaking,\nno sound except for the keening wind. There it was, before them. That thing\nwhich they had come so far, and braved so many dangers to find. That thing\nwhich Glustrod dug from the deep earth long years ago. That thing which\nhad made a blasted ruin of the greatest city in the world.\nThe Seed. The Other Side, made flesh. The very stuff of magic.\nThen Ferro slowly began to frown. “This is it?” she asked doubtfully.\n“This is the thing that will turn Shaffa to dust?”\nIt did, in fact, now that Jezal was overcoming the shock of its sudden\nappearance, look like nothing more than a stone. A chunk of unremarkable\ngrey rock the size of a big fist. No sense of unearthly danger washed from\nit. No deadly power was evident. No withering rays or stabs of lightning\nshot forth. It did, in fact, look like nothing more than a stone.\nBayaz blinked. He shuffled closer, on his hands and knees. He peered\ndown at the object in Ferro’s palms. He licked his lips, lifting his hand ever\nso slowly while Jezal watched, his heart pounding in his ears. Bayaz\ntouched the rock with his little fingertip, then jerked it instantly back. He\ndid not suddenly wither and expire. He probed it once more with his finger."

He probed it once more with his finger.\nThere was no thunderous detonation. He pressed his palm upon it. He\nclosed his thick fingers round it. He lifted it up. And still, it looked like\nnothing more than a stone.\nThe First of the Magi stared down at the thing in his hand, his eyes\ngrowing wider and wider. “This is not it,” he whispered, his lip trembling.\n“This is just a stone!”\nThere was a stunned silence. Jezal stared at Logen, and the Northman\ngazed back, scarred face slack with confusion. Jezal stared at Longfoot, and\nthe Navigator could only shrug his bony shoulders. Jezal stared at Ferro,\nand he watched her frown grow harder and harder. “Just a stone?” she\nmuttered.\n“Not it?” hissed Quai.\n“Then…” The meaning of Bayaz’s words was only just starting to sink\ninto Jezal’s mind. “I came all this way… for nothing?” A sudden gust blew\nup, snuffing out the miserable tongue of flame and blowing grit in his face.\n“Perhaps there is some mistake,” ventured Longfoot. “Perhaps there is\nanother spirit, perhaps there is another—”\n“No mistake,” said Logen, firmly shaking his head.\n“But…” Quai’s eyes were bulging from his ashen face. “But… how?”\nBayaz ignored him, muscles working on the side of his head. “Kanedias.\nHis hand is in this. He found some way to trick his brothers, and switch this\nlump of nothing for the Seed, and keep it for himself. Even in death, the\nMaker denies me!”\n“Just a stone?” growled Ferro.\n“I gave up my chance to fight for my country,” murmured Jezal,\nindignation starting to flicker up in his chest, “and I slogged hundreds of\nmiles across the wasteland, and I was beaten, and broken, and left scarred…\nfor nothing?”\n“The Seed.” Quai’s pale lips were curling back from his teeth, his breath\nsnorting fast through his nose. “Where is it? Where?”\n“If I knew that,” barked his master, “do you suppose we would be sitting\nhere on this forsaken island, bantering with spirits for a chunk of worthless\nrock?” And he lifted his arm and dashed the stone furiously onto the\nground. It cracked open and split into fragments, and they bounced, and\ntumbled, and clattered down among a hundred others, a thousand others, a\nmillion others the same.\n“It’s not here.” Logen shook his head sadly. “Say one thing for—”\n“Just a stone?” snarled Ferro, her eyes swivelling from the fallen chunks\nof rock to Bayaz’s face. “You fucking old liar!” She sprang up, fists\nclenched tight by her sides. “You promised me vengeance!”\nBayaz rounded on her, his face twisted with rage. “You think I have no\ngreater worries than your vengeance?” he roared, flecks of spit flying from\nhis lips and out into the rushing gale. “Or your disappointment?” he"

Brother\nLongfoot chose a poor moment to try and calm matters. “We should not be\ndownhearted, my comrades! The journey is its own reward—”\n“Say that once more, you shaven dolt!” hissed Bayaz. “Only once more,\nand I’ll make ashes of you!” The Navigator shrank trembling away, and the\nMagus snatched up his staff and stalked off, down from the hollow towards\nthe beach, his coat flailing around him in the bitter wind. So terrible had his\nfury been that, for a brief moment, the idea of staying on the island seemed\npreferable to getting back into a boat with him.\nIt was with that ill-tempered outburst, Jezal supposed, that their quest\nwas declared an utter failure.\n“Well then,” murmured Logen after they had all sat in the wind for a\nwhile longer. “I reckon that’s it.” He snapped the lid of the Maker’s empty\nbox shut. “No point crying about it. You have to be—”\n“Shut your fucking mouth, fool!” snarled Ferro at him. “Don’t tell me\nwhat I have to be!” And she strode out of the hollow and down towards the\nhissing sea.\nLogen winced as he pushed the box back into his pack, sighed as he\nswung it up onto his shoulder. “Realistic,” he muttered, then set off after\nher. Longfoot and Quai came next, all sullen anger and silent\ndisappointment. Jezal came up the rear, stepping from one jagged stone to\nanother, eyes nearly shut against the wind, turning the whole business over\nin his mind. The mood might have been deathly sombre, but as he picked\nhis way back towards the boat, he found to his surprise that he was almost\nunable to keep the smile from his face. After all, success or failure in this\nmad venture had never really meant anything to him. All that mattered was\nthat he was on his way home.\nT\nhe water slapped against the prow, throwing up cold white spray. The\nsailcloth bulged and snapped, the beams and the ropes creaked. The wind\nwhipped at Ferro’s face, but she narrowed her eyes and ignored it. Bayaz\nhad gone belowdecks in a fury and one by one the others had followed him\nout of the cold. Only she and Ninefingers stayed there, looking down at the\nsea.\n“What will you do now?” he asked her."

It was hard to feel the hatred as she had done. It no\nlonger seemed so important a matter if the Gurkish were left to their\nbusiness, and she to hers, but her doubts and her disappointment only made\nher bark it the more fiercely. “Nothing has changed. I still need vengeance.”\nSilence.\nShe glanced sideways, and she saw Ninefingers frowning down at the\npale foam on the dark water, as if her answer had not been the one he had\nbeen hoping for. It would have been easy to change it. “I’ll go where you\ngo,” she could have said, and who would have been worse off? No one.\nCertainly not her. But Ferro did not have it in her to put herself in his power\nlike that. Now it came to the test, there was an invisible wall between them.\nOne that there was no crossing.\nThere always had been.\nAll she could say was, “You?” He seemed to think about it a while,\nangry-looking, chewing at his lip. “I should go back to the North.” He said\nit unhappily, without even looking at her. “There’s work there I should\nnever have left. Dark work that needs doing. That’s where I’ll go, I reckon.\nBack to the North, and settle me some scores.”\nShe frowned. Scores? Who was it that told her you had to have more\nthan vengeance? Now scores was all he wanted? Lying bastard. “Scores,”\nshe hissed. “Good.”\nAnd the word was sour as sand on her tongue.\nHe looked her in the eye for a long moment. He opened his mouth as if\nhe was about to speak, and he stayed there, his lips formed into a word, one\nhand partway lifted towards her.\nThen he seemed suddenly to slump, and he set his jaw, and he turned his\nshoulder to her and leaned back on the rail. “Good.”\nAnd that easily it was all done between them.\nFerro scowled as she turned away. She curled up her fists and felt her\nnails digging into her palms, furious hard. She cursed to herself, and\nbitterly. Why could she not have said different words? Some breath, and a\nshape of the mouth, and everything is changed. It would have been easy.\nExcept that Ferro did not have it in her, and she knew she never would\nhave.

Always the way, after a battle. Only the ground wins.\nShivers and his Carls were just through the trees, heads bowed, burying\ntheir own. Twelve in the earth already, three more wounded bad enough\nthey’d most likely follow before the week was out, and another that’d lost\nhis hand—might live, might not, depending on his luck. Luck hadn’t been\ngood lately. Near half their number dead in one day’s work. Brave of ’em to\nstick after that. Dogman could hear their words. Sad words and proud, for\nthe fallen. How they’d been good men, how they’d fought well, how bad\nthey’d be missed and all the rest. Always the way, after a battle. Words for\nthe dead.\nDogman swallowed and looked back to the fresh-turned dirt at his feet.\nTough work digging in the cold, ground frozen hard. Still, you’re better off\ndigging than getting buried, Logen would’ve said, and the Dogman\nreckoned that was right enough. Two people he’d just finished burying, and\ntwo parts of himself along with ’em. Cathil deep down under the piled-up\ndirt, stretched out white and cold and would never be warm again.\nThreetrees not far from her, his broken shield across his knees and his\nsword in his fist. Two sets of hopes Dogman had put in the mud—some\nhopes for the future, and some hopes from the past. All done now, and\nwould never come to nothing, and they left an aching hole in him. Always\nthe way, after a battle. Hopes in the mud.\n“Buried where they died,” said Tul softly. “That’s fitting. That’s good.”\n“Good?” barked Dow, glaring over at West. “Good, is it? Safest place in\nthe whole battle? Safest place, did you tell ’em?” West swallowed and\nlooked down, guilty-seeming.\n“Alright, Dow,” said Tul. “You know better than to blame him for this,\nor anyone else. It’s a battle. Folk die. Threetrees knew that well enough,\nnone better.”\n“We could’ve been somewhere else,” growled Dow.\n“We could’ve been,” said Dogman, “but we weren’t, and there it is. No\nchanging it, is there? Threetrees is dead, and the girl’s dead, and that’s hard\nenough for everyone. Don’t need you adding to the burden.”\nDow’s fists bunched up and he took a deep breath in like he was about to\nshout something. Then he let it out, and his shoulders sagged, and his head\nfell. “You’re right. Nothing to be done, now.”\nDogman reached out and touched Pike on his arm. “You want to say\nsomething for her?” The burned man looked at him, then shook his head.\nHe wasn’t much for speaking, the Dogman reckoned, and he hardly blamed\nhim. Didn’t look like West was about to say nothing either, so Dogman\ncleared his throat, wincing at the pain across his ribs, and tried it himself.\nSomeone had to."

        "text": "him. Didn’t look like West was about to say nothing either, so Dogman\ncleared his throat, wincing at the pain across his ribs, and tried it himself.\nSomeone had to.\n“This girl we buried here, Cathil was her name. Can’t say I knew her too\nlong, or nothing, but what I knew I liked… for what that’s worth. Not much\nI reckon. Not much. But she had some bones to her, I guess we all saw that\non the way north. Took the cold and the hunger and the rest and never\ngrumbled. Wish I’d known her better. Hoped to, but, well, don’t often get\nwhat you hope for. She weren’t one of us, really, but she died with us, so I\nreckon we’re proud to have her in the ground with ours.”\n“Aye,” said Dow. “Proud to have her.”\n“That’s right,” said Tul. “Ground takes everyone the same.”\nDogman nodded, took a long, ragged breath and blew it out. “Anyone\nwant to speak for Threetrees?”\nDow flinched and looked down at his boots, shifting ’em in the dirt. Tul\nblinked up at the sky, looking like he had a bit of damp in his eye. Dogman\nhimself was only a stride away from weeping as it was. If he had to speak\nanother word, he knew he’d set to bawling like a child. Threetrees would\nhave known what to say, but there was the trouble, he was gone. Seemed\nlike no one had any words. Then Grim took a step forward.\n“Rudd Threetrees,” he said, looking round at ’em one by one. “Rock of\nUffrith, they called him. No bigger name in all the North. Great fighter.\nGreat leader. Great friend. Lifetime o’ battles. Stood face-to-face with the\nBloody-Nine, then shoulder to shoulder with him. Never took an easy path\nif he thought it was the wrong one. Never stepped back from a fight if he\nthought it had to be done. I stood with him, walked with him, fought with\nhim, ten years, all over the North.” His face broke out in a smile. “I’ve no\ncomplaints.”\n“Good words, Grim,” said Dow, looking down at the cold earth. “Good\nwords.”\n“There’ll be no more like Threetrees,” muttered Tul, wiping his eye like\nhe’d got something in it.\n“Aye,” said the Dogman. That was all he could manage.\nWest turned and trudged off through the trees, his shoulders hunched up,\nnot a word said. Dogman could see the muscles clenching in the side of his\nhead. Blaming himself, most likely. Men liked to do that a lot when folk\ndied, in the Dogman’s experience, and West seemed the type for it. Pike\nfollowed him, and the two of them passed Shivers coming up the other way.\nHe stopped beside the graves, frowning down, hair hanging round his\nface, then he looked up at them. “Don’t mean no disrespect. None at all. But\nwe need a new chief.”\n“The earth’s only just turned on him,” hissed Dow, giving him the eye.\nShivers held up his hands. “Best time to discuss it, then, I reckon. So"

So\nthere’s no confusion. My boys are jumpy, being honest. They’ve lost\nfriends, and they’ve lost Threetrees, and they need someone to look to,\nthat’s a fact. Who’s it going to be?”\nDogman rubbed his face. He hadn’t even thought about it yet, and now\nthat he did, he didn’t know what to think. Tul Duru Thunderhead and Black\nDow were two big, hard names, both led men before, and well. Dogman\nlooked at them, standing there, frowning at each other. “I don’t care which\no’ you it is,” he said. “I’ll follow either one. But it’s clear as clear, it has to\nbe one of you two.”\nTul glared down at Dow, and Dow glowered back up at him. “I can’t\nfollow him,” rumbled Tul, “and he won’t follow me.”\n“That’s a fact,” hissed Dow. “We talked it out already. Never work.”\nTul shook his head. “That’s why it can’t be either one of us.”\n“No,” said Dow. “It can’t be one of us.” He sucked at his teeth, snorted\nsome snot into his face, and spat it out onto the dirt. “That’s why it has to be\nyou, Dogman.”\n“That’s why what now?” said Dogman, his eyes wide open and staring.\nTul nodded. “You’re the chief. We’ve all agreed it.”\n“Uh,” said Grim, not even looking up.\n“Ninefingers gone,” said Dow, “and Threetrees gone, and that leaves\nyou.”\nDogman winced. He was waiting for Shivers to say, “You what? Him?\nChief?” He was waiting for them all to start laughing, and tell him it was a\njoke. Black Dow, and Tul Duru Thunderhead, and Harding Grim, not to\nmention two dozen Carls besides, all taking his say-so. Stupidest idea he\never heard. But Shivers didn’t laugh.\n“That’s a good choice, I reckon. Speaking for my lads, that’s what I was\ngoing to suggest. I’ll let ’em know.” And he turned and made off through\nthe trees, with the Dogman gawping after him.\n“But what about them others?” he hissed once Shivers was well out of\nhearing, wincing at a stab of pain in his ribs. “There’s twenty fucking Carls\ndown there, and jumpy! They need a name to follow!”\n“You got the name,” said Tul. “You came across the mountains with\nNinefingers, fought all those years with Bethod. There ain’t no bigger\nnames than yours left standing. You seen more battles than any of us.”\n“Seen ’em, maybe—”\n“You’re the one,” said Dow, “and that’s all. So you ain’t the hardest\nkiller since Skarling, so what? Your hands are bloody enough for me to\nfollow, and there’s no better scout alive. You know how to lead. You’ve\nseen the best at it.

You’re the chief now, and we’ll stand\nbehind you. Any man don’t care to do as you tell ’em can speak to us.”\n“And that’ll be one short-arsed conversation,” growled Dow.\n“You’re the chief.” Tul turned and strode off through the trees.\n“It’s decided.” And Black Dow followed him.\n“Uh,” said Grim, shrugging his shoulders and making off with the other\ntwo.\n“But,” muttered the Dogman. “Hold on…”\nThey’d gone. So he guessed that made him chief.\nHe stood there for a moment, blinking, not knowing what to think. He\nwas never leader before. He didn’t feel no different. He didn’t have any\nideas, all of a sudden. No notions of what to tell men to do. He felt like an\nidiot. Even more of one than usual.\nHe knelt down, between the graves, and he stuck his hand in the soil,\nand he felt it cold and wet around his fingers. “Sorry, girl,” he muttered.\n“Didn’t deserve this.” He gripped the ground tight, and he squeezed it in his\npalm. “Fare you well, Threetrees. I’ll try and do what you’d have done.\nBack to the mud, old man.”\nAnd he stood up, and he wiped his hand on his shirt, and he walked\naway, back to the living, and left the two of them behind him in the earth.\nAcknowledgments\nFour people without whom…\nBren Abercrombie, whose eyes are sore from reading it\nNick Abercrombie, whose ears are sore from hearing about it\nRob Abercrombie, whose fingers are sore from turning the pages\nLou Abercrombie, whose arms are sore from holding me up\nAlso…\nJon Weir, for putting the word out\nSimon Spanton, for not putting the boot in\nAnd who could forget…\nGillian Redfearn, who not only made it happen, but made it better\nextras\nmeet the author\nPhoto Credit: Lou Abercrombie\nJOE ABERCROMBIE is the New York Times bestselling author of the First Law\nseries and the Shattered Sea trilogy.

He stretched his twisted neck\nout to one side and then to the other, hearing the familiar clicks, feeling the\nfamiliar cords of pain stretching out through the tangled muscles between\nhis shoulder blades. Why do I do it, when it always hurts me? Why must we\ntest the pain? Tongue the ulcer, rub the blister, pick the scab?\n“Well?” he snapped.\nThe marble bust at the foot of the stairs offered only its silent contempt.\nAnd I get more than enough of that already. Glokta shuffled away, his\nuseless foot scraping over the tiles behind him, the tapping of his cane\nechoing amongst the mouldings on the faraway ceiling.\nWhen it came to the great noblemen on the Open Council, Lord\nIngelstad, the owner of this oversized hall, was an undersized man indeed.\nThe head of a family whose fortunes had declined with the passing years,\nwhose wealth and influence had shrivelled to almost nothing. And the more\nshrivelled the man, the more swollen his pretensions must become. Why do\nthey never realise? Small things only seem smaller in large spaces.\nSomewhere in the shadows a clock vomited up a few sluggish chimes.\nGood and late already. The more shrivelled the man, the longer the wait on\nhis pleasure. But I can be patient, when I must. I have no dazzling banquets,\nno ecstatic crowds, no beautiful women waiting breathlessly for my arrival,\nafter all. Not any more. The Gurkish saw to that, in the darkness beneath\nthe Emperor’s prisons. He pressed his tongue into his empty gums and\ngrunted as he shifted his leg, needles from it shooting up his back and\nmaking his eyelid flicker. I can be patient. The one good thing about every\nstep being an ordeal. You soon learn how to tread carefully.\nThe door beside him opened sharply and Glokta snapped his head round,\ndoing his best to hide a grimace as his neck bones crunched. Lord Ingelstad\nstood in the doorway: a big, fatherly man with a ruddy complexion. He\noffered up a friendly smile as he beckoned Glokta into the room. Quite as\nthough this were a social call, and a welcome one at that.\n“I must apologise for keeping you waiting, Superior. I have had so many\nvisitors since I arrived in Adua, my head is in quite a spin!” Let us hope it\ndoesn’t spin right off. “So very many visitors!” Visitors with offers, no\ndoubt. Offers for your vote. Offers for your help in choosing our next king.\nBut my offer, I think, you will find painful to refuse. “Will you take wine,\nSuperior?”\n“No, my Lord, thank you.” Glokta hobbled over the threshold. “I will\nnot stay long. I, too, have a great deal of business to attend to.” Elections\ndon’t rig themselves, you know.\n“Of course, of course. Please be seated.” Ingelstad dropped happily into\none of his chairs and gestured to another. It took Glokta a moment to get\nsettled, lowering himself carefully, then shifting his hips until he discovered\na position in which his back did not give him constant pain. “And what did\nyou wish to discuss with me?”"

I hope you will not be\noffended if I am blunt, but his Eminence wants your vote.”\nThe nobleman’s heavy features twisted in feigned puzzlement. Very\nbadly feigned, as it goes. “I am not sure that I understand. My vote on what\nissue?”\nGlokta wiped some wet from beneath his leaking eye. Must we engage\nin such undignified dancing? You have not the build for it, and I have not\nthe legs. “On the issue of who will next occupy the throne, Lord Ingelstad.”\n“Ah. That.” Yes, that. Idiot. “Superior Glokta, I hope I will not\ndisappoint you, or his Eminence, a man for whom I have nothing but the\nhighest respect,” and he bowed his head with an exaggerated show of\nhumility, “when I say that I could not, in all good conscience, allow myself\nto be influenced in any one direction. I feel that I, and all the members of\nthe Open Council, have been given a sacred trust. I am duty bound to vote\nfor the man who seems to me to be the very finest candidate, from the many\nexcellent men available.” And he assumed a grin of the greatest self-\nsatisfaction.\nA fine speech. A village dunce might have even believed it. How often\nhave I heard it, or its like, the past few weeks? Traditionally, the bargaining\nwould come next. The discussion of how much, exactly, a sacred trust is\nworth. How much silver outweighs a good conscience. How much gold cuts\nthrough the bindings of duty. But I am not in a bargaining mood today.\nGlokta raised his eyebrows very high. “I must congratulate you on a\nnoble stand, Lord Ingelstad. If everyone had your character we would be\nliving in a better world. A noble stand indeed… especially when you have\nso much to lose. No less than everything, I suppose.” He winced as he took\nhis cane in one hand and rocked himself painfully forward towards the edge\nof the chair. “But I see you will not be swayed, and so I take my leave—”\n“What can you refer to, Superior?” The nobleman’s unease was written\nplainly across his plump face.\n“Why, Lord Ingelstad, to your corrupt business dealings.”\nThe ruddy cheeks had lost much of their glow. “There must be some\nmistake.”\n“Oh no, I assure you.” Glokta slid the papers of confession from the\ninside pocket of his coat. “You are mentioned often in the confessions of\nsenior Mercers, you see? Very often.” And he held the crackling pages out\nso they both could see them. “Here you are referred to as—and not my\nchoice of words, you understand—an ‘accomplice.’ Here as the ‘prime\nbeneficiary’ of a most unsavoury smuggling operation. And here, you will\nnote—and I almost blush to mention it—your name and the word ‘treason’\nappear in close proximity.”\nIngelstad sagged back into his chair and set his glass rattling down on"

Oh, we really should wipe that up. It could leave an awful stain, and\nsome stains are impossible to remove.\n“His Eminence,” continued Glokta, “counting you as a friend, was able\nto keep your name out of the initial enquiries, for everybody’s sake. He\nunderstands that you were merely trying to reverse the failing fortunes of\nyour family, and is not without sympathy. If you were to disappoint him in\nthis business of votes, however, his sympathy would be quickly exhausted.\nDo you take my meaning?” I feel that I have made it abundantly clear.\n“I do,” croaked Ingelstad.\n“And the bonds of duty? Do they feel any looser, now?”\nThe nobleman swallowed, the flush quite vanished from his face. “I am\neager to assist his Eminence in any way possible, of course, but… the thing\nis—” What now? A desperate offer? A despairing bribe? An appeal to my\nconscience, even? “A representative of High Justice Marovia came to me\nyesterday. A man called Harlen Morrow. He made very similar\nrepresentations… and not dissimilar threats.” Glokta frowned. Did he now?\nMarovia, and his little worm. Always just one step ahead, or just one step\nbehind. But never far away. A shrill note crept into Ingelstad’s voice. “What\nam I to do? I cannot support you both! I will leave Adua, Superior, and\nnever return! I will… I will abstain from voting—”\n“You’ll do no such fucking thing!” hissed Glokta. “You’ll vote the way I\ntell you and Marovia be damned!” More prodding? Distasteful, but so be it.\nAre my hands not filthy to the elbow? Rummaging through another sewer or\ntwo will scarcely make the difference. He let his voice soften to an oily purr.\n“I observed your daughters in the park yesterday.” The nobleman’s face lost\nits last vestige of colour. “Three young innocents on the very cusp of\nwomanhood, dressed all in the height of fashion, and each one lovelier than\nthe last. The youngest would be… fifteen?”\n“Thirteen,” croaked Ingelstad.\n“Ah.” And Glokta let his lips curl back to display his toothless smile.\n“She blooms early. They have never before visited Adua, am I correct?”\n“They have not,” he nearly whispered.\n“I thought not. Their excitement and delight as they toured the gardens\nof the Agriont were perfectly charming. I swear, they must have caught the\neye of every eligible suitor in the capital.” He allowed his smile slowly to\nfade. “It would break my heart, Lord Ingelstad, to see three such delicate\ncreatures snatched suddenly away to one of Angland’s harshest penal\ninstitutions. Places where beauty, and breeding, and a gentle disposition\nattract an entirely different and far less enjoyable kind of attention.” Glokta\ngave a carefully orchestrated shudder of dismay as he leaned slowly"

Places where beauty, and breeding, and a gentle disposition\nattract an entirely different and far less enjoyable kind of attention.” Glokta\ngave a carefully orchestrated shudder of dismay as he leaned slowly\nforward to whisper. “I would not wish that life on a dog. And all on account\nof the indiscretions of a father who had the means of reparation well within\nhis grasp.”\n“But my daughters, they were not involved—”\n“We are electing a new king! Everyone is involved!” Harsh, perhaps.\nBut harsh times demand harsh actions. Glokta struggled to his feet, hand\nwobbling on his cane with the effort. “I will tell his Eminence that he can\ncount on your vote.”\nIngelstad collapsed, suddenly and completely. Like a stabbed wineskin.\nHis shoulders sagged, his face hung loose with horror and hopelessness.\n“But the High Justice…” he whispered. “Have you no pity?”\nGlokta could only shrug. “I did have. As a boy I was soft-hearted\nbeyond the point of foolishness. I swear, I would cry at a fly caught in a\nspider’s web.” He grimaced at a brutal spasm through his leg as he turned\nfor the door. “Constant pain has cured me of that.”\nIt was an intimate little gathering. But the company hardly inspires warmth.\nSuperior Goyle glared at Glokta from across the huge, round table in the\nhuge, round office, his beady eyes staring from his bony face. And not with\ntender feelings, I rather think.\nThe attention of his Eminence the Arch Lector, the head of His\nMajesty’s Inquisition, was fixed elsewhere. Pinned to the curving wall,\ntaking up perhaps half of the entire chamber, were three hundred and twenty\nsheets of paper. One for every great heart on our noble Open Council. They\ncrackled gently in the breeze from the great windows. Fluttering little\npapers for fluttering little votes. Each one was marked with a name. Lord\nthis, Lord that, Lord someone of wherever. Big men and little men. Men\nwhose opinions, on the whole, no one cared a damn for until Prince\nRaynault fell out of his bed and into his grave.\nMany of the pages had a blob of coloured wax on their corner. Some had\ntwo, or even three. Allegiances. Which way will they vote? Blue for Lord\nBrock, red for Lord Isher, black for Marovia, white for Sult, and so on. All\nsubject to change, of course, depending which way the wind blows them.\nBelow were written lines of small, dense script. Too small for Glokta to\nread from where he was sitting, but he knew what they said. Wife was once\na whore. Partial to young men. Drinks too much for his good. Murdered a\nservant in a rage. Gambling debts he cannot cover. Secrets. Rumours. Lies.\nThe tools of this noble trade. Three hundred and twenty names, and just as\nmany sordid little stories, each one to be picked at, and dug out, and jabbed\nour way. Politics. Truly, the work of the righteous.\nSo why do I do this? Why?\nThe Arch Lector had more pressing concerns. “Brock still leads,” he\nmurmured in a dour drone, staring at the shifting papers with his white"

Why?\nThe Arch Lector had more pressing concerns. “Brock still leads,” he\nmurmured in a dour drone, staring at the shifting papers with his white\ngloved hands clasped behind his back. “He has some fifty votes, more or\nless certain.” As certain as we can be in these uncertain times. “Isher is not\nfar behind, with forty or more to his name. Skald has made some recent\ngains, as far as we can tell. An unexpectedly ruthless man. He has the\nStarikland delegation more or less in his hand, which gives him thirty votes,\nperhaps, and Barezin about the same. They are the four main contenders, as\nthings stand.”\nBut who knows? Perhaps the king will live another year, and by the time\nit comes to a vote we’ll all have killed each other. Glokta had to stifle a grin\nat the thought. The Lords’ Round heaped with richly dressed corpses, every\ngreat nobleman in the Union and all twelve members of the Closed Council.\nEach stabbed in the back by the man beside. The ugly truth of\ngovernment…\n“Did you speak to Heugen?” snapped Sult.\nGoyle tossed his balding head and sneered at Glokta with seething\nannoyance. “Lord Heugen is still struggling under the delusion that he\ncould be our next king, though he cannot certainly control more than a\ndozen chairs. He barely had time to hear our offer he was so busy\nscrabbling to coax out more votes. Perhaps in a week, or two, he will see\nreason. Then he might be encouraged to lean our way, but I wouldn’t bet on\nit. More likely he’ll throw in his lot with Isher. The two of them have\nalways been close, I understand.”\n“Good for them,” hissed Sult. “What about Ingelstad?”\nGlokta stirred in his seat. “I presented him with your ultimatum in very\nblunt terms, your Eminence.”\n“Then we can count on his vote?”\nHow to put this? “I could not say so with absolute certainty. High Justice\nMarovia was able to make threats almost identical to our own, through his\nman Harlen Morrow.”\n“Morrow? Isn’t he some lickspittle of Hoff’s?”\n“It would seem he has moved up in the world.” Or down, depending on\nhow you look at it.\n“He could be taken care of.” Goyle wore a most unsavoury expression.\n“Quite easily—”\n“No!” snapped Sult. “Why is it, Goyle, that no sooner does a problem\nappear than you want to kill it! We must tread carefully for now, and show\nourselves to be reasonable men, open to negotiation.” He strode to the\nwindow, the bright sunlight glittering purple through the great stone on his\nring of office. “Meanwhile the business of actually running the country is\nignored. Taxes go uncollected. Crimes go unpunished. This bastard they call\nthe Tanner, this demagogue, this traitor, speaks in public at village fairs,\nurging open rebellion!

I would not put it past them!”\n“Will the army return from the North soon?” asked Goyle.\n“Unlikely.

The six crumbling spires of the University dominated\nthe view. But what help could anyone possibly find there?

Glokta, arrange an\ninterview with Lord Wetterlant. He has yet to declare himself one way or\nthe other.

It went badly for\nus and I took an arrow, the poison from which will shortly kill me.\nI woke up sodden with dew and rain like the boys, soaked all over from\nthe trees above us, but my mouth was dusty like sand. Rivers couldn’t wet\nit. The compound I use to ease my bones leeches my spit. I speak soft.\nI could hardly crack a whistle at the boys wrapped like a nest of slugs in\ntheir oilskins against the winds of the plains these woods were edged\nagainst. I’m old. I just kicked them up before getting my bow out of the\nsack I put it in to keep rain off the string. It was a beauty what I called\nJuletta and I had her for most of my life.\nThe boys were slow to get going, blowing and fussing as the freezing air\ngot to work in that bit of dawn. They were quiet, and grim like ghosts in this\nlight, pairing up to strap their leathers and get the swords pasted with\npoison.\nI patted heads and squeezed shoulders and gave words as I moved\nthrough the crew so they knew I was about and watching.\n“Paste it thick,” I said as they put on the mittens and rubbed their blades\nwith the soaked rags from the pot Remy had opened.\nI looked around the boys I shared skins and pipes with under the moon\nthose last few weeks. Good crew.\nThere was Remy, looking up at me from his mixing, face all scarred like\na milky walnut and speaking lispy from razor fights and rackets he ran with\nbefore joining up for a pardon. He had a poison of his own he made, less\nrefined than my own mix, less quick, more agony.\nYasthin was crouched next to him. He was still having to shake the\ncramp off his leg that took a mace a month before. Saved his money for his\nbrother, told me he was investing it. The boys said his brother gambled it\nand laughed him up.\nDolly was next to Yasthin, chewing some bacon rinds. Told me how her\nda chased her soak of a mother through the streets, had done since she was\nyoung. Kids followed her da too, singing with him but staying clear of his\nknives. She joined so’s she could help her da keep her younger brother.\nAll of them got sorrows that led them to the likes of me and a fat purse\nfor a crossroads job, which I mean to say is a do-or-die.\nSoon enough they’re lined up and waiting for the Honour, Kailen’s\nHonour, the best fightbrew Kigan ever mixed, so, the best fightbrew ever\nmixed, even all these years later. The boys had been talking up this brew\nsince I took command, makes you feel like you could punch holes in\nmountains when you’ve risen on it.\nYasthin was first in line for a measure. I had to stand on my toes to pour\nit in, lots of the boys taller than me. Then a kiss. The lips are the raw end of\nyour terror and love. No steel can toughen lips, they betray more than the\neyes when you’re looking for intent and the kiss is for telling them there’s\nalways some way to die."

I took\na slug myself and Rirgwil fixed my leathers. I waited for our teeth to chatter\nlike aristos, then went over the plan again.\n“In the trees north, beyond those fields, is Trukhar’s supply caravan,” I\nsaid. “Find it, kill who you can, but burn the wagons, supplies, and then go\nfor the craftsmen. Shale’s leadin’ his crew in from east an’ we got them\npincered when we meet, red bands left arm so as you know.

Remy’s boys split from us and moved away.\nSlow, I signed.\nJuletta was warm in my hands, the arrow in my fingers humming to fly.\nThen, the brew fierce in my eyes, I saw it, the red glow of a pipe some\nseventy yards ahead at the treeline.\nTwo men. On mark.\nI moved forward to take the shot and stepped into a nest of eggs. The\nbird, a big grey Weger, screeched at me and flapped madly into the air\ninches from my face, its cry filling the sky.

It was shooting practice for Trukhar’s soldiers.\nI never saw Henny or Jonah again, just heard some laughing and\nscreaming and the sound of blades at work before it died off.\nI stayed put, watching for the enemy’s movements. I was in the outroots\nof a tree, unspotted. You feel eyes on you with this brew. Then I saw two\nscouts moving right, following Booey and Datschke’s run.\nI took a sporebag and popped it on the end of an arrow. I stood up and\nsent it at the ground ahead of them.\nFrom my belt I got me some white oak sap which I took for my eyes to\nsee safe in the spore cloud. I put on a mask covered with the same stuff for\nbreathing.\nThe spores were quick to get in them and they wheezed and clutched\ntheir throats as I finished them off.\nI was hoping I could have saved my boys but I needed to be in some\nguts and get the job done with Shale’s crew.\nHorns were going up now, so the fighting was on. I saw a few coming at\nme from the trees ahead. I got behind a trunk but I knew I was spotted.\nThey slowed up and the hemp creaked as they drew for shots. There were\nfour of them, from their breathing, and I could hear their commander\nwhispering for a flanking.\nI opened up a satchel of rice paper bags, each with quicklime and oiled\nfeathers. I needed smoke. I doused a few bags with my flask and threw\nthem out.\n“Masks!” came the shout. As the paper soaked, the lime caught and the\nfeathers put out a fierce smoke.\nMy eyes were still smeared good. I took a couple more arrowbags out,\nbut these were agave powders for blistering the eyes and skin.\nTwo shots to tree trunks spread the powders in the air around their\nposition and I moved out from the tree to them as they screeched and\nstaggered about blind. The Honour give me the senses enough to read\nwhere they were without my eyes, better to shut them with smoke and\npowders in the air, and their brews weren’t the Honour’s equal. They moved\nlike they were running through honey and were easy to pick off.\nIt was then I took the arrow that’ll do for me. I’d got maybe fifty yards\nfurther on when I heard the bow draw, but with the noise ahead I couldn’t\nplace it that fraction quicker to save myself. The arrow went in at my hip,\ninto my guts. Some things give in there, and the poison’s gone right in,\nblack mustard oil for sure from the vapours burning in my nose, probably\nsome of their venom too.\nI was on my knees trying to grab the arrow when I saw them approach,\ntwo of them. The one who killed me was dropping his bow and they both\nclosed with the hate of their own fightbrew, their eyes crimson, skin an\nangry red and all the noisies.\nThey think I’m done.

One’s a heavy\nin his mail coat and broadsword, a boy’s weapon in a forest, too big. Older\none had leathers and a long knife. Him first. My sight was going, the world\ngoing flat like a drawing, so I had to get rid of the wiser one while I could\nstill see him, while I still had the Honour’s edge.\nKnife in hand I lunged sudden, the leap bigger than they reckoned. The\nolder one reacted, a sidestep. The slash I made wasn’t for hitting him\nthough. It flicked out a spray of paste from the blade and sure enough some\nbit of it caught him in the face. I spun about, brought my blade up and\nparried the boy’s desperate swing as he closed behind me, the blow forcing\nme down again as it hit my knife, sending a smack through my guts as the\narrow broke in me. He took sight of his mate holding his smoking face,\nscratching at his cheeks and bleeding. He glanced at the brown treacle\nrunning over my blade and legged it. He had the spunk to know he was\nbeaten. I put the knife in the old man’s throat to quiet my noisies, the\nblood’s smell as sweet as fresh bread to me.\nI picked up my Juletta and moved on. The trees were filling with\nBlackhands now. I didn’t have the time to be taking off my wamba and\nsorting myself out a cure for the arrow, much less tugging at it now it was\ninto me. I cussed at myself, for this was likely where I was going to die if I\ndidn’t get something to fix me. I was slowing up. I took a hit of the Honour\nto keep me fresh. It was going to make a fierce claim on the other side, but I\nwould gladly take that if I could get some treatment.\nFinally I reached the caravan; smoke from the blazing wagons and stores\nfilled the trees ahead. The grain carts were burning, so Shale, again,\ndelivered the purse.\nThen I come across Dolly, slumped against the roots of a tree. Two\narrows were thrusting proud from her belly. She saw me and her eyes\nwidened and she smiled.\n“Gant, you’re not done… Oh,” she said, seeing the arrow in me. I might\nhave been swaying, she certainly didn’t look right, faded somewhat, like\nshe was becoming a ghost before me.\n“Have you a flask Gant, some more of the Honour?”\nHer hands were full of earth, grabbing at it, having their final fling.\n“I’m out Dolly,” I said, “I’m done too. I’m sorry for how it all ended.”\nShe blinked, grief pinching her up.\n“It can’t be over already. I’m twenty summers, Gant. This was goin’ to\nbe the big purse.”\nA moment then I couldn’t fill with any words.\n“Tell my father, Gant, say…”"

I did my best to clean an arrow on my leggings.\nShe was watching me as I did it, knowing.\n“Tell him I love him, Gant, tell him I got the Honour, and give him my\npurse and my brother a kiss.”\n“I will.”\nAs I drew it she looked above me, seeing something I knew I wouldn’t\nsee, leagues away, some answers to her questions in her eyes thrilling her. I\nlet fly, fell to my knees and sicked up.\nWhere was Shale?\nMy mouth was too dry to speak or shout for him, but I needed him. My\neyes, the lids of them, were peeling back so’s they would burn in the sun. I\nput my hands to my face. It was only visions, but my chest was heavy, like\nsomebody sat on it and others were piling on. Looking through my hands as\nI held them up, it was like there were just bones there, flesh thin like the fins\nof a fish. My breathing rattled and I reached to my throat to try to open it up\nmore.\n“Gant!”\nSo much blood on him. He kneeled next to me. He’s got grey eyes, no\ncolour. Enemy to him is just so much warm meat to be put still. He don’t\nmuch smile unless he’s drunk. He mostly never drinks. He sniffed about me\nand at my wound, to get a reading of what was in it, then forced the arrow\nout with a knife and filled the hole with guaia bark while kneeling on my\nshoulder to keep me still. He was barking at some boys as he stuffed some\nrugara leaves, sap and all, into my mouth, holding my nose shut, drowning\nme. Fuck! My brains were buzzing sore like a hive was in them. Some\nfrothing liquid filled up my chest and I was bucking about for breath. He\npoured from a flask over my hip and the skin frosted over with an agony of\nburning. Then he took out some jumpcrick’s legbones and held them against\nthe hole, snap snap, a flash of blue flame and everything fell away high.\nThere was a choking, but it didn’t feel like me no longer. It felt like the\nman I was before I died.\nKAILEN\n“Let’s see it.”\nAchi flicked it across the table, a pebble across wood, but this stone was\nworked with precision, as round as a coin, black and thick as a thumb.\nThere were no markings on it, a hairline of quartz the only imperfection of\nthe material itself. The ocean had polished it, my face made a shadow by it.\nIt was the third I’d seen in the last few months.\n“The Prince, from your old crew, his throat was cut,” said Achi.\nAchi drained his cup, leaned back in his chair and yawned, the chair\ncreaking, not built for such a big man still in his leathers, filthy and sour-\nsmelling from the weeks sleeping out.\n“How are the boys?” I asked.\nHe opened his eyes with a start, already drifting away to sleep. I smiled\nat his irritation."

Let him\nknow if you see him before me.”\nAchi nodded and yawned again.\nI looked again at the black coin in my fingers. Such coins were given to\nmercenaries who betrayed their purse or their crew. But who had The Prince\nbetrayed?\nWe called him The Prince because there was a time when he was in line\nfor a throne, last of three, least loved and cleverest. His homeland chose its\nemperors in a way as ridiculous as any; which of the incumbents best\ndemonstrated martial prowess. His sister won their single combat on the\nday their father died and was thus made queen, but his sword wasn’t what\nmade him worthy of the Twenty.\nThe Prince did the politics his sister could not. War allows only two\ndimensions, yours and theirs, a limit his sister was not capable of seeing\nbeyond. Nations require the management of more factions than cut\ndiamonds have facets and I met nobody that could exploit his empire’s\npolitic more adroitly than The Prince.\nI plucked a white grape from the bowl, milky and juicy as a blind\neyeball. Achi peeled eggs, head bowed. The bargirl came in and cleared\naway the plates. She offered a quick smile before retreating to the noise of\nthe inn below us.\nI recalled the two other black coins I’d seen recently, as perfect as this\none, which The Prince showed me in his cabin aboard one of the Quartet’s\ngrand galleys only a few months ago. The Quartet were an influential\nmerchant guild across most of the Old Kingdoms.\nI had travelled to see him after he’d sent an escort to get me.\n“These coins were found with Harlain and Milu,” he said, “I will try and\nfind out more.”\n“How did they die?” I asked.\n“Harlain returned to his homeland, Tetswana, became their leader, the\nKaan of Tetswana no less. It was the gathering before the rains. Leaders and\nretinues of nine tribes. Seventy or so dead, the coin in his hand only.”\nHarlain would not join us at Snakewood, the last time any of the Twenty\nwere together. He had wanted to leave us some time before the end. Paying\nthe colour had taken from all of us, but it took his heart. It was only as we\nembraced for a final time and I helped him with his saddle that I realized I\nhadn’t heard him singing for some months. I was glad he made it home.\n“Milu?” I asked.\n“He became a horse singer out in Alagar. They found him lying at the\nside of a singer’s pit. Someone had been with him, footprints in the sand\naround his body, the coin in his hand.”\n“Poison?” I asked.\n“Almost certainly. No way of placing it.”"

No way of placing it.”\nMilu had also been at Snakewood, but stayed only for a drink and to buy\nsupplies before leaving with Kheld. They had lost heart as much as Harlain\nhad; no talk of purses or where in the world was at war; they did not\ndiscuss, as did Sho or Shale, how my name could be put to work to bolster\nthe gold of a purse.\nI never tired of watching Milu work, bringing the wild horses to his side,\ntraining them to hold firm in the charge. It seemed that he, like Harlain, had\nbeen able to let go of the mercenary life before the colour took everything.\n“Their deaths are connected, Kailen. It must be the Twenty.”\n“You’ve heard from nobody else?”\n“Only that Dithnir had died. He went back home to Tarantrea, one of\ntheir envoys that negotiates with the Quartet I represent knows me well and\nshared the news with me. I asked about a coin but there was none. Apart\nfrom that I keep in touch with Kheld when I’m in Handar, but the rest, no\nidea.”\nI breathed deeply of the morning breeze that blew across the deck and\nslapped at the fringes of the awning we were beneath. Dithnir was a\nbowman, almost a match for Stixie, shy and inadvisedly romantic with\nwhores, cold and implacable in the field.\n“I remember Snakewood,” said The Prince.\nOur eyes met briefly. “No. That was dealt with.” I’d said it more sharply\nthan I’d intended. Why did I feel a thread of doubt?\nHe reached across the table, took the carafe and refilled our glasses.\n“Your estate is improving,” he said, holding up his glass for a toast.\n“Yes, these vines were planted two winters ago, they’ll improve. I only\nwish for Jua’s cooler summers, perhaps an estate nearer the hills. How is the\nQuartet? I hear you have brokered a treaty with the Shalec to cross their\nwaters. Not even the Post could manage it.”\n“Why would I toil through its ranks to High Reeve or Fieldsman when I\ncan be a Partner with the Quartet. The Red himself could learn something\nfrom The Quartet regarding our softening of the Shalec, but I’m glad he\nhasn’t, I’m lining my pockets beautifully. Remarkable as the Post runs so\nmuch trade elsewhere. They can bid lower than us at almost every turn; we\ncan’t match the subs, but we can work with lower margins, give Shalec a\nfee on the nutmeg, a pittance of course. Every investor north of the Gulf\nbelieves the Post controls the winds.”\n“While the Post can sub dividends over fewer summers than anyone\nelse, the flatbacks will flock,” I said, “but enough of trade, congratulations\nPrince, I’m glad to see things are going well, being a Partner suits you.

He had been the difference at Ahmstad, turning three\nprominent families under the noses of Vilmor’s king, extending the borders\nand fortifying them in a stroke. The mad king is still being strangled in the\nnoose The Prince tied. His death proved that whoever of us was alive was in\ndanger. I signed our purses. This could only be about getting at me.\nAchi had fallen asleep.\nI poured him some of the dreadful brandy that was the best the Riddle\nhad to offer.\nShale and Gant were taking a purse only weeks south. If they were still\nanything like the soldiers of old I would have need of them. Achi’s crew\nwould be glad to be going back to Harudan. I needed good men with my\nwife, Araliah. Still, there was one more thing I needed to ask of Achi\nhimself, one person I needed to confirm was dead.\nTHE PRINCE AND THE AHMSTAD\nAn account, by a Fieldsman in the guise of a bodyguard to the\nAhmstad Ladus (chief), of the negotiation by which Kailen and The\nPrince secured a bloodless victory for Ahmstad over Vilmor.\n—Goran\nReport: Candar Prime, Q4 649 OE\nEastern Sar Westmain routed\nConfidential for The Red only\nFieldsman 71\nYou are aware of Vilmorian expansionism under their King Turis. They\nhave been amassing an army for assaults on two fronts, the Luzhan\nProvince and Ahmstad.\nA clan leader for Ahmstad brought a mercenary known as Kailen to their\nwar council. To say the Ladus was displeased was to put it mildly. The clan\nleader, Hasike, asked that the Ladus hear him out.\nWhat follows is a transcription of the meeting as best as I can relay it. It\nis evident that Kailen, and his fellow that he called The Prince, displayed a\nformidable understanding of both sides of the potential conflict. He is a\nmost unusual mercenary and a compelling speaker, though of course this\ndoes not come across half so well in my approximation of the meeting.\n“May I ask the Ladus the size of the army he is amassing?” said Kailen.\n“The clans represented here have committed to me near eighteen\nthousand men and women. Do I speak right?” Raised voice, eliciting\napproval and some banging of cups.\n“And what would the Ladus say losses of such men might be, were\nVilmor to bring to bear an army estimated at twenty five thousand?”\n“Where do you get such numbers soldier?”\nThe Prince speaks then. “We served with Vilmor, as you no doubt\nalready know. They have seventy six fiefs, variously providing twenty to\ntwo hundred men and women.”\n“With these numbers, in open battle, the losses would be?” This was\nKailen.\n“Significantly higher on their side.” More cups were banged at this\npoint.\n“Ladus,” said Hasike, somewhat frustrated, “who bears the brunt of their\naggression? My clan. We are your border with Vilmor.”\n“As we border the Wilds,” said another, “but we do not cry to the Ladus\nover it.”"

We are your border with Vilmor.”\n“As we border the Wilds,” said another, “but we do not cry to the Ladus\nover it.”\n“The Wilds do not bring in twenty thousand men in front of a fortified\nsupply line,” said Kailen.\n“Bang your cups and brag if it pleases you, but you stand over a map\nthat shows clearly where Vilmor will push, through Hasike’s land and to the\nheart of Ahmstad.”\nThe Ladus raised his arms to quieten the shouts.\n“My council waits with bated breath for the wisdom of a Harudanian\nmercenary on its own affairs. I question your fitness to be part of this\ncouncil Hasike, that you have brought to our gathering men paid to chop up\nsoldiers when what we need is to outwit Turis’s generals.”\n“You ought consider Hasike wise, Ladus. I will gladly demonstrate\nwhy.” Remarkably, the mercenary sounded angry. I had expected him to be\nrun through at that point, for the Ladus enjoyed nothing more than\ndisemboweling everyone from servants to his own family for slights of\nhonour or even dark looks.\n“You have not begun to muster from your war communes, the sheriffs\nand quarters are still securing your supplies: wood, cattle, grain. The men at\nthis table await their levies, and the last time I fought Ahmstad I would not\nhold such hope for the weak and ill equipped majority that are enrolled.\nHasike’s lands will be pillaged and burned, some fifth of your tithe in\nbuffalo, a seventh of all your kannab crops.” He had the room now, though\nthe Ladus’s fist was white as it gripped the handle of his axe.\nKailen swept the arranged blocks from the map and reset them. He laid\nout the routes the Vilmorian army would take, the challenge for the\nAhmstad forces, and every way that he laid out their options they were to\nexpect heavy losses, even in victory.\nThe room was silent, for each anticipated deployment and stratagem had\nbeen devised and its consequences presented soundly.\n“I have a question,” said the Ladus, “if we are likely to lose, why have\nyou sold Hasike your services? Do you and your friend of some dubious\nroyal lineage plan to defeat Turis with your own hands?”\n“No. For one hundred and fifty gold pieces my friend of dubious royal\nlineage will explain why you need not raise a sword to defeat the forces of\nVilmor, gain yourselves land and new allies and weaken Turis\nsignificantly.”\nThe Ladus erupted with laughter. “If I’d wanted a fool I would have left\nmy first consort alive. I suppose you wish to be paid before you share your\ngrand plan with us as well?”\n“Listen to him, for my people’s sake,” said Hasike.\nThe Ladus was always a big and intimidating man, easily a foot taller\nthan anyone else in a room, and I’d seen him press and win, time and again,\nfrom Hasike for more cattle for the northern Ahmstad clans he favoured.\nHasike was desperate. The Ladus took a deep breath.\n“Fifty gold pieces. If I like what I hear you’ll get your hundred more, if\nnot you’ll swallow them and I’ll cut them out of your belly.” He turned his"

If I like what I hear you’ll get your hundred more, if\nnot you’ll swallow them and I’ll cut them out of your belly.” He turned his\nhead slightly towards where I stood with his treasurer, and a nod\ncommanded the treasurer to count out the coins. Kailen took the proffered\npouch as calmly as a man receiving payment for food, suggesting that,\nuniquely in my experience, his purses were of a not dissimilar amount.\nKailen’s man, The Prince, was, I learned shortly afterwards, called so\nbecause he was an heir to the throne of Old Ceirad. He had the Old\nKingdoms aristocracy in every bone, an educated, persuasive speaker. He\nalso used Ladus’s map and his blocks to explain his argument.\n“Vilmor, as I have said, is comprised of seventy-six fiefs. Your lands\nborder eleven of those fiefs. Of those eleven there are three that matter.\nThese three share a common ancestry with Hasike’s clan. You will have\nnoted how peaceful the border is there, compared to the Wilds and Razhani\nborders. Only Lagrad is more peaceful, and precisely because of your\nlongstanding treaty.\n“These three fiefs, comprising two clans, do not, shall we say, dine at the\ntop table with Turis and the bigger fiefs. Indeed, he has seen fit to put to a\nvote the redrawing of the fiefdoms in favour of a cousin whose land lies\nbehind theirs. His mistake, as I see it, has been to give his cousin the\noversight and control of levies, in the name of Turis, to see to the\nconstruction of the forts that now press against your borders, in those three\nlands.\n“As many of you in the room will testify, if the Ladus here designated\nHasike or anyone else to command your own men to build forts in the\nLadus’s name, irrespective of the cost to your lands and your harvests, you\nwould be displeased.” This earned a few grunts of approval.\n“Two castles have been built, at great cost to those fiefs, seven other\nwooden forts and the construction of bridges through some of the\nmarshlands that edge your borders give Vilmore the advantage of which we\nspeak.\n“I would suggest that the hundred gold pieces not be paid now, as I\nsummarize our plan, but upon its execution. Will you bind to that, Ladus?”\nYou now understand how interesting these two mercenaries are. The\nLadus is a great warrior, but a vain and ridiculous man. They understood\nthis, as they must have understood Hasike’s position as well as the\nintelligence they had gathered on the border before they approached Hasike\nand the Ladus. I was struck at that moment by the thought that one hundred\nand fifty gold pieces was not as preposterous as it initially seemed. Nor did\nKailen’s demeanour shift for a moment at this change in the agreement, as\nthough it too had been rehearsed.\nThe Ladus looked about the room, and I noted Kailen’s satisfaction. He\nhad concluded much as I did, that this gesture indicated Ladus did not have\nthe initiative or command here. He sought the faces of his clan leaders for\ntheir view on this offer, though it would have been madness to refuse.\n“Explain your plan,” he said."

He sought the faces of his clan leaders for\ntheir view on this offer, though it would have been madness to refuse.\n“Explain your plan,” he said.\nThe Prince continued. “Enfeoff the three clans, at the cost of one quarter\nof Hasike’s own lands and four of his herds. Make also a gift to each clan of\nfive hundred gold pieces, along with two hundred jars each of cocklebur\nseeds and the recipes for them. Commit also to fund a war commune there\nand give them a place on the council. In return…”\nThere were cries of “Disgrace!” and others much more colourful, but\nThe Prince continued over them.\n“In return you have extended your borders, united four clans that\nHansike will soon get control of, gained two castles and a number of forts\nand weakened Turis considerably on this front.”\nThough the hubbub continued a moment, the Ladus raised his hand for\nsilence.\n“Hasike?” he said.\n“I believe with some suitable marriages, the war commune in what\nremains of my territory and my family’s lineage in respect of these clans, I\nand my sons after me will take overall control of these lands, though I\nexpect, as The Prince has said, that they will accede to our offer willingly. I\ncan commit from my own men enough, with Kailen’s help, to secure the\ncastles while we secure the lands.”\nThe Ladus nodded. Hasike had improved his standing immensely. He\ntook some time, looking over the map, lost in thought.\n“Return with the agreements and I will have the payments ready, both\nfor those clans and these two mercenaries.”\nThe territory was duly won, Kailen and The Prince were proved right.\nI understand from some of the soldiers that I’d questioned regarding\nthem that Kailen commands only a crew of twenty, and they have been\nmaking a name for themselves wherever they’ve signed. They have not yet\nsigned a purse for a general that lost a battle.\nI recommend an introduction, we may learn much from this remarkable\nman.\nBy Joe Abercrombie\nTHE FIRST LAW TRILOGY\nThe Blade Itself\nBefore They Are Hanged\nLast Argument of Kings\nBest Served Cold\nThe Heroes\nRed Country\nTHE SHATTERED SEA TRILOGY\nHalf a King\nHalf the World\nHalf a War\nPraise for the\nFirst Law Trilogy\n“Abercrombie has written the finest epic fantasy trilogy in recent memory.\nHe’s one writer that no one should miss.”\n—Junot Diaz\n“There is a gritty edge to his world and an awareness of the human cost of\nviolence that is very contemporary.”\n—The Times\n“Delightfully twisted and evil.”\n—Guardian\n“An admirably hard, fast and unpretentious read.”\n—SFX\n“If you’re fond of bloodless, turgid fantasy with characters as thin as\nnewspaper and as boring as plaster saints, Joe Abercrombie is really going\nto ruin your day.

It’s clearly the characters that take center stage here.\nTheir dialogue is full of cynicism and wit, their lives full of intrigue, battles\nand magic.”\n—RT Book Reviews\n“Now that I’ve read the book for myself, not only was The Blade Itself\nbetter than I could have hoped for, but I find it hard to imagine anyone not\nliking this fantasy extravaganza.… To me, The Blade Itself is\nsimultaneously an homage to fantasy of old, a satirical riff on clichés\ncommon within the genre, and a contemporary revision… if you like\nfantasy but are tired of the same-old routines, enjoy a healthy dose of black\nhumor, are not afraid of a little over-the-top violence and foul language, and\nappreciate the writings of Glen Cook, Scott Lynch, and Steven Erikson,\nthen Joe Abercrombie’s The Blade Itself is tailor-made for you. Even if\nnone of that fits in your criteria, give the book a chance. You might just be\npleasantly surprised.”\n—Fantasy Book Critic\n“Critics compare Abercrombie to Dickens, but come on—Dickens was\nnever so entertaining. This intricate story just flows, carrying along\nbarbarian fighters with real courage (and real injuries), spoiled nobles with\nredeeming potential, mages with disconcerting agendas… plus the most\nsympathetic torturer ever. The First Law trilogy: an adventure whose\ncharacters grow in tough, surprising, satisfying ways, in a gritty, exotic\nworld that is sometimes awful, and always fascinates. Expect fast, funny\ndialog, and one hell of a rush.”\n—John Meaney, author of Paradox and Bone Song\n“Fans of character-driven epics who are willing to take their heroes with a\ngrain of moral ambiguity should add this novel to their ‘must read’ list.…\nThe Blade Itself is a smartly-written, sophisticated debut with compelling\ncharacters, a complex plot, and style to burn.”\n—Strange Horizons\n“Dark, deeply ironic and full of character gems that will appeal to your\ncynical side, Before They Are Hanged is as brilliant as its predecessor.”\n—SFRevu\n“The sword-and-sorcery trilogy that began with The Blade Itself and Before\nThey Are Hanged comes to a violent, sardonic and brilliant conclusion.…\nAbercrombie is a fresh new talent, presenting a dark view of life with wit\nand zest, and readers will mourn the end of this vivid story arc.”\n—Publishers Weekly\n“It’s delicious, the characters sharply drawn and their motivations\nbelievable, the clash of cultures (always particularly difficult for an author\nto pull off) believable as well.”\n—Lilith Saintcrow\n“Abercrombie is headed for superstar status.”\n—Jeff VanderMeer\nPraise for\nBest Served Cold\n“Joe Abercrombie’s Best Served Cold is a bloody and relentless epic of\nvengeance and obsession in the grand tradition.… The battles are vivid and\nvisceral, the action brutal, the pace headlong, and Abercrombie piles the\nbetrayals, reversals, and plot twists one atop another to keep us guessing"

This is his best book yet.”\n—George R. R. Martin\n“Joe Abercrombie takes the grand tradition of high fantasy literature and\ndrags it down into the gutter, in the best possible way. Monza is a beautiful\nmercenary who has sworn to kill the seven men who tried to kill her. No\nelves, no wands—just lots of down-and-dirty swordplay.”\n—Time magazine\n“Abercrombie writes dark, adult fantasy, by which I mean there’s a lot of\nstabbing in it, and after people stab each other they sometimes have sex\nwith each other. His tone is morbid and funny and hardboiled, not wholly\ndissimilar to that of Iain Banks.… Like Fritz Leiber you can see in your\nhead where the blades are going, what is clanging off what, the sweat, the\nblood, the banter. And like George R. R. Martin, Abercrombie has the will\nand the cruelty to actually kill and maim his characters.”\n—Lev Grossman\n“Abercrombie is both fiendishly inventive and solidly convincing,\nespecially when sprinkling his appallingly vivid combat scenes with humor\nso dark that it’s almost ultraviolet.”\n—Publishers Weekly\n“A satisfyingly brutal fantasy quest. Best Served Cold? Modern fantasy\ndoesn’t get much hotter than this.”\n—SFX\n“All in all, we can’t say enough good things about Mr. Abercrombie’s latest\naddition to the genre. It’s intelligent, measured, thoughtful, well paced and\nconsidered, but retains a sense of fun that has flavoured the rest of his\nexcellent bibliography. We can’t recommend it enough.”\n—SciFiNow\n“Best Served Cold was one of the best genre reads of the last decade,\nfulfilling Abercrombie’s considerable potential and then some. The book\ncombined the grim tone of George R. R. Martin with the vengeance-soaked,\nbloody epics of Quentin Tarantino and the mission-based structure of\nsomething like The A-Team.”\n—A.V. Club\n“Believe the hype.”\n—Waterstones Books Quarterly\nPraise for\nThe Heroes\n“Lord of the Rings as directed by Kurosawa.”\n—Wall Street Journal\n“Abercrombie never glosses over a moment of the madness, passion, and\nhorror of war, nor the tribulations that turn ordinary people into the titular\nheroes.”\n—Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n“Brilliant.”\n—Guardian\n“Magnificent, richly entertaining.”\n—Time magazine\n“The Heroes is as irresistibly inviting as a bowl of pistachios. After that first\ntaste, you’re going to find it almost impossible to stop until it’s all gone.”\n—Philadelphia Inquirer\n“Delivered in Abercrombie’s trademark witty style.… This is an action-\npacked novel full of brutality, black humor and razor-sharp\ncharacterization.”\n—SFX (5-star review)\n“It’s an excellent tale and arguably Abercrombie’s best book yet.… Its pace\nreally showcases his talent for differently voiced and realistically motivated\ncharacters… any genre fan can enjoy what’s one of the best fantasy books"

Abercrombie is fast supplanting George R. R.\nMartin as the standard by which all contemporary epic fantasy should be\nmeasured.”\n—Pornokitsch\n“This is Abercrombie’s best book to date.
