It was a\ngorgeous room, filled with art, astronomical instruments, rare books, and\nengineering puzzles; the playground of someone who views education with\na passionate eye. He’d left it largely untouched since taking control, and he\nhad decided that he quite liked the previous owner. He and Lindet would\nhave a very long, interesting discussion before he cut off her head.\nHe sat on a cushioned stool, facing east through a great stained-glass\nwindow, his eyes closed as he enjoyed this moment of quiet. Quiet was,\nafter all, a rare luxury. He wondered if it would cease altogether in the days\nto come. Most people thought that ruling was a luxury. He scoffed to\nhimself at the very thought. Ruling was a duty, a terrible responsibility that\nfew approached with any measure of real success.\nA rap on the door interrupted his ruminations, and Sedial rubbed at the\npain persisting behind his left eye before placing his hands serenely on his\nknees. “Come.”\nThe door opened to reveal the face of a middle-aged man with hard,\nangular features; a square jaw; and a military bearing. He was of middling\nheight with a powerful frame wrapped in the black tattoos of a dragonman.\nJi-Noren was, officially, Sedial’s bodyguard. In reality he was Sedial’s spy\nand military master, and one of about a dozen dragonmen that claimed\nloyalty to him rather than to the emperor.\n“Yes?” Sedial asked.\n“We found the girl.”\n“The girl?”\n“The one you gave to Ichtracia.”\nSedial snorted at the mention of his treacherous granddaughter. “Bring\nher in.”\nA few moments passed before Ji-Noren ushered in a petite Palo woman\nof about nineteen.

        "text": "of about nineteen. She was very attractive, if Sedial had been young enough\nto still enjoy that sort of pastime. She trembled violently as Ji-Noren laid\none hand on her shoulder. Plucked from among the poor natives in that\nimmense slum, Greenfire Depths, the girl had been meant as a peace\noffering to Ichtracia, a slave to do with as she wished. Ichtracia had simply\nreleased the girl and ignored Sedial’s orders.\nSedial looked the girl over for a few moments, reaching out with his\nsorcery in an attempt to find even the faintest trace of his granddaughter. If\nthey had spent any amount of time together, there would be something\nthere, even if just a whisper.\nNothing.\nHe produced a leather wallet from his sleeve and unrolled it to reveal a\nnumber of needles and glass vials. He drew one of the needles. “Give me\nyour hand.” The woman inhaled sharply. Her eyes rolled like a frightened\nhorse, and Sedial almost commanded Noren to cuff some sense into her.\nInstead, he reached out and seized her by the wrist. He pricked a vein on the\nback of her hand, smearing the drop of blood with his thumb before\nreleasing her.\nHe ignored the frightened sound she made and stared hard at the splash\nof crimson. He took a few shallow breaths, touching the blood with his\nsorcery, feeling it create a bridge between his body and hers, between his\nmind and hers. “When is the last time you saw Ichtracia?” he asked.\nThe girl’s bottom lip trembled. Sedial squeezed ever so gently with his\nsorcery, and words suddenly spilled out of her. “Not since the day you left\nme with her. She sent me away within minutes of you leaving!”\n“And you have had no contact with her since?”\n“No!”\n“Do you have even a guess at where she might be hiding?”\n“I don’t, Great Ka! I’m sorry!”\nSedial sighed and wiped the blood from his thumb using a clean scrap of\ncloth from the table beside him. He returned the needle to his wallet and\nrolled it up, then flipped his hand dismissively. “She knows nothing. Return\nher to the Depths.”\nJi-Noren gripped her shoulder, but the woman refused to turn away. Her\neyes locked on to his, her teeth chattering. “You…”\n“I what, my dear?” he asked impatiently. “I’m not going to torture you?”\nHe gave her his best grandfatherly smile. “Believe me, if I thought it would\nbe of any help, you would be on the way to my bone-eyes at this very\nmoment. But you are nothing more than a weak-willed bystander, and\ndespite what you may have been told, I do not crush insects out of spite.\nOnly necessity.” He gestured again, and within a moment the girl was gone.\nJi-Noren returned a few minutes later. He stood by the door, waiting in\nsilence while Sedial attempted to slip back into that blissful meditation he’d\nbeen holding on to earlier. It didn’t work. The moment of peace had passed.\nHis head hurt, the spot behind his eye throbbing intensely every time he\nused his sorcery. He gave a small sigh and struggled to his feet, crossing the\nroom to a writing desk, where he lowered himself into the chair and began"

He gave a small sigh and struggled to his feet, crossing the\nroom to a writing desk, where he lowered himself into the chair and began\nto sign a number of work orders redistributing Palo labor from the housing\nprojects in the north down to a new fortress under construction in the south.\n“We have no other way to find Ichtracia?” Ji-Noren asked quietly.\n“No,” Sedial replied as he skimmed a work order before adding his\nsignature at the bottom. “We do not. Mundane means have failed—we’ve\ninterrogated everyone with even a tenuous connection with her.”\n“And sorcerous means?”\n“Dynize Privileged learned to hide themselves from bone-eyes long ago.\nEven our family blood is not strong enough to allow me to crack her\ndefenses.”\n“What about the spy, Bravis?”\nSedial looked down at the bruising on his wrist. The bruising from one\ngranddaughter—from Ichtracia’s sorcery—the pain behind his eye from the\nother. “Ka-poel is protecting him,” he said quietly, raising his gaze to a little\nbox up on the shelf. The box contained the spy’s finger, as well as several\nvials of his blood. They had proven useless, but he kept them all the same.\n“I’ve widened the search to three hundred miles,” Ji-Noren said. “We\nwill catch them.”\nThe reassurance just provoked a spike of fury in Sedial’s chest. He\npushed it down, signing his name on a work order and pressing it with his\nofficial seal. He shouldn’t need soldiers combing cellars and ransacking\nattics to look for his granddaughter and that filthy spy. He was the most\npowerful bone-eye in the world. Finding them should be as easy as a\nthought.\nThe spot behind his eye throbbed. Second most powerful bone-eye,\nanyway. Despite his pained state, he felt a sliver of pride for Ka-poel. She\nwould have made an amazing pupil—or a powerful sacrifice. She may still\nprove to be the latter.\n“Ichtracia and the spy are either already on the other side of the\ncontinent, or they are hiding just beneath our noses. Continue to focus your\nefforts on the city.” He rose to his feet again, knuckling his back and giving\nJi-Noren a grin. “Ka-poel has spread herself thin. She protects dozens with\nher sorcery, instead of using it as a weapon. If she was not so distracted, she\nwould have killed me.”\nJi-Noren frowned, as if wondering how this could possibly be good\nnews.\nSedial patted Ji-Noren on the shoulder. “She will continue to make the\nsame mistake. Eventually, it will weaken her against my attacks, and I will\nbreak her.”\n“Ah. Do we know where she is?”\n“To the west, still. I can’t be entirely sure where, but I imagine she’s\nlooking for the last of the godstones.”\n“She doesn’t know we already have it.”\n“No, I don’t think she does.” Sedial turned to the dragonman. “You’re\nstill frowning.”\n“We have many enemies in this place,” Ji-Noren commented.\n“As we expected.”\n“More than expected,” Ji-Noren said. “And far more powerful.

Have\nyou read reports about what those two powder mages did to the army we\nsent after Lady Flint?”\nSedial ignored the question. One thing at a time. “Don’t worry yourself,\nmy friend,” Sedial said as he crossed the room toward the door. It was\nnearly teatime, and he might just be able to enjoy it before another\nmessenger arrived with some ridiculous problem that needed fixing. “We’ve\nwon almost every battle we’ve fought on this accursed continent. We\npossess two of the godstones. Once we’ve broken Ka-poel’s sorcery on the\nLandfall godstone, we will be in position to act.”\n“And Lady Flint, with that new Adran army up north?” Ji-Noren\ninsisted. “They have the third godstone.”\n“But they have no idea how to use it.” He paused, then added\nreassuringly, “They have, what, thirty thousand soldiers? We outnumber\nthem four to one in that region alone.”\n“They have Privileged and powder mages now.”\n“We’ll buy them off,” Sedial said. “The Adran delegation will be far\nmore pliant than Lady Flint’s stubbornness. She may have gained an army,\nbut she also gained the politics of the Nine. I suspect she’ll find the latter\nmuch harder to wield than the former.” He rested his hand on the door just\nas he heard footsteps pounding urgently up the stairs. He rolled his eyes and\nopened it just in time to see a messenger, covered in sweat and road dust,\ncome to a huffing stop. “What is it?” Sedial demanded.\n“We’ve done it, sir.”\nSedial was taken aback. “Done what?”\n“The godstone, sir. The Privileged and bone-eyes say that they’ve solved\nit.”\nIt took a few moments for the thought to register. “They’re certain?\nThey’ve broken my granddaughter’s seals?”\n“Yes, Great Ka. Absolutely certain.”\nSedial felt the grin spread on his face. He let out a relieved sigh and\ngave the messenger one curt nod before closing the door and hobbling back\nto the writing desk. “We’ve done it, Noren,” he breathed.\n“Congratulations, Great Ka,” Ji-Noren said warmly.\nSedial reached beneath the writing desk and produced a small cigar box\nmarked with his Household crest. It pulsed with sorcery as his fingertips\ntouched it, and continued to grow warmer and warmer until he managed to\nprick his own finger and press the blood to a special knot on the bottom of\nthe box. The box sprang open, revealing several dozen prepared envelopes\nlayered in protective wards. He drew them out almost reverently and\nhanded them to Ji-Noren. “Send these back to Dynize immediately.”\n“Are we sure we’re ready for this?” Ji-Noren asked with some surprise.\n“It is time to strike. Begin the purge.”\n“What of the emperor?”\n“The emperor is just another puppet. He’ll think that the purges are\nbeing conducted in his name.”\nJi-Noren looked down at the orders. For a moment, Sedial thought he\nsaw a flicker of hesitation. Understandable, of course. After such a long and\nbloody civil war, most Dynize were loath to spill the blood of their kin. Yet"

        "text": "saw a flicker of hesitation. Understandable, of course. After such a long and\nbloody civil war, most Dynize were loath to spill the blood of their kin. Yet\nthis was unavoidable. Enemies needed to be destroyed, both foreign and\ndomestic.\n“Can I trust you to stand beside me, my friend?” Sedial asked.\nJi-Noren’s gaze hardened. “To the death.”\n“Good.”\n“This is how it begins.”\n“No,” Sedial corrected gently. “It began decades ago. This is how it\nends.”\nCHAPTER 1\nM\nichel Bravis stood in the doorway of a small Kressian chapel, sipping\ncold morning coffee while he watched Palo fishermen pass him in the\nstreet, their early haul hanging from long poles balanced on their shoulders.\nHe examined each man and woman carefully, ticking them off mentally as\nhe watched for new faces or suspicious glances or any amount of curiosity\ntossed in his direction. They bragged to one another about their catch or\ntagged along in sullen, unsuccessful silence, but not one of them gave\nMichel a second glance.\nHe’d grown and shorn the blond dye out of his hair over the previous\nmonth, and he’d made sure to spend plenty of time in the sun each day to\nallow the natural strawberry red to come out in both his hair and his beard.\nA starvation diet had allowed him to lose nearly two stone, and every shop-\nwindow reflection reminded him that he had changed his look about as\nmuch as possible since leaving Landfall.\nTo the townspeople of this Palo fishing village about twenty miles up\nthe coast from Landfall, Michel was nothing more than just another Palo\nvagrant displaced from his home with the Dynize invasion. He spent his\nmornings on the chapel stoop, his afternoons cleaning fish at the only\nprocessing factory, and his evenings tucked into one of the dozen local pubs\nlistening to gossip and playing the occasional hand of cards with loose-\nlipped Dynize soldiers. He gathered information, he kept his head down,\nand most of all he waited for an opportunity to present itself that would\nallow him and Ichtracia to slip out of this place and head inland to find Ka-\npoel.\nMichel finished his coffee, tossing the grounds into the gutter and\nstowing his tin cup before slipping inside. He listened to the clatter of the\nbig chapel door swinging shut behind him and tried to resist fiddling with\nthe still-painful stub of the finger Sedial had cut off, hidden beneath\nbandages and a false splint. He took a deep breath and walked up the center\naisle of the chapel.\nTo all appearances, Ichtracia looked like a grieving widow. She wore a\nblack shawl and veil and sat hunched as if in prayer on the second row of\nbenches. Michel glanced around the empty chapel, then came to stand\nbeside her, raising his eyes to Kresimir’s Rope hanging above the altar. He\nnoted that someone had written “KRESIMIR IS DEAD” under one of the\nstained-glass windows of the nave.\nThe hard-drinking fisherwoman who acted as the town priest hadn’t\nbothered to scrub it off.\n“Are all Kressian churches like this?” Ichtracia asked, not raising her\nhead.\n“Like what?”\n“Dull.”"

        "text": "bothered to scrub it off.\n“Are all Kressian churches like this?” Ichtracia asked, not raising her\nhead.\n“Like what?”\n“Dull.”\nMichel considered the question. “The cathedrals are more impressive.”\n“I toured the one in Landfall. It certainly was big.” She didn’t sound\nimpressed.\n“Don’t Dynize have churches?” It had never occurred to him to ask\nbefore.\n“Not really, not in the same way. We’re supposed to worship the\nemperor in the town square, but no one really does that, except on public\nholidays.”\nThat sounded very similar to Michel’s own relationship with religion.\nHe’d never bothered with it as a boy, and as an adult he knew for a fact that\nKresimir was indeed dead. He worked for the pair that had killed the\nKressian god. “At least this keeps you from having to stay cooped up in our\nroom all day,” Michel suggested.\n“This bench is going to be the death of me.” Ichtracia stood suddenly,\nlifting her veil and stretching with a rather impious yawn. Ever since they\nhad snuck out of Landfall, she’d been posing as his brother’s widow. Or at\nleast, that was their story. No one had actually bothered to ask them yet.\nThe Dynize didn’t have a strong presence here beyond the isolated, passing\nplatoon, and the Palo simply didn’t care.\nBut such was Michel’s experience with aliases—they seemed\nunnecessary until suddenly one saved your life.\nShe continued, “Have you figured out how to get us out of here yet?”\nMichel grimaced. Ichtracia had, to this point, taken their entire\npredicament rather well. She even seemed to enjoy playing the role of an\nanonymous widow, relishing every set of eyes that slid past her without a\nflicker of recognition. But the sight of the pulped corpse of her\ngrandfather’s bodyguard was still fresh in Michel’s mind, along with her\ndemand that she be taken to her sister. He was as cognizant as ever of the\npower imbalance between them and feared the moment her patience ran\nout.\n“I have not,” he answered her. Something passed behind her eyes that\nmade the base of his spine itch. He gave her his most charming smile. “I’m\ntrying.”\n“I’m sure you are.” She didn’t sound convinced. “Any news from the\nwar?”\nMichel came around and dropped onto the bench, waiting until she’d\nreturned to her seat before he said, “A pitload of rumors. Lindet has retaken\nthe Hammer and is pushing east across Fatrasta. Her army is immense but\nmostly conscripts, and the Dynize are rallying their field armies to put her\ndown.” He frowned. “There are a lot of conflicting reports coming out of\nthe north—a whole Dynize field army disappeared. Another army has New\nAdopest under siege and is expected to take it and come south by the end of\nnext week.” To be honest, he was worried about that army. If they skirted\nthe coast, they could march right past this little town, and Michel was not\nthrilled about the idea of thirty thousand Dynize or more, along with\nPrivileged and bone-eyes, camped out nearby.

        "text": "thrilled about the idea of thirty thousand Dynize or more, along with\nPrivileged and bone-eyes, camped out nearby. Ichtracia claimed she could\nhide from any sorcery, but he didn’t want to put that to the test up close.\n“Anything out of Landfall?”\n“Just troop consolidation. Sedial is building a fortress around the\ngodstone and using Fatrastan labor to do it. Nobody knows how many\nKressians and Palo he’s hired, but rumor has it they’re being paid and fed\nwell, so there’s not a lot of complaining.”\nIchtracia sniffed. “You seem surprised that the Palo are being treated\nwell.”\n“We’ve always been second-class citizens at best,” Michel answered.\n“Slaves and subhumans at worst.” He felt something else on the tip of his\ntongue—the guarded secret that the Blackhat je Tura had told him just\nbefore his death. For weeks he’d wanted to ask Ichtracia what she knew of\nher grandfather’s attempts to activate the godstone, and for weeks he’d\nsuppressed that urge. He wasn’t sure whether he was worried she’d have no\nnew information for him—or worried that she knew all about it.\n“The Palo are Dynize cousins,” Ichtracia said. “He won’t treat them as\nwell as our own people, of course, but they aren’t exactly foreigners,\neither.” She frowned. “A fortress around the godstone. I wonder if he’s truly\nworried about Lindet and her conscript armies. Or if there’s something else\nhe’s up to.”\n“No clue,” Michel answered, studying the side of Ichtracia’s face. Did\nshe know? Was she lying to him this very moment? They’d been lovers and\ncompanions for some time now, but there were still a great many walls\nbetween them—and for good reason. He tried to shrug it off. It didn’t\nmatter. His only task now was to figure out a way to get them out of this\ntown and across to the other side of the continent. Once he reunited her with\nKa-poel, he could get back to Landfall and try to find out the truth.\nThe creak of the chapel door gave Michel a little jump, and he resisted\nthe urge to look over his shoulder as Ichtracia leaned forward and assumed\nthe role of praying widow. Michel touched her shoulder as if in comfort,\nthen got to his feet. If he left now, he’d have a couple hours listening to\nrumors in the pub before his afternoon shift.\nHe froze at the sight of the man standing just inside the chapel door,\nblinking several times to make sure that his eyes hadn’t tricked him.\n“Taniel?” he choked out.\nTaniel Two-shot looked like he’d aged a decade in the few months since\nthey’d last spoken. His riding clothes were filthy, his shoulders slumped,\nand his face was drawn out and haggard. A spot of silver had appeared at\nhis temples and he gave Michel a tired smile. “Hello, Michel.” He ran a\nhand through his hair. “You really are a damned chameleon. I would have\nwalked right out of here without recognizing you if you hadn’t said my\nname.”\n“What the pit happened to you?” Michel asked, slipping past Ichtracia\nand into the aisle.\n“I fought a couple of Dynize brigades,” Taniel said.

It sounded like a\njoke, but he didn’t smile when he said it. “I may have overdone it a bit.” His\neyes slid to Ichtracia, then back to Michel.\nIchtracia had gotten to her feet and now stared at Taniel in the same way\nMichel might have eyed an adder slithering through the door. Her fingers\ntwitched as if for the Privileged gloves in her pockets. A look of uncertainty\ncrossed her face. Michel cleared his throat. “Taniel, Ichtracia. Ichtracia,\nTaniel.”\n“Ichtracia,” Taniel said, rolling the name across his tongue. “This is our\nmole?”\n“I’m your sister-in-law, as I understand it,” Ichtracia said flatly.\nTaniel eyeballed her right back. “I thought your name was Mara.”\n“A nickname,” Michel explained. “It was a pain in the ass to find her,\nbut I did. Why didn’t you tell me she was Ka-poel’s sister?” He hadn’t\nmeant to ask—taking an accusatory tone with Taniel never ended well. But\nthe question just kind of slipped out.\nTaniel scowled for a moment before letting out a tired sigh. “I didn’t\nthink you needed to know.”\n“It might have narrowed things down.” Michel heard his own tone\nrising. All the annoyance he’d felt over the secrecy, no matter whether it\nwas important or not, began to slip through. “You also could have told me\nshe was a Privileged.”\n“That’s right.” Taniel cocked his head as if listening to some distant\nsound. “You’re hiding it very well. I didn’t sense anything when I came\nthrough the door.”\n“I’ve practiced a lot,” Ichtracia said. Her tone had gone from flat to\nannoyed. “So you’re the god-slayer?”\nTaniel’s expression turned serious. “What have you been telling her?” he\nasked.\nMichel threw up his hands, but Ichtracia answered before he could. “He\nhasn’t told me anything. The Dynize have spies all over the world. You\nwere supposed to have died ten years ago. When Michel told me who he\nworked for—who my sister is married to—I couldn’t help but assume that\nyou managed to finish the job you started on Kresimir.”\nTaniel snorted and walked to the last pew in the back of the chapel,\nsinking into it. “Lots of rumors,” he said wearily. “I’m sorry about the\nmisdirection, Michel. Pole and I decided together that it was best you figure\nout who and what Mar… Ichtracia was on your own. All we had to go on\nwas the name Mara. A nickname, you say?”\n“Something that our grandfather used to call us both as children,”\nIchtracia said. “It means we were his little sacrifices.”\nTaniel’s apologetic smile switched from Michel to Ichtracia. “I see.\nThank you for joining Michel. I can only imagine that we have a lot to\ncatch up on about each other. And that you want to see your sister.”\n“Where is she?” A note of eagerness entered Ichtracia’s voice."

I’m on my way to find her.”\nMichel watched Ichtracia. He wanted to tell her that she was in the\npresence of a great man. That she should show a little respect. But he was\njust annoyed enough at Taniel to keep his mouth shut. Besides, Ichtracia\nwas no slouch herself. “Speaking of finding,” he said. “How did you find\nus?”\n“I went to Landfall first,” Taniel replied. “I met with Emerald, and he\ntold me that you’d accomplished your mission and pointed me in this\ndirection. It’s… taken a couple of weeks.”\nMichel scowled. “We’ve been trying to figure out a way through the\nDynize roadblocks ever since we left. How did you just ride right into\nLandfall?”\n“One of Emerald’s people was waiting for me north of the city with\nforged papers.” Taniel patted his breast pocket. “No one’s looking for a\nsingle Kressian rider, and the papers say I’m a spy for the Dynize. There\nwere a few awkward questions, but I managed.”\nMichel made a frustrated sound in the back of his throat. If only it had\nbeen so easy for him and Ichtracia, they’d be on the other side of the\ncontinent by now rather than waiting in this little fishing village for an\nopportunity to slip away. “So you’re here to take Ichtracia to Pole?”\nTaniel gave Ichtracia a long glance. “I am.”\n“Wait,” Ichtracia said, giving Michel a confused look. “You’re coming\nwith us, right?”\n“You’re more than welcome,” Taniel added.\nMichel gave them both a tight smile. “I should. But I need to head back\nto the city.”\n“You’re mad!” Ichtracia exclaimed. She exchanged a glance with Taniel\nand then continued, “You know that Sedial is turning over the city looking\nfor you, right? The moment someone recognizes you, you’ll be captured,\ntortured, and killed.”\nMichel stared at his hands for a few moments, considering his words.\n“Michel?” Taniel prodded.\n“I’ve got unfinished business.”\n“What kind of business?” Taniel asked.\nMichel avoided Ichtracia’s gaze. Choosing his words with care, he said,\n“While I was there, I helped the Dynize hunt down the last of the Blackhats\nin the city.”\n“So Emerald told me,” Taniel replied.\n“I found and killed Val je Tura.”\n“The Gold Rose with the bastard sword?”\n“The same. Before he died, he told me something.” Michel hesitated\nagain, looking sidelong at Ichtracia. “He told me that the Dynize were\nscooping up Palo and using them in a blood ritual to activate the godstone.”\nThe moment the last word left his mouth, he knew that he’d been wrong\nabout Ichtracia—that he should have told her weeks ago. The blood drained\nfrom her face, her eyes widening. He expected an exclamation of surprise\nor denial or… something. Instead her jaw clamped shut.\n“Pit,” Taniel muttered."

It doesn’t matter if it’s the Kressians\nor the Fatrastans or the Dynize. I have to pit myself against the enemies of\nmy people. I’m of no use going along with you and Taniel. I need to head\nback into Landfall.”\n“I thought you said the Palo were being treated better under the\nDynize?” There was a note to her tone that Michel couldn’t quite place. It\nsounded like desperation.\n“I don’t know,” Michel said with a shrug. “Maybe? Or it could be\npropaganda. Whatever it is, I need to go back to Landfall and find out the\ntruth.”\nThe silence between them all grew deafening. Ichtracia stared at the\nwall. Taniel stared at Michel. Michel examined both their faces, trying to\nread something in them. Finally, Taniel cleared his throat. “Ka-poel is on\nher way to Dynize.”\n“What?” The word tore itself from Ichtracia’s throat as she whirled on\nhim.\n“She’s going to find the third godstone. I’m on my way to join her.”\n“She’s going to get herself killed, too! Why do all of you have a death\nwish?” Something in Taniel’s expression must have confused her, because\nshe stopped and took a sharp breath. “You don’t know?”\n“Know what?”\n“We already have the third godstone. It’s in Dynize, protected.”\nTaniel muttered something under his breath. “Good thing she has a\nbodyguard, I suppose. If that’s true, I don’t have a second to lose. I’ve got\nto cross the continent, catch a ship, and sneak into Dynize. It’ll take me\nmonths to catch up with her.”\nMichel scoffed. Taniel’s tone was optimistic, as if he were heading on a\npleasure cruise. But anything could happen in months, especially if Ka-poel\nstumbled headlong into Dynize. He almost asked Taniel to forget that idea\nand come with him to Landfall. But there was no hope in that. Taniel would\ngo wherever Ka-poel was.\n“Are you coming?” Taniel asked Ichtracia briskly. Michel could see in\nhis eyes that he’d already moved on from the conversation and was ready to\nbolt, like a racehorse waiting for the starting pistol.\n“No.”\nMichel rounded on her. “What do you mean, no?”"

Her left eye and cheek twitched, a\ncascade of emotions crossing her face in the space of a moment.\n“Your sister…”\n“I can meet her when this is over!” she said forcefully. Quieter, to\nherself, she echoed, “When this is all over. Do we have a way to get back\nin?” she asked Taniel.\n“Emerald sent a couple of Dynize passports for the two of you,” Taniel\nsaid. “They were meant for you to accompany me across the country, but I\nassume they’ll get you back into Landfall without a problem.”\nMichel swallowed. He had been with Ichtracia long enough to see that\nshe would not take no for an answer. His mentioning of the blood sacrifices\nhad set something off in her. He felt like he should know what, but he was\ntoo taken up with his own plans to pinpoint the source of her distress. He\nimmediately shifted his thinking, discarding all the ideas he’d had for a one-\nman operation and changing them to work for two.\n“We’ll take the passports,” Ichtracia said.\n“I think…” Michel began.\n“Don’t think,” she snapped at him. “You should have told me about your\nintentions. You should have told me about the sacrifices. Mara!” She\nthumped her chest. “Mara! Sacrifice. That blood should have been mine!\nInstead, he’s killing thousands of innocent people to get the job done. I’m\ngoing with you, and that’s final.”\nCHAPTER 2\nB\nen Styke rested on the forecastle of a small transport ship called the\nSeaward, his big boz knife in one hand and a whetstone in the other,\nlistening to the swell of the ocean and the calling of gulls undercut by the\noccasional slow rasp as he sharpened his blade. He wore a large, floppy hat\nto keep the sun from his face, despite the fact that Celine had told him on\nseveral different occasions that it made him look ridiculous.\nHe caught sight of one of the sailors staring in his direction and\nwondered if it was just the hat or him. Two weeks at sea, and the sailors still\nseemed uneasy to have twenty Mad Lancers and Ben Styke sleeping in their\nhold. The fear suited Styke just fine—if it meant that someone jumped\nwhen he said jump, it made his life easier. He wondered what they’d think\nif he told them about the genuine Dynize blood witch who had\ncommandeered the first mate’s cabin.\nAt the thought, Styke raised his head and swept his gaze across the deck\nfor Ka-poel. He hadn’t seen her much since they’d set sail. In fact, ever\nsince the battle at Starlight, she’d looked exhausted, and had slept no less\nthan fourteen hours a day.

        "text": "since the battle at Starlight, she’d looked exhausted, and had slept no less\nthan fourteen hours a day. He suspected that the sorcerous power struggle\nshe’d had with her grandfather had done more damage to her than she’d\ncare to admit. He wondered if he should ask her outright—he needed her in\ntop shape for this mission—but immediately discarded the thought. She was\nstill alive, still moving, and she had enough energy to snicker silently at his\nhat.\nShe’d be fine. She would have to be.\nStyke lifted his eyes farther up, to the mainmast, where he spotted\nCeline just as she leapt from the rigging and walked—no, ran—out to the\nend of the spar. He swallowed a lump in his throat and the urge to yell,\nreminding himself that he was jumping between galloping horses at that\nage. Eyes narrowed, he watched as she deftly untied a knot, let some slack\nout into one of the sails, then retied it and returned to the rigging, where a\ntrio of sailors gave her a proud cheer. He had to admit, in these last two\nweeks she’d become startlingly good at navigating the rigging, sails, and\nknots on the ship.\nHe had no intention of telling her of the chat he’d had with the first mate\nto ensure that the sailors did not ask her to do anything beyond her size or\nstrength.\nStyke returned his gaze to his knife, drawing it across the whetstone a\nfew more times, and tried not to look to starboard, where the rocky,\ncypress-choked Dynize shore dominated the horizon. The sight of it would\nonly frustrate him: so close he could practically touch it, and yet he was no\ncloser to his destination.\nFour days ago, just when they were nearing Dynize, an immense gale\nhad scattered his fleet. Dozens of transports and their heavily armed escorts\nhad been caught up in the storm. When it finally passed, the Seaward had\nfound itself all alone and blown a couple hundred miles north of their\nrendezvous point on the Dynize shore. Styke had no way of knowing how\nmany of the ships had been lost, or how badly they’d been dispersed. He\ndidn’t know if half of his Lancers had drowned, or been dashed against the\nshore, or if his entire army of twenty-five hundred cavalry had already\nlanded and was waiting impatiently for him to arrive.\nRegardless, the Seaward sailed south at speed, hoping to make up for\nlost time and avoid any Dynize warships along the way.\nA shout brought his attention back up to the mainmast, where a boy in\nthe crow’s nest waved desperately toward the aftcastle. There was a sudden\ncommotion, and the sailors sent Celine scampering down the rigging as\ntheir fun was replaced by an air of seriousness. The watchman gave another\nshout and pointed to the southern horizon, but the sound was lost on the\nwind.\nStyke put away his knife and whetstone, climbed reluctantly to his feet,\nand headed across the forecastle, down the main deck, and up to the\naftcastle where Captain Bonnie stood staring pensively through her looking\nglass to the southeast. Bonnie was an old seadog; a piece of shoe leather in\ntattered pants and a tricorn hat, her skin so dark from the sun she might"

Bonnie was an old seadog; a piece of shoe leather in\ntattered pants and a tricorn hat, her skin so dark from the sun she might\nhave been Deliv for all Styke knew. He sidled up beside her and waited for\nher report. They were soon joined by Jackal and Celine. The Palo Lancer\nmussed Celine’s hair and got a jab in the ribs for his effort, then gave Styke\na very serious nod.\n“You get anything new out of those spirits of yours?” Styke said just\nloudly enough to be heard over the wind.\n“No,” Jackal reported, glancing down toward the first mate’s cabin\nbelow them, where Ka-poel was resting. “They still won’t come near the\nship, not with her hanging about. I almost coaxed one to me yesterday—\nthere are the spirits of Dynize sailors this close to shore, and they seem less\nscared of her, but…” He trailed off with a shrug.\nStyke opened his mouth to respond, but was interrupted by Bonnie.\n“Here,” she said, thrusting the looking glass into his hands. “Directly\nsoutheast, ahead of us, you’ll see a point on the horizon.”\nHe put the glass to his eye. It didn’t take long to find the point she’d\nreferenced. Three points, actually; three sets of sails, all of them black with\nan arc of red stars across the center. “Dynize ships,” he said.\n“Very astute,” Bonnie responded with a snort. “Any idea what they are?”\nHe gave her a flat look until she cleared her throat and continued. “Two\nfrigates escorting one of those big monstrosities the Dynize call a ship of\nthe line. Trios like that have been sweeping the ocean ever since the Dynize\ninvaded. We call them the three-headed serpent.”\n“Have they seen us?”\n“They have much higher masts than the Seaward, so I’d be shocked if\nthey haven’t—and if not, they will any minute.”\nStyke felt his stomach lurch as he considered the possibilities. Their\nlittle transport was barely armed. He hadn’t chosen it for his own vessel\nbecause of size or power, but rather because Bonnie was the most\nexperienced captain in the commandeered fleet and knew the Dynize shore\nbetter than anyone else. “Shit,” he said.\n“Shit indeed.” She raised the looking glass to her eye for another few\nmoments. “They’re already headed in this direction.” She paused,\nfurrowing her brow. “Ah. The frigates are beginning to split off. They’ve\ndefinitely seen us, and they’re already preparing to widen the net. Probably\nhoping to get out far on our portside before we notice them.” She half\nturned toward the first mate and barked loudly, “Bring her around to\nstarboard!”\nA flurry of commotion followed as sailors scampered to adjust the sails.\nStyke felt a growing alarm. “We’re turning around?” he demanded.\n“Yes, we’re turning around,” Bonnie replied acidly. “And don’t try to\nwave that knife in my face, because that won’t help shit. You may be Mad\nBen Styke but I’m Perfectly Sane Bonnie. I can outrun those frigates"

I can outrun those frigates\nwithout too much of a problem, but if I try to slip past them, they’ll turn us\ninto driftwood.”\nStyke wondered if she’d rehearsed that speech for just such an occasion.\nHe glared toward the south, doing sums in his head. “And your plan is…?”\n“My plan is to run away north until they can’t see us anymore. Then\nwe’ll cut far, far east and come back around to reach the rendezvous. With\nany luck, they’ll assume they chased us off and continue patrolling the\ncoastline.”\n“And how long will that take?”\nBonnie shrugged. “Depends on the wind, the weather, and if we run into\nany more patrols. Fifteen days? Ten, if we’re lucky. Twenty or thirty or\nmore if we’re not. We might even have to go resupply at Starlight.”\nStyke grit his teeth and shared a long look with Jackal. Twenty more\ndays until they met back up with Ibana and the rest. Twenty days behind\nschedule. What a goddamned disaster. He briefly considered how badly it\nwould go if he did wave his knife under Bonnie’s nose. He might have a\nreputation, but her sailors outnumbered his Lancers three to one and he\nneeded those sailors to get him to shore. The last thing he needed was to\nspark a mutiny against his commandeered authority.\nThe ship creaked as it came around, putting the Dynize vessels behind\nthem and the shore on their portside. Sailors shouted and scrambled,\naccomplishing the maneuver in an impressively short period of time.\nStyke’s mind jumped to the old maps in Bonnie’s cabin. They were the\nmost up-to-date maps of Dynize available, which meant that the coastlines\nwere all accurate, but inland hadn’t been seen for over a hundred years.\nThat shouldn’t make a difference, not for his purposes. “Find us a place to\nput to shore,” he said.\n“Excuse me?” Bonnie’s head jerked toward him, a look of disbelief on\nher face.\n“You heard me. Get us as close as you can to the shore and weigh\nanchor. I want both your cranes put up and plopping my horses into the\nocean. Give us three longboats and all our supplies, then you can run from\nthose frigates to your heart’s content and head straight back to Starlight.”\n“You’re insane.”\nStyke tapped his knife. “Find us a beach where I can swim twenty-five\nhorses ashore without getting them all killed.”\n“Don’t you need us to get back to Fatrasta?”\n“Not if I can meet up with the rest of the fleet.”\n“And you’ll do that going overland?”\nStyke grinned at her.\nHesitantly, Bonnie turned her eye to the shore and gave a weary sigh. “I\nthink we might be near a place. I’ll give the order. Tell your men to be ready\nto go in an hour. This will be the fastest landing you’ve ever experienced.”\nBonnie strode away, barking orders, and Styke turned back to Jackal.\n“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Jackal asked."

Because I need you to pilfer all of Bonnie’s maps of Dynize.”\nCeline scowled. “If she catches me, she’ll throw me over the side.”\n“We’re about to do something really stupid, and those maps are gonna\nbe the only way to accomplish it. Besides, we’re all going overboard\nanyway.”\nCeline considered this for a moment, then gave him a wicked little grin\nthat he swore she learned from Ka-poel. “Okay, I’ll do it. But not until\nwe’re about to jump into the longboats. That’ll be the best way to make a\nclean getaway.”\n“Smart girl. Now, go wake up Ka-poel. Tell her she’s home.”\nStyke stood on a rocky outcropping and watched as the Seaward\ndisappeared around a nearby bend, heading north at full sail just out of gun\nrange of the nearest of the two pursuing Dynize frigates. It would be close,\nbut Captain Bonnie had been confident she could still make a clean\ngetaway. The Dynize frigate fired off a single shot from a small bow gun,\nbut Styke watched it splash into the ocean, well short of its target. Waiting\nuntil the Seaward was completely out of sight, he climbed down from his\noutcropping and headed down to the stream outlet, where his men were\nunloading the longboats.\n“Report,” he said to Jackal, splashing into the water and eyeballing a\nlong-snouted swamp dragon half-submerged a little way upstream.\n“Everyone made it safely ashore,” Jackal responded. He sucked gently\non his teeth. “One of the spare horses broke a leg coming around that reef.\nHad to put him down.”\n“Just the one?” Styke had heard the beast screaming, and the gunshot\nthat put it out of its misery.\n“Just the one,” Jackal confirmed.\n“That’s better than I expected.” He groaned inwardly. They had five\nextra horses, and more than a hundred miles of wilderness to cross with\nthem. Facing difficult terrain, swamp dragons, big snakes, and whatever the\npit else this blasted continent would throw at them, he expected to lose\nplenty more before they could meet up with Ibana. But having his feet on\nfirm ground again felt good. At least he was in control of his own fate\nagain. “Everyone has their armor?”\n“They do. Markus has loaded up Amrec. Sunin is helping Celine get\nMargo saddled.”\n“Saddles stay dry?\nA nod. “Sunin dropped her carbine. I had to give her one of the extras.”"

        "text": "Margo saddled.”\n“Saddles stay dry?\nA nod. “Sunin dropped her carbine. I had to give her one of the extras.”\nStyke rolled his eyes. “Why is she so old?”\n“I think…”\n“It was a rhetorical question.” He looked around until he found Ka-poel\nand Celine sitting on the opposite bank of the inlet, then waded over to\nthem. Even after two weeks of rest, Ka-poel looked thin and strung out, but\nher eyes were alert. She flashed a series of signs, most of which Styke\nfollowed. He let Celine translate anyway.\nThis looks like the Tristan Basin.\n“It does, doesn’t it?” Styke felt something fly into his mouth and quickly\nspat it out. “Same shitty trees and bugs and snakes and…” He trailed off,\nspotting the eyes of another swamp dragon watching them from forty feet\nupstream. “Swamp dragons look a little different, though. Keep your eyes\nout for them. Some of the bigger ones won’t hesitate to snap at a man, and\nmay even go for a horse.”\nKa-poel rolled her eyes. I know, Celine translated the next gesture.\n“Right. You grew up in that shithole, didn’t you?” Styke glanced at the\nsurrounding terrain. Despite the similarities, it was actually quite different\nfrom the Tristan Basin over in Fatrasta. While the Basin was very flat with\nthick, almost impassable flora, this swamp was littered with rocky\noutcroppings that ranged from boulders a few feet high to violent spines of\nrock that thrust above the mighty cypress trees. They hadn’t even started\ntheir trip to the interior yet, but he could already tell that the rivers would be\ndeeper, the lowlands unpredictable, and the terrain difficult for horses. “Just\nkeep your eyes out for swamp dragons,” he reiterated before turning back\nand wading to the longboats.\nHe cleared his throat loudly and gestured for the men to gather around,\ngiving them a long, hard stare as they secured their horses, set aside\ninventory, and came to join him. He took a deep breath. Twenty men. Over\na hundred miles of unpredictable swamp. This was going to be terrible.\n“All right, here’s the plan. Some of you might have already heard—we\nmade landfall because our alternative was running with Captain Bonnie all\nthe way back to Starlight and trying, from there, to rendezvous with Ibana.”\nHe gestured to Celine. “Bring me those maps,” and then continued speaking\nto the Lancers, “Dropping us here means we have a chance to cut across the\ninterior a damned lot faster than three weeks.”\nSomeone coughed.\n“Who was that?” Styke demanded. “Zac? Speak up.”\nZac coughed again and looked around sheepishly. The scout tried to find\nsome sort of backup from his brother, but Markus just shook his head. “Uh,\nBen,” Zac finally said. “Is this what the whole wilderness looks like?”\n“As far as I know, yes.”\n“There isn’t a damned way we’re going to make it a hundred miles\nmuch faster than twenty days, not in this terrain.”\nStyke took the waxed leather map tube Celine stole from Captain\nBonnie and popped the cap, then rummaged through the maps inside until"

        "text": "much faster than twenty days, not in this terrain.”\nStyke took the waxed leather map tube Celine stole from Captain\nBonnie and popped the cap, then rummaged through the maps inside until\nhe found the one he wanted. He spread it gently on the lip of the longboat,\nand everyone shifted to crowd around him. It was a map of a region in the\nnortheast of Dynize called the Jagged Fens. “We’re here,” he said, pointing\nto a nondescript little inlet. “The rendezvous is here.” He tapped on another\nspot. On the map, the distance seemed negligible, but Zac was right; it\nwould be impossible in these conditions. “You see this?”\nA few of the men leaned forward to squint at the paper. “Is that a road?”\nMarkus asked.\n“It’s a coastal highway cutting through the Fens.”\n“This map is a century old,” Jackal pointed out quietly. “Is the road even\nthere anymore?”\nIt better be, Styke thought. This plan had sounded less crazy in his head\nback aboard the Seaward. Aloud, he said, “I don’t see why it wouldn’t be.\nWe’re just a couple miles to the east. I figure we can get there by morning.\nOnce we’re on packed dirt, we’ll be able to ride hard to meet up with the\nrest of the Lancers. There are a handful of small towns between us and\nthem. Worst case, we throw on our armor and ride through.”\nThe small group began to murmur thoughtfully among themselves, and\nhe saw the idea take root. He himself wasn’t as convinced. In fact, he was\nbeginning to think this might be one of his stupider ideas. But the important\npart was pointing the Lancers at a goal and getting them moving. He could\ndeal with complications as they arose.\nStyke rolled the map back up, then returned the map tube to Celine.\n“Keep this safe,” he told her. “And the rest of you… finish inventory and\nget your horses saddled and ready to move. I want to be off the coast as\nsoon as possible.”\nThe group threw themselves into action, and Styke headed to give\nAmrec a once-over before making sure that Celine and Ka-poel’s horses\nwere hale and ready to ride. Less than a half hour passed before he could\nsee the soldiers were ready to leave. He instructed them to haul the\nlongboats farther upstream, and turned when he heard a voice call out his\nname. It was Celine, standing up on the vantage point he’d used to watch\nthe Seaward slip away earlier.\nStyke climbed up to join her and immediately saw the problem. Not far\nfrom shore, right around where the Seaward dropped them off, the big\nDynize ship of the line had arrived and put down her anchor. The immense\ndeck swarmed with sailors and soldiers, the latter of which were piling into\nlongboats by the dozen. The first boat dropped into the water as Styke\nwatched. Then the second, then the third.\nHe’d expected one of the frigates to send a small landing party to see\nwhat they were up to. But this big ship of the line was sending at least sixty\nnaval infantry. Too many to deal with in a single, savage ambush, and\nprobably better trained than normal sailors.

The Mad Lancers needed to get\noff this coastline immediately.\n“Is that bad?” Celine asked.\nStyke pushed her gently down toward the waiting Lancers. “Yes,” he\nsaid. “That’s very bad.”\nCHAPTER 3\nV\nlora stood with her back to the entrance of her tent, thumbing absently\nthrough an old journal that she’d recovered from the bottom of her travel\ntrunk just a few moments ago. At one point, it had been decorated with a\nrather ornate lock, but that had been dislodged by the jostling of tens of\nthousands of miles of travel. The black leather cover was well worn, the\npages yellow from age and moisture, and the stitched teardrop of Adro\nbarely visible in the center of the cover.\nIt was Tamas’s journal, a seeming hodgepodge of dated notes and\nremembrances covering nearly two decades, the pages stuffed with old\nletters to and from his long-deceased wife. Vlora handled the pages with\ncare, glancing at a few of the dates and letters, most of them written before\nshe was born.\nSomeone cleared his throat behind her as she crossed her tent to set the\njournal on her cot, then turned to face the small group that had gathered at\nher request. Every movement brought pain, and she handled herself with\nnearly as much care as she did the journal, careful not to show just how\nbadly her body had been mauled. She almost laughed at the efforts. Here\nshe was, with her most trusted friends and companions, and she wouldn’t\nallow herself to show them her pain. Well, no matter. They’d learn some of\nit soon enough.\nBorbador sat on a stool in the corner of the tent, legs crossed, fingers\ndrumming on his false leg while he puffed casually on an obscenely large\npipe that he had to support with one hand just to keep it in his mouth. His\nface was expressionless, but his eyes had that thoughtful, amused look in\nthem as if he’d just remembered something funny. He’d grown his ruddy\nbeard out since Vlora last saw him, and she decided she preferred the look.\nPrivileged Nila stood behind Bo, leaning on his shoulder, playing with a\nstrand of his hair, looking vaguely annoyed. Her hair was braided tightly\nover each shoulder, and she wore one of the crimson dresses that she liked\nso much. She looked up suddenly, meeting Vlora’s eyes, and Vlora found\nher own gaze flinching away.\nThe rest of the party consisted of Vlora’s three powder mages: the dark-\nhaired Davd; the grizzled, highly experienced Norrine; and the quiet Kez\nex-noble Buden je Parst. Vlora determined that it had been Bo who cleared\nhis throat, and so let her gaze settle on him for a long moment before\nrunning it back across the others.\n“Your recovery seems to be coming along nicely,” Nila commented\nbefore Vlora could speak.\n“You look… better,” Davd offered.\nNorrine looked up from cleaning her pistol. “We were worried about\nyou.”\nVlora waved away the encouragement and swallowed a grimace at the"

        "text": "“You look… better,” Davd offered.\nNorrine looked up from cleaning her pistol. “We were worried about\nyou.”\nVlora waved away the encouragement and swallowed a grimace at the\ntwinge that ran down her arm. She looked like a goddamned patchwork\ndoll. Her entire body was covered with scars from the battle at the Crease\nover five weeks ago. Some of them, the smaller ones, were healing nicely.\nThe rest… not so much. Neither Bo nor Nila specialized in healing sorcery,\nthough they had both studied it in depth. It had taken them four days just to\nkeep Vlora from dying and another five before she could be carried with the\narmy as it traveled. Another whole week had passed before Vlora could\nwalk on her own.\nThis was the first day she’d called her powder mages in for review; the\nfirst day she’d done anything beyond issue marching orders, ride along in a\ncovered litter, or stew in the humid heat of her tent. She swallowed bile and\nclenched her fists behind her back. “Thank you for the kind words,” she\nsaid softly. “But I have something important to discuss with the five of you.\nBo already knows.”\nNila looked up sharply, then down at Bo with a cocked eyebrow. “What\nis it?”\nVlora glanced across the group, swallowed again, cleared her throat, and\nfound that she could not give voice to the thing that had haunted her since\nthe second she regained consciousness. She coughed, tried to meet the eyes\nof her underlings, and failed. After a few moments, she forced herself to\nlook Norrine in the eye—she was, after all, the most experienced of the\nmages. She would have to take up most of the slack.\n“She can’t use her sorcery,” Bo announced. Vlora shot him a glare, but\nhe continued. “The effort at the Crease has burned her out, made her\npowder blind.”\nAll three of Vlora’s mages stared at her. She could tell by their\nexpressions that Norrine was not surprised—she’d probably expected it\nafter seeing the carnage of the battle—but the other two were clearly taken\noff guard. Davd took a full step back, blinking in disbelief. Buden scowled.\nBefore they could ask questions, she continued where Bo left off.\n“This may or may not be permanent.” Who was she kidding? It was\npossible to recover from powder blindness, but it took time. “You all know\nthe stories, the notes Tamas kept about his students.” She paused to blink\naway a few tears and take a deep breath. “The most important thing right\nnow is that we continue as we have been. Absolutely no one beyond this\nroom must know. Do you understand?”\nThere were a few dull nods.\n“That goes for you two as well,” Vlora said to Bo and Nila.\n“Oh, come now,” Bo objected.\n“You are a bit of a gossip, dear,” Nila said thoughtfully to Bo, studying\nVlora with an intensity Vlora did not like. “Of course,” she said. “We won’t\nsay a word.”\n“Yes, yes,” Bo agreed. He glared at his pipe, then tapped it out against\nhis false leg and stowed it in his jacket pocket. “You’ve been having us"

        "text": "say a word.”\n“Yes, yes,” Bo agreed. He glared at his pipe, then tapped it out against\nhis false leg and stowed it in his jacket pocket. “You’ve been having us\nmarch south since you woke up. I assume that means you have a destination\nand a plan for what to do next?”\nOn to the next thing. Typical Bo, and Vlora was grateful for it. She had\nno doubt that she would dwell on the loss of her sorcery every spare\nmoment from now until she died. Any distraction was welcome right now.\n“Of course. Thanks to you, I am in command of the greatest army on this\ncontinent. I intend on taking it to Landfall, where we will relieve the Dynize\nof their godstone and destroy it.”\nNorrine nodded along, as if this was what she’d expected. The other two\npowder mages still seemed too shell-shocked to respond. Bo lifted his hand\nlike a schoolchild.\n“Yes?” Vlora asked.\n“I handed you a very nice army, but it’s still the smallest fighting force\nby far. The Dynize and the Fatrastans both outnumber us by at least five to\none. The Dynize want to kill you. The Fatrastans want to arrest you. Do you\nplan on fighting them both?”\n“If necessary.”\n“What does that even mean?” Bo demanded.\nVlora wasn’t entirely certain herself. The Dynize were enemy number\none right now—they’d come dangerously close to killing her and her\nbrigade of mercenaries. Fatrasta, though? Lindet’s betrayal at Landfall still\nstung deeply. Vlora would not—could not—trust them. Which left her on a\nforeign continent swarming with enemy armies.\n“It means destroying the godstone is our only purpose. We’ll go through\nwhoever we have to in order to accomplish that goal.”\nBo exchanged a glance with Nila. After several seconds too long, he\nsaid, “Fair enough.”\nVlora tried not to read too much into the hesitation. Taniel’s initial\nreaction to the godstone had been to study it, and it had taken some\ninsistence to bring him around. Bo was infinitely more curious than Taniel,\nso she would have to keep a close eye on him. He would never betray her\noutright, but he was a man rife with ulterior motives.\n“You haven’t actually told us how you plan on doing that,” Nila pointed\nout.\nVlora gave her smile with humor she didn’t feel. “The Adran way.”\n“Oh, well that explains everything.”\nVlora ignored the sarcasm. “I just needed to tell the five of you about\nmy… condition. Now that that’s over with, back to business. Bo, I’d like\nyou and Nila to check in with the artillery commander. We’re going to end\nup in a full-fledged battle at some point in the next few weeks and I want\nyou all coordinated. Mages, I’m going to want one of you on hand at all\ntimes. You’ll have to be my sorcery—to tell me anything I should know\nand, if need be, to protect me. Eight-hour shifts, every day. I’ll let you\ndecide on the rotation.

        "text": "and, if need be, to protect me. Eight-hour shifts, every day. I’ll let you\ndecide on the rotation. Dismissed.”\nThe powder mages snapped their salutes and left the tent without\nanother word. Nila followed them, pausing at the flap with a glance back,\nwhile Bo remained on the stool in the corner, watching Vlora the way an\nasylum doctor might watch one of his patients.\n“That includes you,” Vlora said to Bo, returning to her cot and picking\nup Tamas’s journal.\nBo waited until Nila had gone, then said in a soft voice, “You’re sure\nyou’re strong enough for this? We don’t have Taniel anymore. He’s off to\nAdom knows where, and I’m not sure when he’ll be back.”\n“Of course I’m sure.” She was not. Not even close, and she knew it. Just\nlifting Tamas’s journal brought a tremble to her hand that she could not\nafford to let her soldiers see. “I have to be.”\n“Right,” Bo said flatly. He didn’t believe her. “I’ll be within shouting\ndistance. If you need me…” He exited the tent, his false leg clicking as he\nwent.\nVlora stood with her eyes closed in meditation for several minutes,\nwilling her body to stop its shaking, pushing away the pain. It took all of her\nfocus, and she instinctively reached for her sorcery every few moments,\nonly to feel the pang of loss when it didn’t come within her grasp.\nFinally, she let out one trembling breath and fetched her sword from the\ncorner. The blade was practically destroyed from her fight at the Crease; the\nsteel notched, the tip bent, rust destroying what was left. There was still\nDynize blood in several of the deepest gouges, and she hadn’t had the\nenergy to give it a proper cleaning. Still, the scabbard was in good shape, so\nshe took the weapon as a cane and stepped out into the still morning air.\nThey’d set up her tent within spitting distance of the general-staff\ncommand center, on a knoll overlooking the Blackguard River Valley.\nSpread out before her was the army Bo had brought with him from Adro:\nthirty thousand infantry, eight thousand cavalry, and a full artillery\ncontingent to accompany each brigade. It was, as she’d told her\ncompatriots, the best fighting force on the continent—the best trained, the\nbest outfitted, the best armed.\nAcross the valley, just on the other side of the small Blackguard River\nbeside a picturesque copse of trees, was the town of Lower Blackguard. Her\narmy had only arrived late last night, so this was the first time she’d set\neyes on it herself. Still, she knew the area well by a study of local maps.\nThe town’s population was only around five hundred—it was the center of\ntrade for the local tobacco and cotton plantations—but a city of tents now\noverflowed the town limits. The Fatrastan flag had been replaced by the\nblack-and-red of the Dynize.\nVlora tore her eyes away from that flag and looked around.

She gave the lot of them a cool, dismissive look before turning to\nDavd, who stood at attention beside the tent.\n“Where’s Olem?” she asked.\nDavd started. “Uh, he’s still gone, ma’am.”\nVlora peered at Davd. There were bits and pieces missing from the last\nfew weeks. Olem was one of them. She had no memory of being told that\nhe’d ever left. “Where?”\n“Escorting the godstone capstone to the Adran fleet, ma’am, as well as\nthe Riflejack wounded.”\n“Ah, I remember now.” She didn’t. “Thank you. Let me know the\nmoment he returns.”\nDavd looked nervous. “Yes, ma’am. Can I do anything else for you?”\n“Tell me where our artillery unit is.”\n“This way, ma’am.”\n“Lead on.” Vlora began the slow, methodical descent from the vantage\nof her knoll, leaning heavily on her sword. Davd kept pace with her, glaring\nat the passing camp followers and saluting soldiers with outward hostility as\nif their mere presence might upset her. His protectiveness was at once\ntouching and irritating, but Vlora let it pass. If Davd’s glares meant she was\nspared a few more hours until people started asking her stupid questions, so\nmuch the better.\nThey cut across the slope of the valley, ending up nearly half a mile\naway at a spot where the ground had been leveled for sixteen beautiful,\npolished four-pound guns and their crews. A woman in her midfifties with\nshort, brown hair and a thin face strode among them, snapping orders and\ninspecting the guns. Her name was Colonel Silvia and she was the most\nexperienced artillery officer in the Adran Army.\nVlora’s approach was unnoticed until she was between two of the\ncannons. A crewman recognized her, snapping a salute and calling out\nattention. Within the minute, sixteen crews stood at attention beside their\nguns while their commander saluted, then warmly took Vlora’s hand.\n“Good to see you up and moving, General.”\n“Good to be up and moving. What’s the situation?”\nSilvia looked toward the town of Lower Blackguard. “Roughly four\nthousand metalheads holed up in and around the town. They have a\nperimeter, but it’s sloppy. We brought in a deserter less than an hour ago—I\nactually just came from a briefing.”\nVlora lifted her eyebrows. “Oh?”\n“Looks like this is the remnants of one of the brigades you and Two-shot\ngutted at the Crease. They don’t have Privileged or bone-eyes, and only a\nhandful of officers. About half of them are wounded.”\nVlora barely heard anything after the word “Crease.” This was what was\nleft of a brigade sent to execute her, murder her men, and take the portion of\ngodstone they’d brought from Yellow Creek. Flashes of the fight played\nacross her memory, and the ache of her missing sorcery made her weak in\nthe knees.\n“Do we know what they have planned?”"

Flashes of the fight played\nacross her memory, and the ache of her missing sorcery made her weak in\nthe knees.\n“Do we know what they have planned?”\n“The deserter said they have orders to hold for reinforcements. I imagine\nif we give them a proper encirclement, they’ll surrender by this time\ntomorrow.”\nSomething ugly reared its head inside Vlora at that moment. Her lip\ncurled involuntarily, and she couldn’t help but think of the doggedness with\nwhich the Dynize had pursued her, of the betrayals of the Fatrastans, of the\nlosses both personal and professional that she had suffered since the Dynize\narrived at Landfall.\n“Colonel, I want your battery to bombard the town into submission.”\nSilvia looked uncertain. “Shouldn’t we demand their surrender first?”\n“I think they’ll get the message.”\n“And civilians from the town?”\nFatrastans. Betrayers. Enemies. “Try not to hit too many of them,” Vlora\nsaid coldly. “Davd.”\n“Yes, ma’am?”\n“Get Norrine and Buden. Kill every officer you see. I won’t accept a\nsurrender from any officer with an equivalent rank of master sergeant or\nabove.”\nDavd swallowed hard. “Should we let them know that?”\n“As I said, they’ll get the message.” Vlora turned away, gesturing for\nthem to carry out their orders. That ugly thing was now rooted firmly in her\nbreast, and she felt like she was watching someone else order the butchering\nof an enemy brigade. She tried to dig her way out of this fresh-found fury—\nand was unsuccessful.\n“Where are you going, ma’am?” Silvia asked.\n“To find a good place from which to watch.”\nCHAPTER 4\nV\nlora spent the day watching the heavy bombardment of Lower\nBlackguard. Throughout the morning and afternoon, more gun crews\ntrickled in from the various brigades. They flattened sections of the hillside,\nbrought in their guns and artillery, and joined Colonel Silvia in the\nrelentless attack.\nWord must have spread that Vlora had emerged from her tent, because a\nsteady stream of messengers and well-wishing officers had cropped up by\nnoon. She listened to their platitudes and reports, taking them all in with the\nsame cool nod, and sat in her camp chair with her pitted sword across her\nlap. It felt good to let the sun play on her face after so long cooped up, and\nthe report of the guns gave her a feeling of warmth that bordered on\nfrightening.\nThe first white flag emerged from Lower Blackguard at about two in the\nafternoon. Vlora could tell by the lacquered breastplate that it was an\nofficer, and the woman didn’t make it halfway to Vlora’s lines before she\nfell to a gunshot from one of Vlora’s mages. The second white flag came\nout an hour later and met the same fate.\nJust after that second one died, Vlora spotted Nila picking her way\nthrough the camp. The Privileged approached the artillery battery, where\nshe spoke with Silvia and several of the gun crews, but did not add her\nsorcery to the bombardment.

Vlora watched her cautiously, wondering how\nlong it would take for Nila to approach and question her methods.\n“You’re shooting their messengers before they can surrender,” a voice\nnoted.\nVlora started and cursed under her breath. She’d been so focused on\nNila that she hadn’t heard Bo approach from behind. He had a collapsible\ncamp chair over one shoulder and unfolded it, plopping down beside Vlora\nand letting out a pleased sigh as he unhooked his false leg and began to\nfiddle with the ankle mechanism.\n“I swear that thing only makes noise when you want it to,” Vlora\naccused.\nBo smiled but didn’t look up from his leg. “You’re punishing them,” he\nsaid with a nod across the valley.\n“If you want to call it that, sure,” Vlora responded. She felt suddenly\nsurly, uninterested in listening to any sort of reproach from anyone—even\nthe adopted brother who’d helped save her life. She began preparing for an\nargument, cataloging Bo’s past atrocities, ready to accuse the Privileged of\ndoing anything and everything for his own ends.\nShe was surprised when he simply gave a small shrug. “Could be useful.\nBut is it a great idea to shoot messengers under a white flag?”\nShe opened her mouth, closed it, and felt that ugly anger stir in her belly.\n“They would do the same to me without hesitation.”\n“You’re certain of that?” Bo asked.\n“Yes.”\n“Ah.” Bo finally worked a bit of grit out of the ankle mechanism of his\nfalse leg and hooked it back to his knee. “Then, carry on!”\n“I’m glad you approve.”\nBo glanced across the valley, but he had that distant look in his eyes as if\nhe had already moved on to other, more important thoughts. Vlora tried to\nread anything deeper from his expression but was unsuccessful. She sighed\nand looked over her shoulder to where Davd sat on the hillside some ten\nfeet behind her—far enough to give her some room but close enough to\ncome quickly if needed. Davd was smoking a cigarette, and Vlora\nwondered when he had started. She opened her mouth to ask Bo if he’d\nseen Olem, only to remember that Olem was still gone. His absence caused\nher to ache as badly as did the rest of her body. She wished he had not left.\n“What’s the state of Fatrasta between here and Landfall?” Bo asked.\nVlora pulled her eyes away from the bombardment. “You mean you’ve\nbeen here for over a month and you don’t have your spy network in place? I\nassumed you’d know everything before I did.”\n“Don’t be silly. I know most things before you do, not everything. But\nyour soldiers are particularly loyal right now, what with their general\nsacrificing herself for their comrades and then rising from the ashes. It’s\nhard to get much out of them.”\nVlora snorted. “That’s reassuring.” She let her gaze linger on a group of\nAdran privates watching her from a distance of about twenty yards.

She tried to put them out of her mind and leaned\nforward in her chair, using her sword to scratch a bit of bare earth out of the\ngrassland and then drawing in it. “Here’s the coast,” she said, making a line.\n“Here’s us, and here’s Landfall.” They’d started out at the Crease, about\nthree hundred miles north of Landfall. The army had managed to cover\nroughly half of that distance while Vlora recuperated.\nShe stabbed another dot into the ground. “The Adran fleet is shadowing\nour flank, dealing with any Dynize ships so that nothing lands behind us\nand making sure we’re well supplied.”\n“And the enemy?” Bo asked.\n“Field armies here, here, and here,” Vlora answered. “All Dynize. The\nFatrastans have been beaten badly, but they’re not out of the fight. Rumor\nhas it they’ve got at least four hundred thousand men fielded down here.”\nShe drew a circle around the area to the northwest of Landfall. “Mostly\nconscripts. They’re better armed than the Dynize, but they don’t have the\ndiscipline or sorcery. Lindet’s a wily one, though, so I won’t count her beat\nuntil I see her head on a spike.”\n“Is that what you intend to do with her?” Bo asked.\nVlora’s stomach churned. “I’ll deal with her when I have to. Regardless,\nwe won’t know about the true state of the Fatrastan military until we get\naround the south end of the Ironhook Mountains. The Dynize field armies\nare our immediate problem, particularly…” She jabbed at one of the spots\nshe’d poked in the dirt. “That one there.” She drew a small horn in the dirt,\njutting out from the coast, on which was perched the city of New Adopest.\nHer last intelligence told her that the city was under siege by a Dynize\narmy. “We’ll lose valuable time if we go out of our way to confront them,\nbut if we don’t, we’ll leave forty thousand infantry at our rear.”\nBo gave the map a cursory glance and leaned back in his camp chair.\n“Hm.”\nIt took Vlora a moment to register how little interest he actually had in\nwhat she’d just explained, and another to realize why. “You already knew\nall that, didn’t you?”\n“You sound just like him, you know.”\n“Who?” she demanded.\nBo rummaged in his pockets until he produced his comically oversized\npipe and a match. He didn’t answer until he’d puffed it to life. “Tamas.”\nA little tickle went up Vlora’s spine. She snorted the thought away. “I\nsound like any competent general, you mean?” She gestured at the dirty\nmap. “You already knew all this.”\n“Of course.”\n“Then why the pit did you make me explain it?”\nBo smirked.\n“Well?”\n“Just making sure you still have it.”\nVlora was genuinely angry now.

Just because\nI’m practically an invalid doesn’t mean I can’t think anymore. I lost my\nsorcery, not my brain!” The last few words tumbled out far louder than\nshe’d meant them to, and she immediately looked around to see who could\nhave heard them. Only Davd was close enough, and he was studiously\nlooking elsewhere.\nShe knuckled her back, pulling at some half-healed muscle in her arm in\nthe process. Being angry, she decided, hurt like the pit. “Damn you,” she\nsaid to Bo.\nHe shrugged. “I handed an army to a woman who, for the last few\nweeks, couldn’t even move without help. I needed to be sure I didn’t make\na mistake.”\n“Thanks for the confidence,” she spat.\nBo’s eyes narrowed, and she saw his mask of indifference split\nmomentarily. “Don’t confuse my brotherly love for you for stupidity. I\nwouldn’t have handed you this army in the first place if I didn’t think you\nwould be able to lead it.”\n“Oh, stop it.” Vlora felt her anger wane. “This army was meant for\nTaniel. Don’t tell me you weren’t surprised to hear that he didn’t actually\nwant to lead it.”\nBo rolled his eyes and settled back in his chair, puffing steadily on his\npipe. The tobacco was pleasant, with a distinct cherry scent—not nearly as\nharsh as Olem’s cigarettes. Vlora pulled back into herself, nostrils full of\nsmoke, ears filled with the report of artillery, eye on Lower Blackguard, and\nwondered when Olem would return.\nA little after five o’clock, a lone soldier with a plain steel breastplate left\nthe Dynize camp, walking slowly with hands held in the air, shouting\nsomething that was lost beneath the din of the bombardment. He collapsed\nwhen he reached the Adran lines.\nA few minutes later, a messenger approached Vlora. The young woman\nsnapped a salute. “General Flint, ma’am, there’s a Dynize soldier here\noffering unconditional surrender.”\n“A common soldier?” Vlora asked.\n“Yes, ma’am. I was told your orders were to accept surrender only from\na sergeant or infantryman.”\nThat ugly thing writhing in her belly almost put words in her mouth, and\nVlora had to bite her tongue hard to resist the urge to order the\nbombardment to go on all night. “Right. I did. Tell Colonel Silvia to cease\nfire. Order the Third to march down and take possession of Lower\nBlackguard. I want a full report of the town and the Dynize prisoners by\nnightfall. Dismissed.”\nThe messenger had been gone for a few minutes before Bo cleared his\nthroat. “You almost continued the bombardment, didn’t you? I could see it\nin your eyes.”\n“Shut up,” Vlora snapped, getting to her feet.

The pain of making\nherself walk such a distance was dragging at her by the time she reached the\ncommand tent, and she had to straighten her shoulders and adjust her collar\nbefore she nodded to Davd to throw the tent flap open.\nAs she stepped inside, the chatter of discussion died within moments.\nAll eyes turned toward her. The big tent was full of officers and their aides\n—brigadier generals, colonels, majors. Most of them had already swung by\nearlier in the day to offer their platitudes, but they still seemed shocked to\nsee her here.\n“Good afternoon,” she said softly. She looked around to see if the\ncommander of the Third was present, and was glad when he wasn’t. She\nwanted him to oversee the surrender of the Dynize camp personally. “I\nknow many of you are waiting for orders,” she continued, “and that you’re\nall curious what we’re doing on foreign soil in the middle of a war that isn’t\nours.\n“Rumors may have reached you about the artifact of great power that the\nDynize possess and that the Fatrastans wish to steal back. The rumors are\ntrue. I have seen the artifact myself, and we are in possession of the\ncapstone of its counterpart. A third artifact is still unaccounted for.\nAccording to our intelligence, if the Dynize leader is able to possess all\nthree of these so-called godstones, he will have the sorcerous ability to\nmake himself or his emperor into a new god.\n“I will tell you right now: We are not here to win a war for either the\nDynize or the Fatrastans. We are here to take the Landfall godstone from\nour enemies and destroy it, after which we will withdraw and these sons of\nbitches can kill each other to their hearts’ content. Understood?”\nThere was a round of nods. One of the colonels in the back raised a\nhand. Vlora ignored it.\n“Thank you all for coming so far on the word—and krana—of Magus\nBorbador.” She allowed herself a smirk, and gave a moment for the few\nchuckles to die down. “Thank you for giving me the opportunity to lead you\nall in battle once again. The Dynize in Lower Blackguard have surrendered.\nWe’re finished here, and I’m simply waiting on my scouts before I plot our\nnext move. I’d like to review the troops in an hour, if you please. That is\nall.”\nVlora ignored a storm of questions as she cut through the middle of the\nroom and searched for a seat in the far corner, where she sank down in\nrelief and opened Tamas’s journal, reading with ears deaf to the rest of the\nworld. Only when a messenger approached, informing her that the troops\nwere assembled, did she close the journal and return to her feet, limping\nalong with the book tucked under her arm.\nShe stepped outside and her breath immediately caught in her throat.\nThe valley below the command tent was filled with soldiers standing at\nattention in perfect, still silence.

She couldn’t help but wonder what\nBo had promised these men and women to get them to come all the way\nacross the ocean and leap into a war, and whether her reputation had\nswayed any of them to come.\nShe dismissed the thought immediately. Bo must have promised them a\nfortune. He certainly had the money.\nDistantly, a voice called out, “Field Army, salute!”\nThere was booming answer of “Hut!” and the snap of forty thousand\narms. Vlora watched in awe, trying to remember if she’d ever been in\ncommand of so many troops at once.\n“Looks pretty good, doesn’t it?” Bo asked, emerging from behind the\ncommand tent.\nVlora managed a nod.\n“You know, technically you should be addressed as Field Marshal.”\nVlora considered it. She fought momentarily with her terrible\nsubconscious, which rather liked the sound of Field Marshal Flint.\n“‘General’ will do for now,” she told Bo. She stepped past him, walking the\nfew dozen paces to where the general staff stood assembled nearby. She\nwas barely able to tear her eyes off the army before her as she approached,\nand a line from Tamas’s journal struck her.\nWith an Adran Field Army, he’d written during the Gurlish Wars, if it\nwas stripped of buffoons and properly supplied, I could conquer the world.\nShe thought, for that moment, that she felt the thrill that must have\ncompelled him to such a conjecture. “My friends,” she finally said to the\ngeneral staff, “my voice is not up to a speech, but please pass on to your\nsoldiers that this is the finest army I’ve ever seen.” She lifted her head just\nas a rider crested the top of the hill. The rider paused, clearly taken by what\nhe saw, but Vlora lifted an arm and waved him closer.\nIt was one of her scouts. The man swung from his horse by the\ncommand tent and approached with a sort of reverence, saluting Vlora and\nthen the general staff. “What news?” Vlora asked. “Speak up so the\ngenerals can hear you.”\n“I come from the southeast,” the scout reported. “With word from New\nAdopest.”\n“And how does it look?”\n“They’re still under siege by the Dynize. They beg for aid from Lindet,\nbut none of the Fatrastan armies have been able to break north. The\nmessengers I met claim that the city won’t last out the week.”\nVlora glanced at the general staff, knowing what must be going through\ntheir heads. She’d already told them that they weren’t here to take sides, but\nFatrastans were almost entirely Kressian, with an enormous population of\nemigrated Adrans. Some of the general staff probably had friends or\nrelatives in New Adopest. It had, after all, been settled by their ancestors.\nVlora needed to teach a lesson—a lesson to her officers, to the\nFatrastans, and to the Dynize. She raised her voice. “Send orders to the\nfleet. They’re to brush aside the Dynize sea blockade, but I don’t want them\nto make contact with the city.”\n“And us?” one of the brigadier generals asked."

I don’t\nwant to reach Landfall with rusty troops. Let’s go give them some practice.”\nCHAPTER 5\nS\ntyke knelt in the thick, clinging underbrush, trying to ignore whatever\ncreature was crawling across the back of his neck, and watched as two\nsquads of Dynize naval infantry splashed through a streambed almost close\nenough for him to touch. The soldiers seemed alert, watchful, each of them\nlooking in a different direction to cover all approaches while the two leads\ntracked Styke’s Lancers across mud, water, and rock.\nHe pressed his back against one of the mighty stone outcroppings that\nrose sharply from the swamp. Not a sound—not a breath. He was too close.\nOne of the soldiers looked right past him, stabbing a short bayonet into the\nfoliage and missing Styke’s knee by inches. Satisfied, the woman moved\non. A few moments later the last soldier paused right beside Styke. He said\nsomething in Dynize that Styke couldn’t quite catch, then turned directly\ntoward him and began to undo his trousers.\nStyke was willing to put up with all sorts of creeping things for the sake\nof an ambush. He would not, however, allow a man to piss on him. He\ngrunted, knife flashing up, and slashed the man’s throat before he could say\na word. Styke lunged from the underbrush before his first victim had hit the\nground. He thrust into the next soldier, cut the throat of a third, and took\ntwo steps back before the rest of the squad could turn to face him.\n“Now!” he yelled, flinging himself back into the underbrush.\nFarther up the stream, twenty carbines fired at once, cutting through the\ntwo squads of infantry. Styke listened to the bullets whiz by and crack\nagainst the stone mere feet from his head, then counted to ten before he\nreturned to the open.\nOnly six members of the original two squads remained standing. The\nLancers fell upon them, swinging carbines and knives, but to their credit the\nDynize infantry did not go down without a fight. Wounded to a man, they\nclosed ranks and returned fire, then brandished their bayonets. Styke waited\nfor them to route and retreat toward him, but not a one of them did.\nWithin the minute they were overwhelmed, but at least four of Styke’s\nLancers had taken wounds, and two of those were on the ground. He joined\nthe group, taking a moment to wipe his blade on the jacket of a fallen\nDynize before barking out, “No time to slow down. We’ve got at least six\nmore squads on our heels. Jackal, get the horses. Sunin, see to the wounded.\nWe’ve got to stay ahead of these bastards or this swamp will be the last\nthing we see.”\nAs they jumped to follow his orders, Styke let out a piercing whistle.

Celine looked around at the bodies like a child\nunimpressed by a bunch of broken dolls, while Ka-poel’s study was far\ncooler, almost academic.\n“If one of these is still breathing,” Styke said, “I need him to talk. Can\nyou do that?”\nKa-poel’s hands flashed. Celine translated. I thought you don’t like my\nmethods.\n“I don’t. But I’d like to stay alive right now.”\nKa-poel rolled her eyes and headed around the sixteen-or-so fallen\nDynize. She checked three of them before finally squatting beside one, a\nman with the haggard old face of a seasoned veteran. The man’s mouth was\nfull of blood, his teeth clenched tightly, but he grinned defiantly at them as\nhe clutched a length of intestine falling from a gaping stomach wound. Ka-\npoel dipped her fingers in his blood, then dabbed them on his forehead and\ncheeks. The soldier’s eyes narrowed, then widened in realization, and he\nbegan to shiver violently, clawing at his own stomach as if to hurry his own\ndemise.\n“Seems like they know what a bone-eye is capable of,” Styke\ncommented. He looked over his shoulder to make sure that his orders were\nbeing carried out. The men had already begun to bring their horses back to\nthe streambed and out of the rocky recess where they’d been hidden.\nKa-poel pressed two fingers against the dying soldier’s throat. The\nman’s struggles weakened, his eyes glazing over. She nodded.\nStyke knelt beside him, looking over the soldier, the coppery scent of\nKa-poel’s sorcery in his nostrils. “Can you understand me?” He spoke in\nPalo, throwing in the few Dynize words he knew.\n“Yes,” the soldier responded.\n“Good. How many of you are on our tail?”\n“Nine squads.”\n“How many in a Dynize squad?”\n“Eight to ten.” The answers were mechanical, spoken in that Dynize that\nsounded so much like heavily accented Palo.\n“Your orders?”\n“Kill you. Capture a few. Find out why you’re dropping such a small\ngroup on the homeland.”\n“Is your ship continuing in pursuit of ours?”\n“Just the escorts. Our ship of the line will return to port to let them know\nabout a possible invasion.”\n“Of just twenty men?”\nThe soldier blinked blankly. “We are very cautious. The homeland is not\nwell defended right now.”\nStyke tried to think of any other questions that a common soldier might\nbe able to answer. That last bit was good news, but he knew better than to\ntake the man at his word. It was very unlikely that he actually knew how\nmany soldiers the Dynize had left to garrison their own cities. “Not well\ndefended”—could be relative, considering the size of the Dynize invasion\nforce.\nStill, this meant that someone would be told that Styke had put to shore.\nWhether the Dynize cared enough to come looking was another matter. But\nthey needed to hurry.\n“How far behind us are the rest of your comrades?”\nSweat poured down the soldier’s forehead. He was dying, and quickly.\nStyke wondered how long Ka-poel could keep him alive. “I don’t know. We"

The others may already be on your flank.”\n“Piss and shit.” Styke stood up, raising his head to the sky. “We need to\nfind that road well before nightfall,” he shouted. “Form a line and get ready\nto move out. I want to—”\nHe was cut off by the distant caw of a raven, followed by another, then a\nlong-drawn-out croak. He paused and looked around for Jackal. “Did you\nhear that?”\nJackal nodded in confusion. “That was Markus’s signal.”\n“That the enemy on our left flank has been taken care of,” Styke replied,\nnot bothering to hide his bafflement.\n“Yes.”\n“By himself?”\n“I’m not sure,” Jackal said. “Should I go find him?”\nStyke felt his gut twist. Something was wrong here and he couldn’t quite\nplace it. “We need to keep moving. If we’re fine on our left flank, it won’t\nhurt to get to the road. Markus can catch up with us. Get on your horses,”\nhe told Ka-poel and Celine. Once Celine’s back was turned, he knelt down\nnext to the soldier he’d been interrogating and quickly dispatched him.\n“Ben,” Jackal said.\n“What is it?” Styke’s eyes fell on Jackal, only to see that the Palo had\nfrozen in place, alert as a dog with its hackles up. Gripping his knife, Styke\nturned to follow his gaze.\nA pair of figures had appeared on a knoll to their right. One of them was\nZak, Markus’s brother. The other was familiar, and it made the hair on the\nback of Styke’s neck stand on end.\nIt was the dragonman who had walked out at the Battle of Starlight. Ji-\nOrz. He wore the same naval infantry uniform as the soldiers Styke had just\nambushed, and he regarded the entire group of Lancers with an air of\nappraisal. He and Zak descended the knoll, and though Zak was stiff, he\ndidn’t appear to be under any duress. He swallowed hard when they reached\nthe stream and cleared his throat. “Boss,” he said, “this man says he’s a\nbuddy of yours.”\nStyke met Ji-Orz’s gaze and slowly wicked the blood off his knife with\ntwo fingers. “Dragonman.”\n“Hello, Ben Styke,” Orz said in Adran. “I have come to make a deal.”\n“Hold on,” Styke cut him off. “First, how the pit did you get here?” He\nlooked sharply around at the gathered Lancers. He had no doubt that they\ncould deal with the dragonman—but it would be at great cost.\nOrz raised one eyebrow, his gaze sweeping casually—too casually—\nacross the Lancers, lingering for half a moment on Ka-poel. “How do you\nthink?”\n“You stowed away on the Seaward?” Zak blurted.\nThe dragonman glanced at Zak, his face expressionless. “Yes.”\n“Where?” Zak again.

        "text": "“You stowed away on the Seaward?” Zak blurted.\nThe dragonman glanced at Zak, his face expressionless. “Yes.”\n“Where?” Zak again. Styke thought to silence him, but he was curious,\ntoo. The Seaward was not a big ship.\n“Just under the prow. There was enough space to hang in the rigging out\nof sight. If the captain had ordered any work done on the keel on a slow\nday, I would have been discovered.”\n“You just hung there for two weeks?” Styke asked flatly. Styke had\nspent the better part of the journey carving and watched the gulls up on the\nforecastle. Orz had probably been less than a handful of paces away the\nentire time. The idea was disconcerting.\n“I snuck on board for food and water on two nights. But otherwise, yes.”\nOrz answered as if it was no great deed.\n“Through the storm?”\n“It was… unpleasant,” Orz answered. “Most of my clothes were torn\naway. I had to abandon my dragon leathers. That’s why I’m wearing these.”\nHe plucked at the ill-fitting Dynize uniform. “Does that satisfy your\ncuriosity? Or would you prefer to believe that I swam here?”\nStyke considered the question for a few moments. It had been over a\nmonth since Ji-Orz left the battle at Starlight. In theory, that was plenty of\ntime for him to slip down the coast, hop a Dynize vessel, and then put to\nland with the soldiers currently on their tail. But it would have to be a damn\nbig coincidence that Orz wound up on the same ship that would eventually\ngive chase to the Seaward. He shook his head. Either way gave him a\nstrange story. Either way he didn’t trust the dragonman. “All right.\nAssuming you hitched a ride with us… why?”\nA serious smile flickered across Orz’s face. “Because I needed to get\nhome.”\n“And you couldn’t just find a Dynize vessel?”\n“I left in the middle of a battle, disobeying direct orders from Ka-Sedial\nhimself. I am not… how do you say, a person ‘welcome’ among the\nDynize.”\n“Yet you’re going back.”\nA nod. “By now, my betrayal will be well known among the Dynize in\nFatrasta. Dragonmen will have been sent to look for me. Coming back here\nis the last thing Ka-Sedial will expect.”\nStyke studied Orz closely, trying to foresee where all of this was going.\n“But they’ll find out eventually.”\n“Yes, they will.” Somehow, Orz’s serious face grew even more tense.\n“Sedial knows he cannot punish me, so he will punish those close to me. He\nwill have dispatched agents to seek my family. I’ve returned to do what I\ncan to protect them from the coming reckoning.”\nStyke glanced to his side. Ka-poel stared hard at the dragonman, flicking\nher gaze once toward Styke but betraying nothing of her thoughts. “Is he\ntelling the truth?” Styke asked.\nKa-poel drew a pen knife from one pocket, then presented an open palm\ntoward Orz.

        "text": "telling the truth?” Styke asked.\nKa-poel drew a pen knife from one pocket, then presented an open palm\ntoward Orz. Orz’s eyes immediately narrowed. “No,” he said firmly. “I\nassume that you’re the one who broke Sedial’s hold on me. If that is true, I\nthank you. However, I will not allow a bone-eye to take my blood again,\nnot willingly.”\nKa-poel snorted. She gave a few short gestures and stepped back next to\nher horse. I think he’s telling the truth, Celine translated.\n“All right,” Styke said, breaking a sudden stillness. He realized his\nshoulders were tense, his fist clutching the hilt of his knife so hard that it\nhurt. He forced himself to relax and put his knife away. “We know why\nyou’re in Dynize. Now tell me why you’re here. What’s this proposition?\nAnd make it quick, because fifty or more of your countrymen are swarming\nthat swamp behind us, and I need to either get ahead of them or set up a\ntrap.”\n“Sixty-four,” Orz said softly.\n“Sixty-four what?” Styke found himself losing patience, and had to\nconsciously restrain himself from reaching for his knife.\n“Sixty-four of my countrymen. They won’t be a bother.”\nA shiver went up Styke’s spine. He jerked his head at Zak, who\nimmediately took off into the swamp to check on Orz’s claim. Orz\ncontinued, “My proposition is this: If you help me get home and get my\nrelatives to safety, I will help you make the rendezvous with the rest of your\ncavalry.”\n“Why do you think we need your help?”\n“Because you won’t make it twenty miles without me.” Orz paused for a\njust a moment, as if to let the information sink in, then continued, “I’ve\nbeen listening to your Lancers gossip for weeks. I listened at Starlight and I\nlistened on the ship. I know that you’re here to destroy the godstone, and I\nknow that you plan on meeting up with your Lancers and finding the stone\nin the middle of the swamp. As for the godstone: good. Dynize is better\nwithout Sedial getting his hands on such a weapon. As for your plan… it is\ninherently flawed.”\nThe surrounding Lancers began to murmur among themselves,\nexchanging glances and reaching for weapons. Styke could sense the swell\nof uncertainty within them, and it was not a feeling that would make this\njourney any easier. He half considered lashing out with his knife, silencing\nthe dragonman before he could sow any more doubt. But that, he decided,\nwould not end well. “How is our plan flawed?” Styke asked between\nclenched teeth. He looked once more at Ka-poel. Her head was cocked to\none side, as if she was listening very carefully to what the dragonman had\nto say.\nOrz didn’t seem to notice the stir his words caused. “Because you don’t\nhave updated maps of Dynize. No outsider has set foot on our shore and\nbeen allowed to depart again for over a hundred years, and that means you\nhave no idea how the Jagged Fens have changed since your map was made."

        "text": "been allowed to depart again for over a hundred years, and that means you\nhave no idea how the Jagged Fens have changed since your map was made.\nThe Fens are no longer a wilderness. They may seem it from the outside,\nyes; we’ve been very careful to keep our shoreline looking static to foreign\nsailors. But the Fens have been tamed. The godstone you seek is not sunk\ninto some swamp. It was rediscovered forty years ago and excavated. The\nscholars and sorcerers did not think it wise to move it, so instead we built a\ncity around it. We moved the entire capital. The godstone is now the\ncenterpiece of the emperor’s palace, less than sixty miles from where we\nstand. The road you wish to use is a heavily trafficked highway rather than\na backwater dirt track, and there are at least eight population centers\nbetween here and the capital.”\nStyke took a step back, feeling like he’d been punched. To pit with\nriding through the damned wilderness. If Orz was telling the truth, he was\nnow separated from both his army and their target by several cities and\nwhatever garrisons they might hold.\nOrz spread his hands. “May I see your map?”\nNumb, Styke gave a nod. Celine handed over the map case, and Styke\npassed it to the dragonman. Orz carefully drew out the regional map and\nunrolled it, giving it an appraising glance. “From what I overheard, you\nplanned on landing here, correct?” He pointed to the rendezvous.\n“Yes.” Styke briefly considered that he was giving vital intelligence to\nthe enemy. What if Orz snatched the maps and made a run for it, taking\nknowledge of the invasion back to his people? But Styke was still trying to\nprocess Orz’s claims, and he felt suddenly sapped of all energy to consider\nintrigue.\n“It’s a good place to land. Inhospitable, dense swampland. You’re lucky,\nbecause they’ll have some time to make preparations and scout before they\nare discovered.” Orz tapped another spot, roughly two-thirds of the way\ndown the coast between their current location and the rendezvous, and\nabout twenty miles inland. “This is the Dynize capital, home of the\ngodstone. It’s named Talunlica. To reach your rendezvous, you will have to\npass through or very close to Talunlica, and you will not be able to do so\nundetected.\n“As I said,” Orz continued, “I will exchange my help for yours. My\nparents live in the capital. They are the former heads of a Household and\nhave since stepped down. ‘Retired’ is your word, yes? If you help me get\nthem safely out of the city and into hiding, I will make sure you reach the\nrest of your army.”\nStyke had no idea how reaching Ibana and the rest of the Mad Lancers\nwas going to help. He’d brought twenty-five hundred cavalry over—enough\nto seize and secure an artifact in the middle of the swamp while they\nfigured out how to destroy it. But the Dynize had built an entire damn city\naround the thing. How was he going to meet up with Ibana, storm a city,\ncrush a garrison, and give Ka-poel time to unravel the damn thing’s secrets?"

        "text": "around the thing. How was he going to meet up with Ibana, storm a city,\ncrush a garrison, and give Ka-poel time to unravel the damn thing’s secrets?\nHe took a deep breath, letting the emotions roll over him, turning his\nuncertainty into focus. One thing at a time. “How do you propose getting\ntwenty foreign cavalry through the center of government in a place where\nforeigners aren’t allowed?”\nThat serious smile crossed Orz’s expression again. “Foreigners are not\ncompletely unknown in Dynize.”\nKa-poel gestured emphatically. Explain.\n“Shipwrecked sailors, foolish explorers, and the descendants of a\nhandful of merchant families that were allowed to remain in Dynize when\nthe borders closed. There is an entire”—he paused, searching for the word\n—“‘subculture,’ I think you’d say, surrounding foreigners. It would take far\ntoo long to explain, but the vast majority of them are slaves—the only legal\nslaves remaining in the empire.”\n“You want us to pose as slaves?” Styke demanded. He immediately\nenvisioned his time in the labor camps, chained together with convicts,\nforced to dig ditches for his evening gruel. He had to stifle a surge of fury in\nhis breast.\n“Yes, slaves,” Orz said, speaking quickly as several of the Lancers gave\nvoice to the same fears that had risen in Styke. “But I do not think ‘slave’\nhas the same meaning to you and me. In Dynize, a slave is a member of a\nHousehold. They do not get to choose their Household, but they do have\njobs, families, security. Many of them act as Household guards. Still slaves,\nyes, but treated well.”\nStyke relaxed somewhat, rolling his shoulders, and nodded for Orz to\ncontinue.\n“I am a dragonman. Very few people who see these tattoos dare to\nquestion my word. I can pass myself off as escorting twenty slaves and”—\nhe gestured to the armor strapped to Amrec’s saddle—“an acquisition of\nKressian armor from up north. We will pose as members of a Household\nthat has little to no presence in the capital. As long as we keep moving\nwithout hesitation or delay, there shouldn’t be any problems.” Orz spread\nhis arms, looking around at the assembled Lancers and once again allowing\nhis gaze to linger for a few seconds on Ka-poel.\nA niggle of urgency touched the back of Styke’s mind, and he glanced\ntoward the swamp, hoping to catch sight of either of his scouts. Those\ndamned Dynize soldiers might be on them at any moment, and he needed to\nset up an ambush or get moving. “We’re getting more out of this than you\nare,” he said. “Why?”\n“Because,” Orz said simply, “your plan will disrupt the local politics and\nmask the disappearance of my parents. And I don’t think you have any real\nchance of success. It is a fool’s errand, and I find myself drawn to it in the\nsame way I was drawn to spitting at the feet of an emperor I didn’t love\neven though I knew I would suffer the consequences.”\n“He thinks he’s giving charity to a bunch of simpletons,” someone said\nangrily from the back of the group.\nOrz held up one finger, a genuine smile cracking the corner of his"

I have seen Ben Styke kill several dragonmen in\nsingle combat. I have seen the carnage wrought by the Mad Lancers against\nthe very best Dynize cavalry. And I have seen her”—he pointed at Ka-poel\n—“break the strongest bone-eye in the world. You are the only group I can\npossibly imagine succeeding at this mission, and even if you all die in the\nattempt, you will cause Ka-Sedial many sleepless nights. That is enough for\nme.”\nStyke weighed his options. Was this a ruse? Or was everything Orz had\nsaid true? If so, did Styke have any other option beyond trusting him? He\nglanced at Ka-poel and considered demanding Orz give her his blood. But\nwhat if Orz was telling the truth, and the very request drove him away?\nThat would leave Styke and his men stranded in enemy territory with no\nway of reaching the rest of the Lancers.\nHis attention was drawn back to the swamp as a pair of figures sprinted\nout of the undergrowth and across a wide, shallow stream. It was Zak and\nMarkus. The pair were coated in swamp slime, faces dirty, eyes wide. They\npushed their way through the assembled Lancers, and Markus took a deep\nbreath, glancing fearfully at Orz, before nodding excitedly at Styke. “Uh,\nsir…”\n“Spit it out,” Styke ordered.\n“Ben, the landing party is dead.”\n“What do you mean, dead?”\n“Sixty-four of them. All dead. Looked like most of them were picked off\nin small groups, most of them without a chance of drawing their weapons.”\nHe glanced at Orz’s clothing. “One of them was naked.”\nStyke slowly turned to Orz. “You killed your own people.”\nOrz shrugged. “It wasn’t the first time. It won’t be the last. They were of\na Household that was my enemy during the war, so I feel no guilt. Besides,\nI thought it the only way to convince you of my intentions.”\nSixty-four men, slaughtered in what must have been less than an hour as\nthey were strung out through the swamp. Styke hadn’t heard a single\ngunshot in that time. He twirled his ring thoughtfully, pressing his thumb\nagainst the tip of the silver lance until it hurt. “What do you need to get us\npast Talunca?”\n“Talunlica,” Orz corrected. “Dynize colors, for a start. Passports.\nWeapons. Whatever we can’t get off the dead, we will acquire at the next\nlarge town. And I’ll need your men to stay completely silent for the next\nweek—we cannot risk anyone finding out they don’t speak Dynize.”\n“Right.” Styke glanced once more at Ka-poel. She gave him a small nod.\nHe wished that Ibana were here to hash this out with him. She was more\nlevel-headed about this sort of thing. “Backtrack, boys.

Got it?” There was a round of reluctant nods, and the Lancers\nbegan heading back the way they came, most of them giving Orz a reluctant\nglance as they passed.\nOrz snorted. “That might work in an emergency.”\n“Good. Because I damn well don’t trust you, but I know you’re telling\nthe truth about at least one thing.”\n“Oh?”\n“That this is a fool’s errand,” Styke said quietly, “and we’re probably all\ngoing to die.”\nCHAPTER 6\nY\nou’re sure about this?”\nThe question was, Michel knew, about three days too late. He stood in\nfront of Ichtracia in a hired room on the outskirts of Lower Landfall, where\ntheir Dynize passports had gotten them past the last of the major roadblocks\nthat governed all highways in and out of the city. The room was tiny and\ncramped, most of it taken up by a big, flea-ridden bed that usually slept six\nstrangers so that the boarding house could accommodate more bodies when\nthe dockside inns were full.\nWhat little space remained was occupied by a short wooden stool. On\nthe bed was a razor, a bowl containing a small amount of lime-and-ash\nmixture, and an actor’s face-painting kit. Ichtracia’s clothes—the black\nmourning vestments that she’d worn for almost a month—lay on the floor\nto be burned. Ichtracia sat straight-backed on the stool, like a princess\nsitting for a portrait.\nHer gaze flickered up to him briefly. “I said I was, didn’t I?”\n“You did.”\n“You question me a lot.” There was a note of warning in her voice.\nMichel clenched his jaw and tried to ignore it. “I do, because most\npeople only think they can become a spy. Actually doing it is a different\nmatter altogether.” Her forehead wrinkled, her mouth opened, and Michel\nheld up his hand to forestall an argument. “Yes, I know that you’d rather\njust smash your way back into Landfall and demand answers. But by your\nown admission you are loath to kill your own people—and even if you\nweren’t, Sedial is surrounded by dragonmen, bone-eyes, and Privileged.\nWe’re not going to smash anything. We’re doing this my way. Agreed?”\n“Agreed,” Ichtracia said after a long hesitation.\n“Good.”\n“I have a question first.”\nMichel paused, frowning at Ichtracia. “What’s that?”\n“Why didn’t you tell me about the sacrifices?”\n“Because…” Michel hesitated. Telling her that he hadn’t been sure if he\ncould trust her was not going to help their relationship. A half-truth, then.\n“Because I couldn’t confirm it, and I didn’t think you could, either. It was\njust something told to me by a dying Blackhat.”\nIchtracia stared at him for a few moments—long enough that he feared"

It was\njust something told to me by a dying Blackhat.”\nIchtracia stared at him for a few moments—long enough that he feared\nshe would question him further—before giving him a curt nod. “Go ahead.”\n“All right,” Michel said, trying not to sound relieved to move on.\n“Training. We’re going to move as quickly as we can, which to an outsider\nmight seem positively sluggish.”\n“How so?”\n“Spies don’t run. They saunter. Everything we do needs to be calculated\nbut look casual. We need to blend in, operate with thoughtful consideration.\nOur second job will be to make contact with Emerald and find out exactly\nwhat’s going on in the city—if he has any evidence of the blood sacrifices.\nOnce we’ve confirmed how, exactly, the Dynize are exploiting the Palo…\nWell, that’s when the fighting begins. We rally the Palo. We fire them up.”\nIchtracia cocked her head. “You skipped the first job.”\n“Our first job is to make you into a spy. It’s not going to be pretty.”\nMichel picked up the razor, took her long auburn hair in one hand, and\nbegan to cut. He talked as he worked.\n“We’ll start by changing your appearance. Your mannerisms will be\nnext. I don’t have time to teach you to act like a Palo, so I’ll have to correct\nyou as we go. Your Adran accent is excellent, which is a major boon to us.\nYour Palo… well, we’re going to have to work on that. We can pass you off\nas from a northern family with Adran connections and an Adran education.\nIt’s not too far-fetched.”\nHe worked the razor carefully around her ear. Locks of hair fell to the\nfloor, forming a skirt around the feet of the stool. He was careful to leave\nabout an inch on the top, half an inch on the sides—a common northern\nlook for city Palo women. The shade of her hair was fine, but he wanted to\nconvince both the Palo and Dynize that she was a native—that meant\nmaking her unrecognizable. The fact that most of the Dynize upper crust\nknew her face made this particularly difficult, so he’d need to lighten her\nhair with the lime and ash mixture.\n“We’ll need a name for you.”\n“I don’t know Palo names.”\n“I was thinking ‘Avenya’?”\nIchtracia repeated the name several times. “I like it.”\n“I had a great-aunt named Avenya,” Michel told her. “She helped raise\nme for a few years before she died. It’s not a common Palo name, but it’s\nknown.”\n“Avenya,” Ichtracia said out loud again. “Yes, that will do.”\n“Good.” Michel continued his instructions. “When you’re infiltrating a\ngroup, confidence is easily half the job. Talk, walk, and act like you belong.\nBe useful, engaging, charming. Avoid confrontation.”\n“Be like you,” Ichtracia said.\nTheir eyes met for a moment. She had made it very clear that despite\ntheir continued codependence and cohabitation, she had not forgiven him\nfor lying about who and what he was. “Yes. Like me.”\nShe nodded for him to continue."

Like me.”\nShe nodded for him to continue.\n“Because we don’t know who to trust, we’re going to approach the Palo\nunder our pseudonyms. We’re not their enemies, but if they discover our\nreal identities, they will think that we’re their enemies. So we, in our own\nminds, must consider them the target of deception. The Dynize probably\nhave hundreds, maybe thousands, of spies and informants in Greenfire\nDepths, and that makes it doubly difficult to decide who we can trust.”\n“Is there anyone?” Most people would have had a tinge of despair in\ntheir voices when asking such a question, but Ichtracia seemed to take it as\na matter of course.\n“To trust?” Michel asked. “There will be. Starting with Emerald.” He\nfinished with the razor and tossed it on the bed. “It’s a hack job, but I\ncouldn’t find scissors on short notice. I can tidy it up when we get to the\nDepths.”\n“You couldn’t find scissors, but you could find a face-painting kit?”\n“You’d be surprised at how many people have one on hand at all times,\neven in a Palo fishing village. Doesn’t matter where you are—people want\nto look nice for a day at the fair or to impress a loved one.” He picked up\nthe kit and rummaged through it until he found a bit of charcoal. He stepped\nback, looking closely at Ichtracia’s face. “Your features are distinctly\nDynize. Anyone with half a brain can tell by looking at you.”\n“You’re going to fix that with face paint?”\n“I’m not giving you rosy cheeks and a blue forehead,” he assured her.\n“I’ve met face painters—professionals who would never stoop to working a\nchildren’s street festival. The very best of them could make you look\nexactly like me.”\n“You’re joking.”\n“It wouldn’t last through a rainy day or a particularly sweaty afternoon,\nbut yes,” Michel said. “They’re damned artists, and I’m not going to do\nanything so severe. What I can do is apply a bit of shading to your nose and\ncheekbones. A little back here”—he brushed his fingertips across the nape\nof her neck, then over her brow—“and a little here. Very subtle alterations\nto the angles.”\n“And this isn’t immediately obvious to anyone who looks at me?”\n“I sure hope not,” Michel said, only half joking. “It should stand up to\nmost scrutiny, and it shouldn’t be so heavy that if you do get caught in the\nrain, anyone will really notice that much of a difference. They’ll just think\nsomething is a bit off, but pass it off as nothing. A person’s brain will trick\nthem in all sorts of ways if they think they already know who you are.”\nHe put one hand under her chin and tilted it up, examining her for\nseveral minutes before he finally lifted the bit of charcoal. Their eyes met\nbriefly, and he found her expression oddly determined. He’d already taken\nnote of the thrill she seemed to get when no one recognized her, and he\nwondered if this next step was just an extension of that.

No\nservants or free access to booze and mala. No comforts to which a high-\nranking Privileged might be accustomed. He’d tried to impress this upon\nher for days without any emotional response from her.\nHe considered something he’d been thinking about since they left\nLandfall with Sedial’s goons on their heels. He opened his mouth,\nreconsidered, then licked his lips several times before rushing ahead. “I\nhave a question for you.”\n“Yes?” One of her eyebrows flickered upward.\n“Why do you trust me?”\n“I don’t,” she said firmly.\n“Clearly you do,” he replied, somewhat more forcefully than he’d\nintended. “You followed me out of Landfall on my word, hid in a fishing\ntown for weeks with barely a complaint, and now you’re letting me change\nyour entire face and take you into one of the most dangerous places in\nFatrasta…”\n“Greenfire Depths is that bad?”\n“Yes, it is. And don’t change the subject.” Michel had momentum now,\nand he didn’t want to lose it. “Aside from wanting to see your sister, what\ncould possibly convince you to come with me?”\n“Are you trying to get me to say I’m in love with you?”\nThe question brought him up short. He froze like a panicked deer, mouth\nsuddenly dry. The idea hadn’t even occurred to him. He fumbled for an\nanswer.\n“Because I’m not,” she said calmly. “I’m not even sure I like you after\nall of this. But I suppose I do trust you. Back in the fishing village, when\nyou told me and Taniel that you planned on going back into Landfall to save\nyour people? That was the first time I’ve truly felt like I saw the real you. I\nthink I’ve found your true intentions, and that intrigues me.” She took a\ndeep breath. “And there’s the blood sacrifices.”\nThey hadn’t spoken about it since her outburst at the fishing village.\n“You think there’s truth in what je Tura told me?” Michel asked carefully.\n“You do.”\n“Yes, but I’m just a spy. I only have my suspicions. You’re a Dynize\nPrivileged.” She was evading the question. Michel fixed her with a look\nthat, he hoped, told her that he wasn’t going to let her get around it.\nSeveral moments passed. Finally, she said, “I do think there’s truth in it.\nSince I was a child, my grandfather has made it very clear that I am a tool.\nHis little Mara. Blood holds the key to unlocking the stones, and as a\nPrivileged and his granddaughter, my blood is stronger than most. But I’m\nnot there, so…”\n“Why didn’t you mention it before?”\n“Because it never occurred to me that he would turn to other options.\nStupid, I know. Sedial would never let my absence damage his plans.”\n“So you think he’s using the blood of others to unlock the stone?”\n“A lot of others,” Ichtracia said flatly.\n“How many?”\n“Thousands.”\nMichel shivered. “Pit.”\n“Exactly.” Ichtracia raised her chin imperiously. “I don’t much care"

I’m not here to fight for their freedom. But I can’t help but\nfeel as if the murder of all those people could have been avoided if I’d just\nvolunteered. I can’t let that pass.”\n“It’s not your fault, you know.”\n“I know,” she snapped. There were tears in the corners of her eyes, but\nshe wiped them away before they could fall. The gesture smudged the face\npaint Michel had just applied, and he made a mental note to fix it. “I’m not\na fool. But something has been twisting my guts around ever since you\nmentioned the sacrifices. I have to do something about it. You know, I want\nto meet my sister more than anything. To find out I have kin, and to find out\nthat she is fighting for something, rather than sitting in a mala haze. It\nshames me into action. I can meet her when this is all over.”\nMichel decided it would be prudent not to push her any further. He gave\nher a curt nod.\nShe wiped her eyes once more and suddenly smiled. “I do not like you,\nMichel, but I do enjoy you. Watching you work. I can’t help but be\nimpressed. You convinced an entire Dynize Household that you were a spy,\nand then convinced them that you’d changed your ways for good. And then\nI find that you hadn’t actually been a spy for the people we thought you\nwere a spy for in the first place. If I hadn’t been personally involved, I\nwould have found that very funny. I think it will be a pleasure to see what\nyou do next.”\n“Weirdly, that puts a lot of pressure on my shoulders,” Michel answered.\n“Good. You deserve it. Are you done already?” She gestured at her hair\nand face.\nHe shook away his thoughts and stepped back up to her. “We still need\nto dye your hair.”\n“Fine. Go on. Have I answered your question?”\nShe did trust him, but she didn’t like him. And they were still sharing a\nbed. An emotionally confusing answer. “Yes. Thank you.”\n“Then answer one for me: What do you plan on doing to hide your\nhand?”\nMichel swallowed hard. He’d been avoiding this subject for days, and it\nmade his stomach churn. “The same thing I do with the rest of my body:\nhide it in plain sight.”\nShe gave him a quizzical look.\n“That sorcerous surgery technique you used on me…”\n“If you want me to reattach your finger, we would need the finger in the\nfirst place.”\nMichel chuckled nervously. “That’s not quite what I had in mind.”\nCHAPTER 7\nM\nichel stood on the southern rim of Greenfire Depths, trying to ignore the\nterrible pain in his left hand.

Despite the very fresh feeling of losing his ring finger and\nhaving had the wound over the pinkie stub reopened, what remained of both\nfingers was expertly handled by precise applications of sorcery and bits\nfrom his face-painting kit.\nThe wound looked healed-over naturally, at least a year old, with no sign\nof bruising around the knuckle of either finger. It was, he decided, the worst\nthing he’d ever done to sink into a character. He hoped it was worth it. The\nDynize were looking for a man with the month-old scar of a single missing\nfinger—not the healed-over stubs of two.\nHe breathed in deeply, attempting to put the pain from his mind, and\ntook in the familiar smell of garbage, shit, piss, and sweat that rose from the\nDepths on the afternoon heat. The mixture of smells was joined by the stale\nodor of burned wood and garbage, residual from the fires set by rioters\nduring the siege of Landfall. He hadn’t returned to the Depths proper since\nwell before the invasion. Blackhats never went down there alone, and only\nseldom in force. Even for someone like him, who had friends scattered\nthroughout the cavernous slum, it would have meant taking his own life in\nhis hands.\nNow, masquerading as a full-blooded Palo, he should be fine to walk the\nwinding web of enclosed corridors that passed as streets—at least during\nthe day.\nShould be.\nThe idea of heading down there sent a flutter through his stomach.\nBeside him, Ichtracia stared into the Depths with a look of mild disgust. Her\npresence was a gamble. If they ran into real danger, she would resort to her\nsorcery without hesitation, and the moment that happened they would paint\na large red flag over their heads for the Privileged and bone-eyes in\nLandfall.\nShe’d taken well to her disguise. He’d thought that cutting her hair and\ngiving her softer features would lessen her imposing presence. If anything,\nit had increased it. Wearing loose workman’s trousers and a sharp vest over\na cotton button-down, her pale skin and confident demeanor told the story\nof a northern Palo businesswoman, someone who was more used to the\nconfines of factories or political buildings but with a history of giving\norders.\nAt least, he hoped that’s what other people saw when they looked at her.\nCreating a disguise to match an amateur could be extremely difficult.\n“People live down there?” Ichtracia asked, craning her neck to get a\nbetter view of the immense quarry as it wrapped around the nest of\npatchwork buildings below.\n“You’ve seen it before, haven’t you?” Michel asked in surprise.\n“Driven past it in a carriage,” she replied. “I never stopped to get a good\nlook.”\n“You don’t sound thrilled.”\n“I’m certain we have slums in Dynize. I have never seen them.”\nMichel opened his mouth, but Ichtracia cut him off. “If you ask me if\nI’m sure about this one more time, I’m going to toss you off the edge of this\ncliff. You just had me cut off your bloody finger for the sake of a disguise. I\nthink I can handle a slum and some dangerous Palo.”"

        "text": "cliff. You just had me cut off your bloody finger for the sake of a disguise. I\nthink I can handle a slum and some dangerous Palo.”\nHe snapped his jaw shut. “Understood. We have an appointment to keep.\nShall we?”\nThey descended by a narrow series of switchbacks carved into the wall\nof the quarry known as the Southern Ladder, steep enough that Michel’s\nshins hurt like the pit by the time they reached the bottom. The towering\nhive of buildings blocked out the sun and a good part of the midday heat,\nleaving the bottom of the Ladder cool, dark, and very damp. The smell of\nsoot was so strong down here that it gave him a headache, and he wondered\nhow the Palo continued existing in such a place.\nThe air felt closer, more oppressive, and Michel had to force himself to\nbreathe so as not to get overcome by claustrophobia. Ichtracia’s eyes\nnarrowed, her jaw tightened, but she did not comment on the stifling\natmosphere.\nMichel had worried that the slums would be abandoned from the fires,\nthat the bulk of the Palo population would have been conscripted for\nDynize labor or had fled the riots or had left of their own accord. But the\nbottom of the Ladder was as crowded as ever, people shouldering past\nthem. No one seemed to give either him or Ichtracia a second glance,\nthough within ten steps he had to wave off three different street vendors\ntrying to sell them unidentifiable meat, half-rotten vegetables, and used\nboots that had probably come off the corpse of an Adran mercenary.\nMichel headed into the interior at a measured pace, slipping into the\nrhythm of this place with almost startling ease, a hard, Don’t talk to me look\non his face, and with one shoulder forward to cut through the jostling crowd\nlike a knife. He paused every few moments to make sure Ichtracia was\nbehind him. It became instantly clear that she was not used to navigating\ncrowds; after all, she was used to people moving for her. Not the other way\naround. She was shoved and buffeted so badly that she was almost thrown\nto the grime-encrusted street.\nHe finally moved back to stand beside her when he spotted her reaching\nfor a pocket in anger. He took her by the hand. “Your gloves,” he\nwhispered, pulling her along, “they’re in your pockets?”\n“Yes.”\nHe swore silently to himself. “That’s a good way to get them stolen.”\n“I couldn’t leave them back in the room.”\nMichel pulled her into a recess where two disjointed buildings met and\ntook the bag off his shoulder. “Put them in here. My bag is less likely to get\nstolen off my shoulder than your pockets are to get picked.”\n“I want them at hand,” Ichtracia protested. Her tone was almost pleading\nrather than commanding. He could tell that she was feeling this place\nalready—learning why it was still a fetid slum even after a decade of effort\nby Lindet.\n“You have an extra pair tucked beneath the soles of your shoes, right?”\n“Yes, but…”\n“We can’t risk anyone snatching a glove off you and selling it to Sedial,”\nhe said in a low, urgent tone. “Would Sedial hesitate even a moment in"

She finally reached into her\npockets, pulling the gloves out in a wad, and stuffed them to the bottom of\nMichel’s pack. He said, “Next time we get some privacy, I’ll show you a\nlittle trick Taniel showed me that a friend of his uses to hide his gloves and\nkeep them at hand.”\nIchtracia nodded. She looked visibly ill, and Michel tried not to feel a\nlittle bit vindicated. This, he wanted to tell her, is what it feels like to be\npowerless like the rest of us. He wisely kept his mouth shut.\nAs they proceeded deeper into the interior, he noticed that more than just\nthe fires had changed Greenfire Depths. There was a glut of Dynize\npropaganda. Posters and handbills had been plastered to every wayward\nintersection of roads and hallways, proclaiming a better life for the Palo\nunder Dynize rule. A common motif was a printed drawing of two freckled\nhands clasped in friendship, and “DYNIZE AND PALO: COUSINS UNITED”\nwritten in big block letters in Palo, Adran, and Dynize.\nMichel stopped to examine one of the posters and found a tiny\ncheckmark hidden inside one of the freckles of the left hand of the drawing.\nHe pointed it out to Ichtracia. “I know the artist. He used to work as a\nBlackhat propagandist. The Dynize must have turned him.”\n“It’s easier to make friends than enemies,” Ichtracia said.\n“If only Lindet had learned that.” Michel bit off a further reply. He still\nonly half believed that the Dynize were sacrificing Palo. It was impossible\nto buy into it completely. All the newspapers and propaganda spoke of\nunification. The Palo seemed to be treated well enough. He struggled with\nthe thought of the changes he’d already noticed compared to what he had\nexpected. What had he expected? As much as the fires and propaganda had\nleft a mark, this was still Greenfire Depths.\nThey continued on until they reached a narrow strip of road where there\nwas stone beneath their feet and sky above their heads—a sliver of blue\nbetween two tall, dilapidated buildings. A view of the clear sky was a rarity\nin the Depths, and the road was flanked by shops crammed in as tightly as\nhumanly possible as well as dozens of dark entrances that led to mala dens,\nwhorehouses, gambling houses, and a thousand hidden crannies. The road\nwas packed to the point of barely being able to move, and Michel had to\ntake Ichtracia firmly by the arm and shove a path through.\nHe caught sight of a narrow doorway and cut across the crowd in that\ndirection. They reached the side of the road and gained purchase on a\ndoorstep, where Michel double-checked the sign above the door. It was a\npicture of a man in a baker’s hat sitting on a bench, pants down, above the\nwords THE SQUATTING MILLER. Ichtracia in tow, he stepped inside."

Ichtracia in tow, he stepped inside.\nThey descended a trio of steps into a cool, dank room lit dimly by gas\nlanterns. Despite the press of bodies outside, the room contained just a\nhandful of people. Michel stopped on the bottom step to allow his eyes to\nadjust to the low light, and quickly picked out a familiar figure in one\ncorner.\nEmerald sat with his back to the wall, one knee pulled up in front of him\non the bench, sipping from a pewter cup. His green-tinted glasses were\npushed up on his head, his stark-white skin and hair distinguishing him\nfrom the handful of Palo in the room. Michel zigzagged through the\nbenches and tables and dropped down across from him. “I’m surprised you\nwanted to meet in public. And in the Depths, no less.”\nEmerald tipped his head forward, his glasses falling onto the bridge of\nhis nose. “Kresimir,” he swore, squinting back and forth between them.\n“You two look nothing like yourselves.”\n“That’s the idea,” Michel replied as Ichtracia took up a position just\nbehind him, leaning against the wall.\n“It’s the Dynize,” Emerald said, a note of unease in his voice. “They’ve\nstarted sending their own people to work in the morgues. I’m still\ntechnically in charge, but I don’t trust the eyes and ears in my own territory\nnow. That’s why we’re meeting here.”\n“They like to have a grasp on all public services,” Ichtracia said, leaning\nover Michel’s shoulder. “I’m surprised it took them this long.”\nEmerald eyeballed Ichtracia. He’d made it very clear, when Michel had\nlimped to him just after the confrontation with Ka-Sedial, that he did not\ntrust her. He had obviously not changed his mind. “Yes, well, it’s going to\nmake my hobby a little harder. I’m known in the Depths. I help out at one\nof the Palo clinics from time to time. I’ve done enough favors for people\nthat I’m left alone—so yes, any meetings we have from now on will have to\nbe here.”\n“That’s a lot of favors,” Michel commented. “Being a spymaster is a\nhobby, now?”\n“Yes,” Emerald snapped. “And you should do well to remember it. If\nyou rely on me too much, you may arrive one day looking for help and find\nthat I’ve packed up and left for Brudania.”\nMichel ground his teeth. Emerald was right, of course. He’d been very\nforthright about the fact that he could only be so useful before putting\nhimself at risk. “Then let’s make this short. I need every update you can\ngive me.”\nEmerald looked skeptical. “What, you want troop movements? The\narrival of Dynize politicians?”\n“No, no,” Michel said, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “Sorry, I should\nnarrow that down.”\n“You should.”\n“We need to know about the Palo,” Ichtracia said.\n“What about them?” Emerald asked.\n“Rumors,” Michel said. “Public leanings. Events. Whatever has\nhappened since I left.”"

Whatever has\nhappened since I left.”\nEmerald grimaced. “Not much, to be honest. The riots died down while\nyou were still here. Aside from the fires during the initial Dynize attack, the\nPalo seem to be the least affected by the invasion. Some of them have left,\nof course. Others have moved into abandoned houses in Upper Landfall.\nEveryone else…” He gestured around them. “They’re just going about their\nbusiness.”\nMichel exchanged a worried glance with Ichtracia. “That’s it?”\n“You’re going to have to be more specific if you want more,” Emerald\nsaid with a hint of exasperation.\n“Disappearances,” Ichtracia suggested.\nMichel nodded. “Right. People going missing. Children, the elderly.\nPeople who won’t be missed.”\nEmerald considered the question for a moment. “Those kinds of people\nalways go missing during a war. You’re looking for something specific?”\n“We are, but I don’t think you should know. Not yet.”\n“Understood.” Emerald seemed to accept that bit of\ncompartmentalization without further comment. “Nothing in particular has\ncome to my attention, but I can look into it. Check morgue records. Ask\naround quietly. As I said, people disappear during times of conflict. But if\nthere’s something out of the ordinary, a pattern should emerge.” He\nfrowned. “The Dynize are recruiting Palo by the thousands, which is going\nto make the job harder.”\n“For what?”\n“Construction. Public works all over the city. A great big fortress down\nsouth, surrounding the godstone. They’ve even started a conscription\nprogram. If there are two hundred thousand Palo left in Landfall, roughly a\nfourth of those are being shuffled around by Dynize programs.”\nMichel had heard these rumors already, but he wanted to get Emerald’s\nopinion on them. “And you don’t find this suspicious?” Michel asked.\n“Not really. The Palo are being treated quite well. Very few complaints\ncome out of either the labor camps or the army reserves, though I suppose\nthe Dynize have control of what gets in and out.” Emerald nodded to\nhimself. “I can do some digging, but beyond that…” He spread his hands\nhelplessly.\nMichel swore to himself. He’d hoped that Emerald would be able to give\nhim some sort of evidence for or against these sacrifices. Instead he’d\npainted a picture of accepted enlistment and bureaucratic shuffling. If the\nDynize wanted to make a few thousand people disappear, they could do so\neasily in all that hubbub. “Do what you can, but be as circumspect as\npossible.”\n“That’s what I do best.”\nMichel looked over his shoulder at Ichtracia, who gave him a small\nshake of her head. No ideas there. He’d have to work on his own angle and\nhope that Emerald could come up with something. Frustrated, he mentally\nmoved on to the next thing on his checklist. “What is the mood of the Palo\nright now?

Do they support the occupation?”\n“You might as well ask if every Kressian worships Kresimir,” Emerald\nreplied blandly. “Everyone has their own thoughts on the Dynize. Like I\nsaid, the Palo are being treated pretty well. Fair pay, chance at rank in the\nmilitary, equal housing. Compared to Lindet’s regime, they’re living the\ndream.”\nThat was not what Michel wanted to hear. If the Palo were truly better\noff beneath the Dynize, it would force him to change his entire plan of\nattack. In fact, it might remove his plan of attack. How could he justify\nhelping Taniel against the invaders when the invaders were so much better\nthan the alternative? Then again, if the Dynize were plucking the young and\ninfirm and using them for blood sacrifices, he couldn’t think of a Palo he\nknew who’d find that an acceptable option for their future.\n“That’s not everyone, though?” he asked.\n“Of course not. I couldn’t even give you an estimate at what percentage\nof the populace supports the Dynize. It’s high, though.”\n“Do they have some sort of leader? Someone local who has the Dynize\nblessing?”\n“They do. Meln-Dun.”\nMichel snorted. That snake who manipulated Vlora Flint into capturing\nthe last Mama Palo? It made sense, though. He’d obviously sold out to the\nDynize a while ago, and he was in a position of leadership as the biggest\nemployer in the Depths. “Did Ka-poel appoint a new Mama Palo before she\nleft?”\n“She did,” Emerald replied. “Mama Palo is the other big political leader.\nShe hasn’t done a lot since the invasion—when Meln-Dun found out that\nhe’d missed his target, he was furious. He’s had a private little task force\nchasing her around for the last couple of months. She has to keep her head\ndown and stay on the move, and it’s losing her a lot of support.”\n“The Dynize aren’t hunting her?”\n“The Dynize don’t care. They’ve identified Meln-Dun as the leader of\nthe Landfall Palo and left all internal matters to him.”\n“As long as they think he’s bought and paid for,” Ichtracia spoke up,\n“they won’t worry about him or the Palo until after the end of the war.\nExternal threats first, then internal.”\nMichel leaned back, considering. “So we’re isolated here?”\n“Pretty much,” Emerald replied. “Besides their propagandists and some\nspies, the Dynize want nothing to do with the Depths while they’re still\nfighting a war on two fronts.”\nThe gears in Michel’s head began to turn, and he set aside the blood\nsacrifices for the moment to focus on the more immediate enemy: Meln-\nDun. The Dynize puppet would have to go. But Michel knew the Depths\nand he knew the Palo. Meln-Dun’s authority depended on his status as a\ncommunity leader and employer.\n“We could kill him,” Ichtracia suggested.\n“We’re spies, not assassins.”\n“You’re a spy,” she countered.\n“How do you plan on killing him without alerting your grandfather to\nour presence?”\nIchtracia’s lip curled, but she didn’t retort."

I’m going to avoid killing—or\nhaving them killed—as much as possible. I believe you understand that?”\nIchtracia gave a sullen nod.\n“Besides, killing Meln-Dun would only cause chaos. We don’t want\nchaos. We want to organize against a common enemy.” Michel thought\nfuriously, a plan beginning to form in the back of his head. He chuckled\nquietly to himself.\n“Is something funny?” Emerald asked.\n“Yes,” Michel said. “Yes, it is.”\n“What’s that?”\nMichel ignored the question. “That task force that Meln-Dun has\nchasing Mama Palo. Can you get me on it?”\n“Are you joking?”\n“Not at all.”\nEmerald scratched his chin. “I can make introductions through one of\nmy contacts. Do you have a good cover story?”\n“Leave that to me.” Michel tapped the table between them. “If I can join\nhis task force, I can steer their investigation and have a reason to creep\naround the quarry.”\n“What for?” Ichtracia asked.\n“So I can set up Meln-Dun.”\n“You want to discredit him?” she asked.\n“To the Dynize, yes.”\n“And to the Palo?” Emerald asked.\nMichel grinned. “We’re going to make that snake a Palo martyr.”\nCHAPTER 8\nB\ny the next morning, Styke and his small group had reached the Jagged\nFens highway. As they emerged from the wilderness, wearing looted,\nquickly mended uniforms and carrying the passports of Dynize naval\ninfantry, it quickly became obvious that Orz was, indeed, telling the truth.\nThe highway was a full-fledged cobble road packed with traffic. It\nwound through the swamp, lined with frequent farms, homesteads, inns,\nmail-relay stations, and campgrounds. They passed through a town big\nenough to have its own garrison within four miles, and stood aside and\nwatched as a platoon of fresh-faced recruits marched by, wearing shiny\nbreastplates that had never seen a scratch.\nStyke did not mind admitting that he was both shocked and impressed.\nThe Dynize had hidden behind their closed borders for a century now, but\naside from the odd story from a sailor or the curious newspaper column,\neveryone in Fatrasta had ignored their presence entirely. Not a soul\nsuspected that they’d built an entirely new capital just a short voyage from\nFatrastan shores.\nDuring that first day, Styke waited with clenched teeth for something to\ngo wrong or for Orz to betray them in some way. Everyone they passed on\ntheir journey certainly gave them long, curious looks, but the moment their\neyes fell upon Orz—riding bare-chested on one of Styke’s extra horses, his\nblack spiraling tattoos and proudly displayed bone knives signaling his\nstation to all—passersby would turn their attention to seemingly anything\nelse.\nIt didn’t take a perceptive man to realize that dragonmen had a\nreputation among their own people.\nOrz’s demeanor seemed to belie this casual fear that travelers exhibited"

        "text": "else.\nIt didn’t take a perceptive man to realize that dragonmen had a\nreputation among their own people.\nOrz’s demeanor seemed to belie this casual fear that travelers exhibited\ntoward him. He rode up and down the small column, lecturing Styke’s\nLancers on Dynize custom, home life, Households, politics, ways of\nthinking, and language. He switched at ease between Adran, Palo, and\nDynize, though he only used the latter when a stranger was within earshot.\nHe talked all day and into the night, his tone measured but friendly, his\nenergy up like a man who was glad to be back in human company.\nThey camped alongside the road without incident, and the next morning\nOrz began the day riding beside Styke at the head of the column. Styke\nhadn’t found a dead naval infantryman big enough to provide him with a\nuniform, so he had elected to wear his normal traveling clothes with a\nhastily made Household crest sewn to the left breast. Sunin had made the\ncrest at Orz’s instruction, and Orz assured Styke that the lopsided peregrine\nwould mark him as a Tetle Household guard to anyone who knew enough to\nask.\nThey rode in companionable silence for the first half hour of the journey,\nand Styke noted that Orz looked over his shoulder more than occasionally\nat Ka-poel. Styke could not sense any real fear, but there was no doubt that\nthe way Orz felt about bone-eyes was similar to the way normal folks\nseemed to feel about him.\n“You don’t like her riding behind you,” Styke commented after the fifth\nsuch glance.\nOrz started, as if he hadn’t even realized he was looking back at Ka-\npoel, and then gave a slight shake of his head. “Bone-eyes can’t be trusted,”\nhe said.\n“You’ll find no argument from me,” Styke replied. “I haven’t met your\nKa-Sedial in person, but he seems like a real piece of shit.”\nOrz did a quick scan of their surroundings. “Never say such words aloud\nin this country,” he rebuked, “no matter what language you speak them in.\nSedial has informants in every Household, including those belonging to his\nenemies. Even with him across the sea, his influence is such that you could\nbe executed just for insulting him.”\nStyke bit back a reply. People had tried to kill him for less, certainly, but\nthat was in Fatrasta, where he had friends and a reputation. If an entire city\ngarrison turned on him in an instant, he wouldn’t wager his luck in getting\noff this continent alive. “Right,” he finally answered, “I’ll keep that in\nmind.”\n“Besides,” Orz said in a low voice, “I’m speaking of every bone-eye.”\n“Her?” Styke turned and looked back at Ka-poel, who seemed engrossed\nin making one of her little wax dolls. “I’ll admit, I’m becoming fond of the\nlittle blood witch.”\n“Does she have your blood? Or any part of your body? A fingernail, or a\nbit of hair?”\n“Probably.”\n“Do you have any idea what she’s capable of?”\nOrz spoke in a measured tone, but Styke thought he sensed a hint of"

Did you happen to come across their\ncamp?”\nOrz stared at him.\n“There should have been two slaughters. The first was on the road, when\nwe ambushed them. The second was at their camp, where—”\n“I saw both,” Orz interrupted.\nStyke gave him a sidelong glance. “The second was all her. She took\ncontrol of most of the camp with her sorcery and interrogated the\ncommander. Once it was done, she turned them against each other until\nthere was no one left alive. She told me later that it took quite a lot of\npreparation to pull off, but… well, I’ve never seen anything like it.\nPrivileged could only dream of having that kind of direct power over\npeople.”\n“Pray that you do not see such a thing again.” Orz’s head began to turn,\nbut he seemed to catch himself at the last moment. His eyes narrowed.\n“Most of the camp, you say?” He let out a long, shaky breath. “Most bone-\neyes can only keep track of a single puppet at once. Some, a handful. I’ve\nheard rumors that Ka-Sedial has as many as a few dozen, though he can\nonly directly control one or two at a time. Hundreds, though?”\nStyke was surprised at the awe that leaked through in Orz’s tone. Was\nKa-poel really such an aberration? Was she really so wildly powerful that\nshe warranted a strong man’s fear? He checked himself on that last mental\nquestion and barked a laugh. Of course she was. Orz might have seen the\naftermath of that camp in the Hock. Styke had been there.\n“Is there something funny about the bone-eyes?” Orz asked.\n“No, I was thinking of something else.” Styke twirled his Lancer ring\nand watched a Dynize family pass by in a horse-drawn cart full of a type of\nunfamiliar fruit. “This civil war of yours… when did it end?”\n“Nine years ago.”\n“And before that, there were two emperors?”\nA nod.\n“What gave you such loyalty to yours?”\nOrz opened his mouth, paused, seemed to consider his words. “He was\nkind.”\n“Kind?” Styke couldn’t help the small laugh that escaped with the word.\nOrz didn’t seem to take offense. He simply nodded. “Not just in a\npersonal way. He was crowned when I was a child, when the civil war was\nat its bloodiest. My Household loyalties were on his side from the\nbeginning, of course, but he made it his life’s work to end the war. Not to\nwin it—just to end it.

He negotiated fiercely, without pride, simply working\nfor a way to end the bloodshed. He finally offered to give up his own\npower, and instead of putting him gently into retirement, Ka-Sedial\nengineered his assassination.”\n“Do you blame him?” Styke asked. “A retired emperor seems like a\nflashpoint for rebellion.”\nOrz snorted. “I understand the reasoning. But I had met him. I even\nguarded him for thirteen months, just after my training ended. He was a\nman of his word. He would have pulled out his own heart before allowing\nthe civil war to ignite again. I don’t care if Sedial’s reasoning was good or\nnot. I care that he and his false emperor slaughtered mine and then expected\nus to fall into line.”\n“Were you there when…” Styke let the question drop off.\n“He died? No. If I was present then, he’d either still be alive or I would\nhave died defending him.”\nStyke wondered about the man who could command such loyalty.\n“Where do the bone-eyes come into this?” he asked, resisting the urge to\nlook at Ka-poel. She had ridden a little closer as they spoke, and he had no\ndoubt she was listening in on the conversation.\n“Bone-eyes are supposed to be like Privileged or dragonmen—we are\ntools of the state. Wards of the emperor. At the beginning of the civil war,\nthe bone-eyes split nearly down the middle onto either side. As time went\nby, especially after Ka-Sedial came into power, more and more of them\nwere swayed under his leadership. They became a cabal unto themselves.\nThe few bone-eyes that remained on our side at the end were murdered with\ntheir emperor.”\n“So Ka-Sedial owns the bone-eyes?”\nOrz nodded.\n“And based on what I’ve seen her do”—Styke jerked a thumb over his\nshoulder—“that means that Sedial effectively runs the country.”\nAnother nod.\n“And most everyone is happy with this arrangement?” Styke tapped his\nring against his saddle horn, watching a platoon of young Dynize recruits\nmarch by on the highway.\n“Not at all,” Orz answered. “But they fear the bone-eyes. And they fear\na return to the bloodshed of the civil war. You have to understand, the war\nlasted decades. When Sedial assassinated our emperor, no one had the\nenergy to fight anymore. Peace was more important. Politicians on both\nsides were just eager to secure their positions in the new order of things.\nSedial offered complete amnesty to his enemies, and they took it.”\n“And then they let Sedial goad you into another war.”\nOrz swayed unhappily in his saddle. “It was a… what’s the word?\n‘Unifying.’ It was a unifying tactic. People were tired of the fighting, but\nit’s also what they knew best. Turning all that expertise and energy against\nan outside entity was the smartest thing Sedial’s ever done.” Orz passed a\nhand across his face. “Sedial is a man of limitless ambition. I fear what he\nwill do with all three godstones.”"

I fear what he\nwill do with all three godstones.”\n“That’s what I’m hoping to stop,” Styke offered.\nOrz gave him a cool look. “I fear what anyone would do with all three\ngodstones.”\n“Point taken.” Styke watched the side of Orz’s face for a moment,\nwondering if he would still have to fight him at some point in the future.\nEverything about the man, from his knives and tattoos to his posture,\nindicated violence. All except the way he spoke. Orz was as tired of the\nbloodshed as the rest of them. The idea seemed anathema to Styke.\nViolence had been his life’s work. He had never gotten sick of it. Even in\nthe labor camps, he’d just been taking a rest.\nWhat would it be like to leave it behind for good? Could he?\n“Were you planning on letting me live, back at Starlight?” he asked.\nOrz didn’t look at him. “No.”\nStyke remembered the fight well. He’d been badly wounded.\nCompletely tapped out, running on strength reserves that he wasn’t entirely\nsure were his own. Orz could have easily killed both him and Lindet. “You\ndidn’t have to answer that honestly.”\n“I would have killed you, because I wouldn’t have had a choice,” Orz\nreplied. “If I had shown an ounce of hesitation, Sedial would have taken\ncontrol of me. He would have raped my mind and used my body as one of\nhis puppets. I would have done anything to prevent that. But…” This time\nhe did look back at Ka-poel, speaking loudly enough to include her in the\nconversation. “I felt his hold upon me snap in those last few moments. I\nassume she did it when she got close enough to his other puppet—your old\ncompanion that he had in thrall. It was like a yoke lifting from my shoulders\nand with that”—Orz smiled—“I couldn’t help but spit at his feet like I’d\nspit at the feet of his emperor.” He nodded respectfully to Ka-poel and then\nturned forward. “That’s why I didn’t kill you.”\n“And that night at my mother’s grave?”\n“He wasn’t watching. Acting as the eyes of a bone-eye is like having\nsomeone standing over your shoulder. With practice, you can get a sense\nwhen they’re paying attention and when they’re not.” He cleared his throat,\nthen urged his horse a little faster. “Come, let me show you something.”\nStyke rode to follow, and when he’d caught up, he saw Orz pointing into\nthe bushes. “What is it?”\n“Nothing,” Orz replied. “I just didn’t want her to overhear us. I’m not\nsure if I could have killed you, Ben Styke. That bone-eye back there has her\nmark on you, and it is a damned powerful one.”\nStyke opened his mouth to reply that he’d asked Ka-poel that very\nquestion and she’d denied that she helped with anything more than a nudge.\nHe realized that she had no reason to tell the truth. “In what way?”\n“She is not controlling you. You’d know. But she is protecting you.”"

But she is protecting you.”\n“A little protection can be handy.”\n“But when does it end? When does she take control at a vital moment? A\nfriendly warning: Be wary.” Orz turned around and rejoined the small\ncolumn as it reached them, nodding once again to Ka-poel.\nStyke let them pass, watching his soldiers and eyeballing passing\nDynize. Slowly, he lifted one arm to his nose and gave a deep, powerful\nsniff. His Knack was not perfect, but he’d always been able to smell\nsorcery. There was, perhaps, the slightest hint of copper about himself. He\nsmelled it on Ka-poel and he smelled it on Orz.\nHow strong was Ka-poel’s hold on him? He thought back to all the\nbattles he’d fought since they first met—to the wounds that should have\nincapacitated him, to the exhaustion that should have left him on the\nground. He’d fought through all of it because that’s what he was used to—\nhe was, after all, Mad Ben Styke. But the legendary Mad Ben Styke had\nbeen a young man, unbroken by the labor camps. He was something else\nnow, and maybe there was wisdom in Orz’s warning. Maybe he wasn’t as\nstrong as he thought he was.\nThe thought gave him a moment of disquiet deep in his belly. Ally or\nnot, he did not like the idea of being enhanced by Ka-poel’s blood sorcery.\nCHAPTER 9\nM\nichel sat cross-legged on the floor of a rented tenement room deep in\nthe guts of Greenfire Depths, working by the dim light of a gas lantern. The\nlantern was fed by a shoddy-looking tube that jackknifed out of the ceiling,\ntouched the back of the lantern, and punched into the next room via a gap\nlarge enough for a cat to squeeze through. He could clearly hear talking and\nlaughing through the paper-thin walls, so when he himself talked, he made\nsure to keep his voice down.\nHe finished removing the stitches on one side of Ichtracia’s vest pocket,\nthen flipped the vest inside out. “Hand me your left glove,” he told her. She\nsat on the floor beside him, watching him work, and occasionally reading\naloud from a Palo book with an affected northern accent. Or at least what\nshe seemed to think was a northern accent.\nShe handed him the glove. “The Palo have been oppressed for hundreds\nof years,” she read. “Since the arrival of the Kressians, who have sought to\nsteal our land, break our spirits, and enslave our people.”\n“No, no,” Michel cut her off. “Longer ‘o’ sounds. Your accent is all over\nthe place. You’ve got to be consistent.”\nIchtracia’s eyes narrowed, but she repeated both sentences and\ncontinued reading until the end of the paragraph. “Better?”\n“A little. You’ll have to keep practicing if you want to hold an actual\nconversation with anyone from up north.”\n“Is that a risk?”\n“Enough of one that you should be ready.” Michel finished putting a\nhandful of stitches into the hem of her Privileged glove, attaching it to the"

She put one hand slowly into her\npocket. It took several tries, then with a quick yank she pulled her hand\nback out, loose threads hanging from the glove that was now on her hand.\nShe smirked. “That works better than I expected.” She lifted her hand and\ninspected the symbols on the back of the glove. “No damage that will\nprevent me from using my sorcery.”\n“Good. I’ll put it back in and do the other glove,” Michel said. “You’ll\nwant to practice this a few dozen times every night.”\n“Are you serious? It worked like a charm.”\n“The first time, yes,” Michel answered. “But maybe not the second or\nthird or tenth time. We want to make sure you’re comfortable enough with\nthe process that you can do it while someone is shooting or stabbing you.\nYou’ve seen a card trick before? Or watched someone twirl a knife?”\n“Yes.”\n“They had to practice that thousands of times before they got it right.\nThis is a trick, too. Not as complicated, but it could save our lives. I’ll redo\nthe stitches. You practice.”\nIchtracia snorted and handed the glove back to him, then the vest. “This\nsounds stupid, but now that I’ve seen such a simple trick, I’m shocked that\nevery Privileged doesn’t have spare gloves stitched into their clothes.”\n“Maybe they do?” Michel asked.\n“Perhaps. But most Privileged I’ve met wouldn’t stoop to such a trick.”\nMichel began restitching the glove into the vest. “Taniel’s friend—\nBorbador—is full of tricks. Or so Taniel tells me. Borbador was a street rat\nwho never quite took to the Privileged cabal. He wasn’t the strongest, or the\nsmartest, but he was by far the cleverest. From what I’ve been told, you’d\neither like him or hate his guts.”\nIchtracia sat back down beside him. “I’ll keep that in mind if I ever meet\nthe man.”\n“You might,” Michel said. “If that rumor of an Adran army up north is\ntrue, then there’s a chance Borbador is with them.” He checked his voice\nand glanced at the wall of their room, where the sound of laughter had\nwaned. He heard a grunt and a giggle, then chuckled himself. The\noccupants had gotten on to something else. He finished restitching the glove\nand had just turned his attention to the other pocket when he heard footsteps\nstop outside their door. The pause was brief, and a piece of paper was slid\nunder before the steps continued down the hall.\nIt was a note written in cypher. He read it aloud, quietly. “Meln-Dun is\nlooking for foot soldiers without links to the city to help him find Mama\nPalo. You have a meeting at three o’clock at the quarry. Contact name is"

Expendable.” He read it to himself several more times, then held it\nup to the flame of the gas lamp above his head. Within moments it was ash\nand a wisp of smoke. “Sounds like Emerald has gotten us a job,” he said.\n“Shouldn’t we make contact with this Mama Palo before we go work for\nthe enemy?”\n“If I knew where to find her, I would,” Michel replied. “But she’s to the\nwind.”\n“So you’re going to use Meln-Dun to find her?”\n“If the tool is there, I might as well use it. Are you ready?”\nIchtracia swallowed hard, then nodded.\n“Good. Practice your accent while I finish with the gloves. Then we’re\nheading to meet Emerald’s contact.”\nMichel and Ichtracia navigated the web of streets, paths, rickety bridges,\nand shortcuts that connected the tenements of Greenfire Depths. They\nheaded down to the river, then followed it upstream to the only corner of the\nmighty old quarry still producing rock for construction.\nThe working quarry was walled off from the rest of Greenfire Depths by\na high palisade fence, and Michel found the gate thrown open to the streets\nand a large crowd gathered. What looked like a foreman was speaking from\natop a large limestone column, flanked by thugs with truncheons. Michel\nshoved his way along the edges of the crowd, careful to keep one hand on\nIchtracia’s arm. They proceeded through the gate and worked their way to\none of the large wooden warehouses that were crowded into this corner of\nthe quarry floor.\nThe sun was directly overhead, peeking through the wide spot of open\nsky between the end of the Palo tenements and the walls of Greenfire\nDepths. Michel shaded his eyes as he reached the doors of the office\nbuilding, where he tipped his hat to a truncheon-wielding guard. He cleared\nhis throat, rolled his shoulders, and sank into his character.\n“We’re here about work,” he said, adopting a northern Palo accent. He\nassumed the body language of a confident man-about-town, with his\nshoulders relaxed, eyes half-lidded but watchful, and a polite but forceful\nnote in his voice.\nThe guard was a young woman with a smashed-up face pitted with old\nscars. She gestured with her truncheon. “So is everyone else. They’re only\nhiring thirty new workers to fill the Dynize orders, so best of luck with\nthat.”\n“No,” Michel said, “not that kind of work. I’ve got a meeting with\nDahre.”\nThe guard cocked an eyebrow. “Right. Head inside. Upstairs, first door\non the left.”\nMichel jerked his head for Ichtracia to follow. The inside opened out\ninto a wide, long room filled with the clank and scrape of stonemasons\ncarving blocks of a thousand different sizes while foremen organized sledge\nteams to haul the finished products down to the river.

An iron staircase took\nthem up the closest wall to where a series of large offices overlooked the\nworkspace, dangling precipitously from wooden girders. Michel strolled up\nto the first door and pounded on it, then slumped casually against the wall\nwhile he let his eyes travel across the big workroom.\nNothing seemed out of the ordinary. Stonemasons went about their work\nunder the watchful eye of the foremen, and there were a couple of\ntruncheon-wielding thugs, but the latter seemed more intent on watching the\ndoors than enforcing any sort of labor code. He did spot a single Dynize\nsoldier, dressed in morion helmet and breastplate, standing at attention on\nthe catwalk that stretched off from the offices.\n“Who is it?” a voice responded to his knocking.\n“Name’s Tellurin,” Michel responded. “Got a meeting with Dahre.”\nThere was a shuffle, the sound of a chair being pushed back. “I thought\nthere were supposed to be two of ya.” A bald head stuck out of the doorway.\n“Ah. There are two of ya.”\n“Tellurin and Avenya,” Michel introduced himself. “Got a\nrecommendation to come down and see ya about some work.”\n“You’re the thief-takers from Brannon Bay?” Dahre eyed them both up\nand down and seemed more impressed by Ichtracia than he did by Michel.\nDisguise or not, she had the unmistakable confidence of someone who\ncommanded respect.\nMichel stifled a smile at Dahre’s appreciative nod. “That’s us.”\n“Good, good.” Dahre stepped out of his office, closing the door behind\nhim, and shook both of their hands. He was tall, well over six feet, and\npaunchy around the middle from too much time behind a desk. He seemed\nthe jovial sort, not the kind of man Michel would want to stab in the back.\nMore was the pity. “Follow me, let’s go find the boss.”\nAs soon as his back was turned, Michel shared a glance with Ichtracia.\nHe hadn’t actually planned on meeting with Meln-Dun. A lieutenant,\ncertainly, but not the man himself. He must be more itchy to get rid of\nMama Palo than Michel had even expected. Dahre spoke over his shoulder\nas they zigzagged through a handful of offices and then took a catwalk that\nextended the length of the building and headed up toward a single office at\nthe far end. “What brings you down from Brannon Bay? Most people are\nleaving Landfall, not coming to it.”\n“No work,” Michel responded. “City is flooded with refugees,\nspeculation has hit every industry.”\n“I’d think that would be ripe for thief-takers.”\n“You’d think.” Michel injected a note of irritation into his voice. “But\neveryone wants someone found. Nobody wants to pay the price.”\n“Aye, aye.” Dahre laughed. “That’s the way of things. Believe it or not,\nthe Dynize have been pretty good to us.” Michel couldn’t tell whether\nDahre meant the Palo or Meln-Dun’s organization.

They’ve got work camps and\nfactories and they’re paying with anything you can imagine—ration cards,\njade, gold, and even Adran krana.”\nThey reached the end of the catwalk and Dahre stepped to one side,\nindicating that they should head up to the office. He continued, “Surprised\nyou came to us looking for work. Dynize are convinced the city is full of\nspies. Paying good money for anyone willing to help round up Kressians\nconnected to Lindet.”\nMichel made a noncommittal sound in the back of his throat. “Figured\nwe’d come to the city and work for someone we can trust before we put\nourselves in the employ of foreigners.”\n“Smart man.” Dahre rapped once on the office door. A sharp bark\nanswered, and he stepped past them and went inside, gesturing for them to\nfollow.\nMichel barely kept himself from blanching the moment the door opened.\nThe office was spacious, decorated in an old-world style of the Nine, with\nmusty carpets, low light, and dark wood-and-leather furnishings. But the\nfirst thing his eyes fell on was a woman sitting in one corner, arms crossed,\nthe black tattoos of a dragonman spiraling up her neck. She wore swamp\ndragon leathers and pared her nails casually with the end of a bone knife,\nher leg thrown over one arm of the chair.\nThe dragonman studied Michel’s face, then Ichtracia’s, and then her\ngaze fell back to her knife. Michel’s heart hammered in his chest and he\nprayed that Ichtracia hadn’t reacted to the sight of the woman. He raised\none eyebrow at the dragonman, as one might toward a curiosity, then turned\nto the man sitting behind a low ironwood desk.\nMeln-Dun was a Palo in his fifties, wearing a tailored Kressian suit with\nbig, ivory buttons and a turned-up collar. He sat straight-backed, a paper\nheld to his face like a man who was nearsighted but refused to wear\nspectacles. Dahre rounded the desk and whispered in Meln-Dun’s ear. The\nquarry boss gave Michel and Ichtracia the same weighing glance as Dahre,\nthen turned his head toward the dragonman. “Could you give us a moment?\nLocal business.”\nThe dragonman didn’t move. “Local business is Dynize business,” she\nanswered, her eyes remaining on the knife.\nMeln-Dun’s lips pursed. “Not that kind of local business. If you please.”\nMichel paid careful attention to the ticks of the short exchange, curious\nabout Meln-Dun’s relationship with the Dynize. He certainly seemed to\nthink he was in charge, but the dragonman didn’t jump at his bidding.\nInteresting. Slowly, almost carelessly, the dragonman got to her feet and\nstrode out the door, leaving it open behind her. Michel turned to watch her\ncross the catwalk, using the opportunity to lock eyes with Ichtracia. She\ngave the smallest shake of her head.\nNo recognition from either of them, it seemed.\n“You’re the thief-takers I was told about?” Meln-Dun said. He pulled a"

He pulled a\ncigarette out of one drawer of his desk, lit it, but didn’t offer any to Michel\nand Ichtracia. “I’m glad to hear we found you before the Dynize did.” His\neyes dropped to the missing fingers on Michel’s hand, briefly, before\nreturning to his face. “Dahre here has been chasing a problem all around the\nDepths for a couple months now without any real progress. I’m hoping you\ncan change that.”\n“I hope so, too.” Michel took his hat off, nodding to Meln-Dun before\ndropping into the dragonman’s still-warm seat. It was an affected mix of\npoliteness and confidence that had always gotten him far in infiltrations. “If\nyou need people found, we’re the ones to do it.” Ichtracia leaned against the\ndoor, and Michel caught Dahre eyeballing her body for a moment before he\nwent to the one tiny window and squinted outside.\nMeln-Dun took several drags on his cigarette. His fingers trembled ever\nso slightly, and Michel wondered just how much of his soul he’d had to sell\nto the Dynize to become the de facto king of Greenfire Depths. “I’m\ncurious how you propose to find anything in Greenfire Depths if you’re\nfrom Brannon Bay. This place is, as you may have already noticed, unique.”\n“I’m from here,” Michel said with a derisive snort. “Parents died when I\nwas a boy. Ran the streets for a few years until an uncle up in Brannon Bay\ncame and found me and gave me a trade. I agree that coming in blind would\nbe foolish, but me? Well, I know the place. And Avenya here learns quick.”\n“Do you still have local ties?” Meln-Dun asked, almost too quickly.\n“Like I said, street kid,” Michel answered. “If I have any local ties, I\nhaven’t talked to them since before the Revolution.”\n“Excellent. We need trackers, but we’re more in need of eyes and ears\nwithout the preestablished… loyalties of the Depths. We need a woman\nfound—a local folk hero of sorts. Goes by the name of Mama Palo.”\n“Heard the name,” Michel said, digging in one ear with his remaining\npinkie as if he wasn’t at all concerned by the person in question. “Freedom\nfighter, right?”\n“That’s right.”\nMichel spat on the wood floor. “I’ve dealt with their type before. Idealist\npricks, the lot of ’em.”\nA small smile grew behind Meln-Dun’s cigarette. “I think I like you,\nMr.…”\n“Tellurin.”\n“I like you, Mr. Tellurin. You and your friend are hired. Discuss the\nterms with Dahre. He’s heading up the search and already has some boys\nworking their way through this godforsaken rat’s nest.”\n“I can have you join up with them tomorrow,” Dahre added, nodding\nalong with his boss.\nMichel got up, cocking his head and straightening his shirt. “Thank ya,\nright, sir.

Truncheon and ankles dragged in the dirt?”\n“Dead,” Meln-Dun said mirthlessly, face hardening. “I want her and all\nher followers slaughtered. Will that be a problem?”\n“The knife, then,” Michel said, pulling a face. “Price will be a little\nhigher, especially if she’s as popular as you say and we have to disappear\nquick after the job.”\n“Price isn’t an issue.”\n“Then we have a deal.” Michel returned his hat to his head and touched\nthe brim. “Right you are. Sir?” he said to Dahre.\nDahre led them out of the office and back along the catwalk. Michel\nlagged behind a little bit, glancing over his shoulder at Ichtracia as they\npassed the waiting dragonman. Once they had left her far behind and were\nback among the rest of the offices, he waited for Dahre to get far ahead of\nthem and quietly asked, “That dragonman. Anyone you know?”\n“Don’t think so. There are a lot of dragonmen. Don’t think she\nrecognized me, either.”\n“Didn’t look like it. But keep your eyes open.”\n“Meln-Dun doesn’t want the Dynize to know that he’s having problems\nwith Mama Palo,” Ichtracia said.\nMichel resisted the urge to scratch at the painful stubs of his two fingers.\n“I got the same impression. We’ll have to figure out how to use that.”\n“They seem awfully trusting,” she said cautiously as they approached\nDahre’s office. She wasn’t outwardly nervous, but her eyes moved just a\nlittle too quickly, like someone trying to watch every angle at once.\n“This isn’t high politics,” Michel answered quickly. They would have\ntime to talk later, but anything he could do to calm Ichtracia’s nerves would\nhelp her stay in disguise better. “Down here, among the Palo, you get jobs\non a handshake, a nod, and knowing a guy who knows a guy. People pass\nthrough all the time. If they screened them all they’d never do anything\nelse.”\n“That sounds… distractingly easy.”\n“That’s not the hard part,” Michel responded. “The hard part will be\nshaking these assholes off our trail once we’re ready to move on.”\nCHAPTER 10\nT\nhe Adran Army marched down the coast for four days and swung around\nonto the Cape of New Adopest, where they descended from the hilly\nnorthland and onto a vast river delta that had long been stripped of its old\nforests. Cotton and tobacco plantations stretched to the horizon, broken\nonly by the intertwining branches of the New Ad River.\nVlora sat on her horse, watching from a knoll beside an abandoned\nplantation house as her army marched over the first of a dozen bridges that\nstood between her and New Adopest. The distance wasn’t far—another\ntwelve miles or so—but she fully expected it to be a hard-fought twelve\nmiles, with burned bridges and a dug-in enemy waiting for them at the end.\nSoldiers saluted her position as they passed, and Vlora returned the"

She blinked sweat out of her\neyes. “When did you get here? Where’s Davd?”\n“Just relieved him, ma’am,” Norrine responded, pointing to where Davd\nwas riding down to join the army on the road. “Do you want me to get\nhim?”\n“No,” Vlora answered, hearing the response come too quickly from her\nlips. “No, that’s okay. I just…” She hesitated for a few moments, before\ncontinuing in a quiet voice, “There are gaps in my memory from the\nCrease.”\n“Perfectly normal, ma’am. You almost died.”\nVlora opened her mouth, frustrated at not being able to voice her\nfrustration. “I know, I know. I’m just worried that the gaps are widening.\nThat they’re happening to me still. Do you understand? I keep looking\naround for Olem, even though you and Davd and Bo have told me a dozen\ntimes that he’s on an errand.”\nNorrine looked down at her rifle, which was slung across her saddle\nhorn, then looked on toward the horizon without answering. Perhaps there\nwas no answer. Vlora gestured dismissively. “Sorry, it’s not your problem.”\n“It is my problem, ma’am,” Norrine responded slowly. “You’re my\ncommanding officer. But I’m not great on advice. Better at shooting and\nfighting.”\n“Me too, Norrine.”\n“They say time heals all wounds. You probably just need time.”\n“I don’t have any.”\nThey fell into an uncomfortable silence, and Vlora was relieved when\nshe spotted Bo and Nila making their way from the column up toward her\nposition. They approached, turning their horses to fall in on her opposite\nside from Norrine. Bo scratched his head, jerking his chin toward the\nhorizon in the direction of New Adopest. “Does something feel off about\nthis?”\nIt took a moment for Vlora to retool her thoughts and focus on the\nstrategies she’d need to employ for the next few days. She’d felt a vague\nunease since this morning, but she’d just chalked it up to the fear she felt\nover gaps in her memory. She swept her gaze across the horizon, finding\nnothing worrisome, and turned to Bo. “I’m not sure what you mean.”\n“I’m not, either,” Bo said. “You’re the trained strategist. I just feel\nlike…” He chewed on the inside of his cheek.\nIt was Nila who spoke up. “Why is that bridge still there?”\nThe question set off a spark in Vlora’s mind, and that feeling of unease\ngrew stronger. Bo was right. Something was wrong. She met Nila’s eyes.\n“They have to know we’re coming.”\n“Absolutely,” Nila answered. “We have an entire field army. They\nshould have known we were coming weeks ago and made preparations."

        "text": "“They have to know we’re coming.”\n“Absolutely,” Nila answered. “We have an entire field army. They\nshould have known we were coming weeks ago and made preparations.\nAnd even if somehow they missed us, our fleet will have already engaged\ntheirs. They know we’re here. They know about our approach.”\n“I don’t follow,” Bo said.\nVlora snorted. For as brilliant as Bo was, he could be daft as pit at times.\n“There’s a Dynize field army between us and New Adopest, correct?”\n“Yes.”\n“If you knew that an enemy was on the way to relieve the city, wouldn’t\nyou have burned all the bridges between you and them?”\nBo opened his mouth in a silent “ah-ha.”\n“We’re not far,” Vlora continued. “We’ll be approaching their rear by\nthe end of the day. So why aren’t they trying to slow us down? Where is\ntheir delaying action?”\n“Maybe their general is an idiot?” Bo suggested.\n“Maybe.” Vlora looked to the south, where the main trunk of the New\nAd River slashed the Cape in two horizontally on the map. It was a wide,\ndeep river and their destination was on the north bank—so she’d kept her\narmy on the same side. But now something about its positioning bothered\nher. “Could this be a trap?”\n“In what way?” Nila asked.\nVlora shook her head. “Perhaps they’re trying to lead us out onto the\nCape and then bottle us out here with a bigger army?”\n“That’s a terrible trap,” Bo pointed out. “We have an enormous fleet\nright off the coast. All we’d have to do is embark and land somewhere north\nor south of the Cape.”\n“It would slow us down by a week or two,” Vlora reasoned. “Enough\ntime for them to get reinforcements.”\n“Are we reading too much into this?” Nila asked. “It could very well\njust be enemy complacence, or stupidity, or…” She trailed off with a shrug.\n“Put it to your generals. Or leave a brigade or two back here.”\nThe temptation to divide her forces was strong, but Vlora fought against\nit. Splitting the army now, with several field armies still south of them on\nthe mainland, could just play into the enemy’s hands. This excursion to\nNew Adopest was supposed to be a brief one, meant to isolate and break a\nportion of the enemy’s strength. “We stay as one.” She raised her hand,\nsignaling for one of the half-dozen messengers awaiting her word down by\nthe road. A boy in a loose-fitting uniform, probably no more than fifteen,\nrode up the hill and snapped a salute.\n“Orders for General Sabastenien,” Vlora said. “I want him to send his\ncavalry across the New Ad, where they’ll shadow our movement, scout the\nsouth side of the river, and report back at regular intervals. Dismissed.” The\nmessenger was off before she’d finished the last word, and she watched the\nboy go with a frown. “I do feel like I’m missing something,” she said.\n“You have scouts ahead of the vanguard?” Nila asked.\n“Of course.” Vlora stewed in her uncertainty. “If they haven’t burned"

        "text": "“You have scouts ahead of the vanguard?” Nila asked.\n“Of course.” Vlora stewed in her uncertainty. “If they haven’t burned\nany of the bridges, we’ll be within scouting range of the enemy siege by\nnightfall. We’ll find out what’s waiting for us then.”\nThe enemy, as it turned out, had only burned one bridge. It was the bridge\nbetween one of the smaller tributaries of the New Ad and the Dynize camp.\nThe river was shallow enough to ford but deep enough to slow their\ncrossing if the enemy decided to make a contest of it. And based on their\ndefenses, they would make it a contest.\nThe Dynize army had formed a half-moon series of fortifications around\nthe distant city of New Adopest with ditches, gun emplacements, and\nwatchtowers. But they’d also done the same thing on the other side, facing\noutward, effectively turning their besieging army into a town capable of\nwithstanding siege itself. The closest of the earthworks was placed just fifty\nyards beyond the river. Vlora could see, through her looking glass, the\nmorion-helmed soldiers manning those earthworks and gun crews checking\nover the artillery that would face her were she to attempt a direct assault.\n“They definitely knew we were coming,” Vlora said to no one in\nparticular. She was surrounded by most of her general staff, all on\nhorseback, and all examining the enemy and the city beyond them through\ntheir looking glasses.\n“We can brush those aside with sorcery,” someone suggested. Vlora\ndidn’t bother lowering her looking glass to see who.\n“No, we can’t,” Nila shot back. “They have at least eight Privileged over\nthere. I’m strong, but with just me and Bo we’ll have our hands full\nhandling that many at once.”\n“Davd?” Vlora asked.\nHer powder mage hesitated for a moment before answering. “Those\nPrivileged are hanging really damn far back. Almost to the front they have\nwith New Adopest. If I didn’t know any better, I’d think that they’ve\nlearned not to get cocky around powder mages.”\n“So they have strong positioning, and they’re being smart,” Vlora said.\n“That’s unfortunate.” She fought a spike of frustration. All of this would be\nso much easier with her own sorcery—she wouldn’t have to ask for reports\non the enemy Privileged or use a looking glass to see the earthworks.\n“It’s nothing we can’t take,” General Frylo said. He was an older man, a\nveteran of the army that Tamas built before the Adran-Kez War, and newly\narrived with Bo and Nila. “But we’ll lose a lot of men doing it unless we\ncan come up with something clever.”\nVlora swept her looking glass across the enemy fortifications, through\nthe middle of their camp, and then to the buildings of New Adopest barely\nvisible through the afternoon haze. There wasn’t a lot of high ground out\nhere, so visibility was no more than a few miles, and even that was sketchy.\nThe enemy could be doing practically anything behind those fortifications\nand she’d be none the wiser. She swung her looking glass to the river,\nwhere a few hundred Dynize cavalry were fording the river toward a token\nforce holding south of the city."

She swung her looking glass to the river,\nwhere a few hundred Dynize cavalry were fording the river toward a token\nforce holding south of the city.\n“General Sabastenien, do we have word back from those scouts we sent\nacross the river?”\nSabastenien shook his head. He was not much older than Vlora, in his\nmid-to-late thirties. He’d been a brigadier with the Wings of Adom\nmercenary company during the Adran-Kez War and then recruited to the\nregular army by Tamas. “They ran into resistance the moment they crossed.\nDynize cavalry are screening us, keeping us from getting a foothold over\nthere.”\n“How many did you send?”\n“Two hundred dragoons, with orders not to engage.”\n“Send four hundred. I want to know what’s going on to our south, and I\nwant to know by tomorrow afternoon.”\n“Yes, ma’am.”\nVlora considered the order, wondering if she should send more. The\nenemy might be contesting their scouts for some vital reason, or just to foul\nVlora’s intelligence. She needed to know either way. But at what cost?\n“Make it five hundred,” she corrected. “And give their commanding officer\ndiscretion on whether to engage.”\n“Of course, ma’am. Right away.”\nVlora turned her looking glass back on the enemy camp and listened for\nthe distant report of cannon fire. If the Dynize had been shelling New\nAdopest before she arrived, they had stopped now. Perhaps they thought\ntheir guns would be better turned in her direction? They wouldn’t be wrong,\nof course.\n“Do you see that?” someone asked.\n“What?” Vlora asked, lowering her looking glass for a moment and\nsweeping the horizon.\n“There.” It was Sabastenien speaking. “One o’clock. From their camp.”\nVlora followed his instructions and used her looking glass to find a pair\nof Dynize riders coming over the earthworks. They forded the tributary and\nbegan the long trek toward the Adran lines, waving a white flag. Neither\nsoldier wore a breastplate nor any decoration.\n“Deserters or messengers?” Bo asked.\n“Messengers, by the white flags,” Nila responded.\nVlora could hear a very pregnant question in the air. The entire general\nstaff had an air of expectation, and she could practically feel Bo wanting to\nask if she was going to give the orders to shoot them. The terrible urge in\nher stomach certainly wanted her to. But these weren’t the soldiers that had\nalmost killed her. She had to remain in control of herself. She lowered her\nlooking glass and took her reins in one hand, then headed at a slow pace out\nto meet them. “Bo, Davd,” she called over her shoulder. “With me.”\nShe drew up a few hundred yards in front of her own lines and waited\nfor the messengers to reach her. One was a middle-aged man with short-cut\nhair, thoughtful eyes, and a clean-shaven face. The other was an older\nwoman—very old, looking just on the edge of frail.

        "text": "woman—very old, looking just on the edge of frail. Her hair was dyed as\nblack as Vlora’s and she had deep smile lines on her cheeks. It was the man\nwho spoke, in broken Adran. “We’re looking for General Flint.”\n“You’ve found General Flint,” Vlora replied. “What do you want?”\n“We’re here on behalf of General Etepali of the Spider Brigades of the\nEmperor’s Immortal Army.”\n“On what errand?”\n“To seek an audience with General Flint.”\nVlora examined the two, unable to keep her lip from curling. They were\ntoo sharp-eyed, too clean and well-mannered to be common soldiers and yet\nthey weren’t wearing anything that marked them as officers. She wondered\nif word from Lower Blackguard had spread ahead of her. She remembered\nmeeting with the Dynize general just before the Battle of Windy River. Her\nhead had been nothing but a trophy to him. Arrogant prick.\n“Why should I agree to meet with your general?”\n“Mutual respect,” the old woman said, spreading her hands wide.\n“I’ve yet to meet any of your officers who looked at me as any more\nthan a rabid dog waiting to be put down.”\nThe pair of messengers exchanged a glance, something passing between\nthem. The man replied, “Mistakes were made.”\n“I’ve splattered your mistakes across the hills of Fatrasta.”\n“A good reason to talk to you rather than fight you, no?” the old woman\nasked. Her Adran was much better than the man’s. More refined and\npracticed. An interpreter, maybe? Or someone more important?\n“A good reason for you to talk to me,” Vlora shot back. “Not the other\nway around.” Beside her, Bo cleared his throat. “What is your advice,\nMagus Borbador?” Vlora asked sharply, with far more acid in her tone than\nshe’d intended.\n“Never hurts to talk,” Bo said quietly.\n“Doesn’t it? It hurts right now, and I have Dynize blades and bullets to\nthank for that.”\nThe messengers exchanged another glance. The woman nudged her\nhorse forward a few steps. “A gift,” she said, tossing a bundle to Vlora.\nVlora fumbled the small package but managed to avoid the\nembarrassment of dropping it. It was a bit of cloth wrapped in twine. She\nmanaged to unbind it, and a small piece of metal dropped into her hand. It\nwas a silver powder keg. No, not any silver powder keg. Hers, with initials\ncarved into the back. It still had her blood in the grooves. “How did you get\nthis?” she demanded.\n“A dragoon,” the woman explained. “He cut it off your uniform just\nbefore your friends arrived from Adro. He played dead to avoid the\nslaughter, and then fled. He stumbled into our camp two days ago.”\n“And why give it back?”\n“It’s our custom,” the woman said, using two fingers to frame the small\nstud in her ear that looked an awful lot like a human tooth, “to take trophies\nfrom the dead. We do not take them from the living. General Etepali\nbelieved you should have it back.”\n“Did he?”\n“She,” the man corrected."

General Etepali\nbelieved you should have it back.”\n“Did he?”\n“She,” the man corrected.\nVlora felt the urge to send the silver powder keg back, along with the\nheads of the two messengers. The thought had barely entered her mind\nwhen she shook it off. What kind of response was that? To what end? Was\nthat really the woman she was becoming? “I’ll meet your general,” she\nsnapped. “In my camp. Eight o’clock.”\n“Do you give your word as an Adran officer that she will be unharmed?”\nthe old woman asked.\nDavd urged his horse up in a few quick bounds, bringing it abreast of the\nmessenger’s mounts. “Don’t question my Lady Flint,” he growled.\nThe old woman seemed unperturbed. “Your Lady Flint has murdered\nnumerous Dynize officers. My general hopes to keep her own life intact, at\nleast until the actual fighting begins.”\n“Stand down, Davd,” Vlora ordered. The last thing she wanted to do was\nspeak with a Dynize officer. It would come to nothing, of course. The\nDynize would not give up their prize of the godstones and Vlora would not\ngive up trying to take them. But a small bit of honor managed to wriggle\npast the ugliness that had made a home inside her. Tamas himself had\npinned this powder keg to her breast. Having it again, even without the\nsorcery that it represented, was no small thing. “I give my word. I’ll talk to\nher. But once the fighting starts…” She shrugged.\n“Understood.” The messengers bowed and turned around, trotting back\ntoward the Dynize earthworks.\nVlora returned to the general staff. Deep in thought, she barely heard\nsomeone asking her what had happened, and waved off any other questions.\n“Set up camp,” she ordered. “I want our own earthworks dug by morning in\ncase of a counterattack. Make sure we secure the coast and have a line of\ncommunication with our fleet. Someone find out why Olem hasn’t returned\nyet. Oh, and set up the general-staff tent. I’m having a guest tonight.”\nCHAPTER 11\nW\ne have to talk,” Styke said.\nHe fell to the back of the column, where Ka-poel lagged a dozen paces\nbehind the last of the Mad Lancers, sitting back in her saddle, riding with a\ntuneless whistle on her lips and a casual eye on passing Dynize. She\nstopped whistling as he approached and made an open-handed gesture at\nher left side, her sign for Celine.\n“No,” Styke answered. “Just the two of us. I think I’ve got enough of a\ngrasp of your sign language for a conversation.”\nShe pursed her lips, giving him the impression that she already knew\nwhat this was about. Over the last couple of days they had made decent\nheadway—according to Orz, they were less than twenty miles from the\ncapital.

Styke was\nimpressed that the ruse had lasted as long as it had, though the logic behind\nit was sound.\nNo one goes out of their way to question authority figures. In Dynize, it\nseemed that was doubly the case.\nWith the current calm, it seemed a good time to get Ka-poel alone and\nhash out whatever was going on between them, sorcery-wise. Styke let\nAmrec fall in beside Ka-poel’s horse, matching paces.\n“You’re using your sorcery to protect me.” It wasn’t a question. Ka-poel\ndid not answer, so he went on. “You told me before that you’re not.”\nThe flurry of gestures that shot back at him was almost too much for\nhim to follow.\n“Slow down, slow down,” he said.\nShe repeated herself slowly. Which do you believe?\n“I believe that you’re protecting me.”\nYou say that like it’s a bad thing.\n“I say that like you lied to me.”\nKa-poel snorted. Lies among friends.\n“Lies among friends is me telling Markus that the cut of his jacket\ndoesn’t make him look like a fat sack of shit. Lies among friends is not you\ndigging your blood-witch hooks deep into my flesh.”\nTo protect you. The strength of the gesture emphasized the word\n“protect.” She continued, I protect my friends. You. Taniel. People who may\nbe in danger from other bone-eyes.\n“How many of those people do you prop up with your sorcery? How\nmany of them can shrug off wounds, fight through crippling pain, react with\nastonishing strength?”\nKa-poel narrowed her eyes at him. Only you and Taniel.\n“Right. And that stuff between you and Taniel? I don’t give a shit.\nYou’ve got your own deals. I get that. But me and you…”\nIs this because I’m not sleeping with you like I am Taniel? There was an\nunmistakable mocking tilt to the gestures.\n“Don’t be a child. I’m mad because Taniel gave you his permission. I\ndid not.”\nAnd why don’t you want my protection?\nStyke considered his words for a moment. “Because I’m Mad Ben\nStyke. I may be a bit in love with my own legend, and maybe that’s a fault\nof mine. But my strength? My resolve? I want those things to be mine. Not\na loan from some blood sorcerer. Do you understand what I mean at all?”\nFor a moment, Ka-poel looked almost pouty. She turned away, scowling,\nand took nearly a full minute before finally looking back at him. She gave a\nsmall nod. She continued to gesture. Maybe. But you’re a fool for turning\ndown such a gift. I don’t give it lightly, you know.\n“Yeah, but like I said: I didn’t ask for it. You can’t guilt someone into\naccepting a gift they don’t want.”\nI only give you enough to keep you alive. It doesn’t take much. You’re\nvery strong on your own.\nStyke felt like she was finally listening. Bargaining. Stroking his ego. A"

        "text": "I only give you enough to keep you alive. It doesn’t take much. You’re\nvery strong on your own.\nStyke felt like she was finally listening. Bargaining. Stroking his ego. A\nsmall weight left his shoulders, and he realized that he’d been afraid of\nwhat would happen if she simply told him that he belonged to her now. But\nthis was not a dialogue between master and slave. He took a deep breath.\n“All right. Let’s start this over. How does it work?”\nIt’s a sort of link between us. I can allow you to feed off the strength of\nmy sorcery, giving you more or cutting you off when you do or do not need\nit. Once the bond is established, it doesn’t take much effort on my part to\nkeep it going. Giving you too much strength does exhaust me, however. The\nexplanation was so long that Styke had to make her repeat the series of\ngestures twice before he got it all.\n“So is that why you were so tired after Starlight? Because you gave me\nso much strength? It seems like you’re only now recovering from it.”\nKa-poel smirked. No. You drew some energy from me during that fight,\nbut most of it was going to Taniel.\n“I’m guessing he needed it?”\nOur communication isn’t perfect, but I understand he faced down a\ncouple of Dynize brigades.\nStyke was in the middle of drinking from his canteen and spat half of it\ndown the front of him. “By himself?”\nI’m not sure. But he drew enough power from me to do so.\n“He’s really that strong?”\nWe’re really that strong, Ka-poel corrected. She seemed to recognize her\nown arrogance and made a small gesture of humility. It nearly killed us\nboth. Neither of us can repeat that performance. I’ve called him to join me\nhere, actually, though it will take him some time to reach us.\nTaniel’s presence would certainly be helpful, Styke conceded to himself.\nEven if he had only a fraction of the strength required to fight a couple of\nDynize brigades. He dismissed the thought and focused on the present.\n“Look, I know you think this is necessary. But my strength… it must be my\nown.”\nAre you sure?\n“I’m sure.”\nA small war played out over Ka-poel’s face. He could practically feel\nher weighing the options, wondering if she should make the decision for\nhim—or simply lie to him again. Her mouth finally settled into a firm line\nand her hands flashed. I’ll withdraw my power. But I also don’t want\nanother bone-eye getting a hold of you.\n“So you want to keep a close eye on me?”\nBut I won’t do it without your permission.\nThere was the bargain. Styke grunted, feeling as if he was still being\nplayed somehow. But she had a point. Ka-Sedial was a world away, with no\nmethod of leverage, but there might be other bone-eyes in the capital just as\ncapable of taking control of him. Given the choice, he’d rather risk Ka-\npoel’s sorcery than a stranger’s. “All right. But just a watchful eye. I’m not\nTaniel. I’m not your champion. I’m just a temporary bodyguard.”\nKa-poel leaned across the gap and patted him on the cheek. The gesture"

        "text": "Taniel. I’m not your champion. I’m just a temporary bodyguard.”\nKa-poel leaned across the gap and patted him on the cheek. The gesture\nhad all the gentleness of an elderly grandmother, but the moment her fingers\ntouched his skin, he felt an electric shock that traveled from his face to the\ntips of his fingers and toes. He flinched back, but the feeling was so brief\nthat he thought he had imagined it. A few moments passed, and he squinted\nhis eyes against a sudden headache. He looked down at his hands, flexing\nhis fingers, feeling them react just a tiny bit more slowly to his commands.\nLittle aches that he hadn’t realized were there came into focus; from the old,\nhealed-over bullet wounds to the sorcerously stitched stabs and slashes\nfrom Starlight.\nThe cascade of painful echoes hitting him from every part of his body\nwere at once hateful and welcome. He found himself gasping for breath,\neyes burning, while a sense of freedom lifted his heart. He nodded to Ka-\npoel and realized that he was grinning stupidly.\nYou like that? she signed with a cocked eyebrow.\n“It’s not a matter of liking it,” Styke replied. “I know it. I recognize it.\nThis body is mine again.”\nI never…, she began, but let her hands drop. She gestured dismissively,\nrolling her eyes.\nTheir conversation was interrupted as the group ahead of them turned\noff the road into a large inn complex. The stop was not unexpected, and the\nplace was fairly deserted, so the Lancers dismounted and began to water\ntheir horses at a large fountain. Styke pulled away from Ka-poel and\nattended to Amrec, then made sure that Celine had properly taken care of\nMargo.\nWatching while Celine brushed down her horse, and giving the\noccasional pointer, Styke was soon joined by Markus and Zak. “Where’s\nour local guide?” Styke asked.\n“Requisitioning supplies from the owner of this place,” Zak answered.\nStyke lifted his eyes to the road and watched as some fifteen soldiers\nmarched into the large courtyard of the inn. Most were barely old enough to\nwear the uniforms, and their morion helmets and breastplates fit poorly.\nSeveral had bad sunburns, telling of inexperience when it came to marching\nall day.\nKeeping one eye on the soldiers, he asked Markus, “Is something\nwrong?”\n“Just curious if we’re going to be able to scout at some point,” Zak\nanswered for his brother in a low whisper. “I know how little you like going\nblind into things, and we’ve been riding on the word of that foreigner for\nthe last couple days. We’re sitting ducks all gathered up into one group,\nwith no eyes out front or back.”\n“You’re right, I don’t like it,” Styke answered. Speaking in Palo wasn’t\nthe same as Dynize, but it was close enough that if they were overheard, it\nmight be mistaken for bad Dynize. “But our friend hasn’t lied to us yet. And\nhaving either of you ahead or trailing us only makes it all the more likely\nthat you’re stopped and questioned. No, we stay with the dragonman. All of\nus.”\nThe brothers nodded unhappily. “Could Jackal speak to his spirits? Get a"

        "text": "that you’re stopped and questioned. No, we stay with the dragonman. All of\nus.”\nThe brothers nodded unhappily. “Could Jackal speak to his spirits? Get a\nlay of the land?” Markus asked with a mix of hesitancy and hope.\n“I haven’t asked him lately. He hasn’t had much luck with the blood\nwitch around. Speaking of which…” Styke looked around for Jackal. His\neyes landed on the big round fountain in the center of the courtyard, where\nthe newly arrived soldiers had begun to water their horses and themselves.\nThe soldiers didn’t give Styke and the rest of the Kressians more than a few\ncurious glances—they seemed to write off the naval infantry uniforms\nwithout a second thought.\nBut Jackal was kneeling beside the fountain, dunking his head in the\nwater, then slicking it off his head and face before repeating the action.\nAnyone with eyes could see that Jackal wasn’t quite Dynize and it seemed\nto make the soldiers more than a little curious.\nThree of the Dynize soldiers gathered around him in a loose knot that\nquickly tightened. Zak and Markus both took a step in their direction, but\nStyke grabbed them by their shoulders. “Go find Orz,” he told them, then\nbegan to walk slowly toward the fountain, acting casual, his hands behind\nhis back instead of in a fist and on his knife like he wanted them. He hoped\nthe situation resolved itself before he even reached the fountain.\n“Where are you from?” he heard one of the guards ask in Dynize.\nJackal had been learning Dynize along with the rest of the soldiers. But,\nlike the rest, he was in no state to speak openly with a native. He ignored\nthe soldiers and dunked his head again. When he came back up, one of them\n—a tall woman with head shaved around a single topknot—grabbed him by\nthe shoulder.\n“Where are you from?” she asked again, somewhat more aggressively.\nJackal smiled at her and tapped his ears, then his throat, and shook his\nhead.\n“What are you, mute?” The woman’s tone took on a mocking edge. The\ntwo men with her both laughed at the question, though Styke wondered\nwhat could possibly be funny about it. One suddenly snatched Jackal\nbeneath an arm, jerking him to his feet. Jackal spun with the pull, letting\nhimself stumble into the two men and using the motion to disguise that he’d\npulled his knife.\nStyke was on them in a few quick strides. He quickly shouldered\nbetween Jackal and the three soldiers, looking down on them with a\nmeasured calm while he struggled internally not to draw his own weapon.\nThe woman took an involuntary step back. Styke put a hand on the chest\nof one of the men, pushing him gently. Orz had taught him the equivalent\nexpression for “Let me buy you a drink,” so he used it. “You’ve had a long\nday in the sun,” he suggested in broken Dynize.\n“Is there something wrong?” The sergeant in charge of this crew sidled\nover to Styke, looking him up and down with one long glance and then\nturning his attention to the three soldiers. “Well?”\nTopknot’s lip curled. “This slave was disrespectful,” she said, gesturing"

He and Jackal could cut\nthe four of them down without drawing a sweat. The other eleven might be\na problem, though. “I apologize,” he said, bowing very slightly at the waist.\nOrz had said that bows were important here. “This slave cannot speak.”\n“But he can still answer a question!” Topknot’s blood was up.\n“How?” Styke asked, hoping that his inflection said just how obvious\nthe question was. He couldn’t help but wonder at her background. She had\nto be a noble of some kind, or at least what passed for nobility in Dynize. A\nbastard of a prominent Household maybe, sent to the infantry to get wise.\nShe couldn’t be more than seventeen, but she had the arrogance of a Kez\nofficer.\nShe glared at him, ignoring the question.\n“I’m sorry,” Styke repeated.\nThe sergeant didn’t seem all that interested in the spat. He turned to\nStyke and gave a regretful sigh. “It is within her right. You are slaves.” His\nface and tone expressed sympathy.\n“I have apologized.” Styke realized that he was gripping the handle of\nhis knife and forced himself to let go. “I think we should take this no\nfurther.”\n“I—!”\nTopknot was cut off by the timely arrival of Orz. The dragonman swept\ninto the confrontation smoothly, putting himself between Styke and the\nsergeant in much the same way as Styke had between Jackal and the\nsoldiers.\nThe sergeant’s nostrils flared and the three soldiers immediately\nretreated several steps. “This property does not belong to you,” Orz said to\nTopknot in a dangerously low voice.\nThe sergeant was white-faced. He backed away, bowing low with every\nstep. “No, there is no problem, Servant of God. My apologies.”\nOrz glared the group back to the other side of the courtyard and then\nwalked, unhurriedly, around the Mad Lancers. “It’s time to go,” he told\nthem quietly, a note of urgency in his tone. They were soon on the road and,\nonce they’d gone around a bend and were safely out of the sight of the inn,\nwere riding double-time at Orz’s suggestion.\n“What happened back there?” Orz demanded, pulling Styke up to the\nfront of the column.\nStyke found himself gripping his knife again. He let go. “They took an\ninterest in Jackal.”\n“They don’t see a lot of Palo here. Kressians are rare, but everyone has\nseen a slave and knows better than to fool with them. Palo, though?” Orz let\nout a litany of words that Styke had not learned. “Those recruits are nothing\nmore than goddamn children,” he finally finished. “We’ve sent so many\nsoldiers overseas that they’ve lowered the recruiting age to sixteen.

It’s\nbecome a point of pride among the Households to put their less useful\nmembers into the infantry to fill out the ranks, no matter how unqualified or\nprivileged.”\nStyke hadn’t been that far off with his guess, then. “How do you know\nall this?”\n“Because I’ve been questioning every innkeeper we pass for the last\ncouple of days. I haven’t been a free man in Dynize for years. I need\ninformation. That’s why I was taking so long to get supplies.”\n“Will this be a problem?”\n“Only if they follow us,” Orz said, glancing over his shoulder.\n“They backed off in a hurry when they saw you.”\n“And a good thing, too. A blind man could have seen the violence in\nyou.”\n“I was restraining myself,” Styke protested.\n“Like a dog at the end of a chain.” Orz spat angrily. “Slaves don’t have\nsuch violence in them, Styke. Even the Household guards know their place.\nThey don’t stand up to Dynize.”\n“What good is a guard who isn’t allowed to fight?”\nOrz swore again. “It’s complicated! If I had been standing there and\nordered you to kill them, it would have been acceptable. But not on your\nown.”\n“That’s stupid.”\n“That’s the way things are done!”\nStyke bit down on his tongue, trying hard not to argue. This wasn’t his\nland. He couldn’t be himself if he wanted them to get through this alive. “I\nwon’t allow them to attack one of my men.”\n“Even to save the rest?”\n“No.”\nOrz inhaled sharply, studying Styke’s face. His calm seemed to return to\nhim in the span of a few short breaths and he shook his head. “You are a\nwonder, Ben Styke.”\n“I’m an officer. A shitty one, most of the time. But I’ve always protected\nmy men from the injustice of tyrants. It’s one of my few good qualities, and\nI’ve reached the age that I’m just not going to let that go.” The words\nflowed without Styke even thinking about them, and he was a little\nsurprised at himself. It was something he’d always known he felt strongly\nabout, but the logical part of his brain told him that he should have been\nmore flexible. He should have let Jackal take a beating for the rest of them.\nBut he’d never let it go when lives and wars were at stake in Fatrasta.\nWhy here?\n“All right,” Orz finally said. “Let’s just keep well ahead of those\nsoldiers. We reach the city ahead of them, then we disappear. They might\ngossip at some point, but as long as we move quickly, it shouldn’t be a\nproblem.” He did not sound like he believed it.\n“Is it so rare for slaves to stand up for themselves?”\n“Yes,” Orz answered without hesitation.\n“Why?”\n“Because they are conditioned. Before they reach any level of station\nwithin a Household, they are broken and remolded. If they cannot be\nbroken, they are killed.” Styke bit his tongue to hold back a retort. The"

        "text": "within a Household, they are broken and remolded. If they cannot be\nbroken, they are killed.” Styke bit his tongue to hold back a retort. The\nanger was still there, festering. He twirled his ring to keep himself from\nchecking his carbine.\n“What do you think happens to dragonmen?” Orz asked, shooting him a\nlook. “Dragonmen, bone-eyes, and Privileged are all tools of the state. But\nthe truth is, everyone in Dynize belongs to someone else. Even the heads of\nthe Households belong to the emperor. Foreign slaves are lower than\nHousehold grunts. It makes them a target.”\n“You could have mentioned that before.”\n“You’re with a dragonman and a bone-eye. The chances of you actually\nbeing a target were not very high.”\nStyke ground his teeth. He suddenly felt very tired, and he wondered if\nKa-poel’s sorcery had been giving him energy that he did not have. It\nseemed likely. He was tired and hurting, and he definitely did not want to\nride another ten hours before they next slept. “All right. We ride late\ntonight. I don’t want to meet those soldiers again. We’ll stay ahead of any\nquestions.”\nCHAPTER 12\nT\no their credit, Meln-Dun’s men had set up a fairly thorough command\ncenter for their search of Greenfire Depths. It was located in one of the\noffices above the warehouse. Two walls were covered in police sketches of\nknown associates of Mama Palo, as well as long descriptions of anyone\nwhose sketches they hadn’t managed to acquire. A third wall allowed light\nin through big, leaded windows with broken panes. The final had a massive\nmap of Greenfire Depths scrawled with notes and marked with large red\nX’s.\nMichel was mostly interested in that map, but the moment he entered, he\ntook a few seconds to examine the motley group of searchers. They\nincluded two women and six men, in addition to himself, Ichtracia, and\nDahre. All were Palo, of course, though he could tell from the variety of\ndress that they came from—or attempted to mark themselves from—all\nwalks of life. Only two wore the traditional brown cotton laborers’ suits\nfound most commonly among city Palo. Both women wore buckskins.\nAnother dressed like a Brudanian merchant with a tricorn hat and a finely\nmade blue cotton jacket.\nDahre himself sat in a chair pushed back on two legs, his feet up on the\ncorner of a ratty old sofa, a pewter mug of coffee in one hand. He looked\nlike a tired old police captain about to give the morning briefing to his\nsergeants, and the very sight of him made Michel wistful for Captain\nBlasdell. He wondered what had happened to her, and hoped she’d gotten\nout of the city ahead of the Dynize purges.\nDahre touched his forehead in greeting. “Everyone, this is Tellurin and\nAvenya. They’re thief-takers from up in Brannon Bay, and they’ll be\nhelping us with the search.” He went around and introduced the searchers.\nMichel cast the names to memory but only took particular note of two of\nthem: an older man with a harelip, who glared at them at the mention of"

        "text": "Michel cast the names to memory but only took particular note of two of\nthem: an older man with a harelip, who glared at them at the mention of\n“thief-takers,” and one of the pair in buckskins—a young woman who\nsmirked at Ichtracia, then rolled her eyes openly at Michel.\nThe rest of the group seemed pleased to get additional help. Those two,\nhowever, could be trouble.\n“This is a decent setup you have here,” Michel said, heading\nimmediately to the map of Greenfire Depths. “I’m guessing one of you has\npolice experience?”\nThe glare on the old man’s face softened slightly. “Aye, that was me.\nTwenty-five years with the Palo Irregular Division here in the Depths.”\n“Couhila, is it?” Michel asked.\n“That’s me.”\n“Very well done.”\nThe glare softened a little more and the old man gave Michel an\nappreciative nod. Police generally didn’t like thief-takers, seeing them as\nlittle more than localized bounty hunters, but few people would argue that\nan experienced thief-taker was often the best option for tracking down\nsomeone in hiding. Michel’s take-charge tone was calculated to take\nadvantage of that reputation.\nDahre pointed to the young woman who’d rolled her eyes at Michel.\n“Devin-Mezi here helped the Dynize back when they did a big search of the\ncatacombs for that Blackhat bomber. She was with the Household in control\nof the search, and offered a lot of good suggestions.”\nMichel tried not to bristle. Devin-Mezi would definitely have to be\nwatched. If she had been helping out in the Yaret Household, there was a\ngood chance she had seen his face on more than one occasion. “Good.” He\nnodded. “All this is very good.” He pointed at the X’s. “Are these the spots\nyou’ve already checked?”\nA round of nods answered him. It was, he could tell at a glance, the one\nbig flaw in their organization of the search. They were hitting random spots\n—probably by virtue of tip-offs and false leads. There was no method to the\nmadness, and Michel said as much. “Just hitting the spots where we have\nintelligence isn’t going to find us a Palo freedom fighter. No, this Mama\nPalo… she’s probably mobile, able to double back and change hiding spots\nat will. If she’s at all smart, she has a portable map that looks just like this\nand that tells her wherever you’ve been raiding.”\n“How will she know where we’re going to hit next?” Devin-Mezi asked,\nher lip curled.\nMichel looked between Devin-Mezi and Couhila. Those were the two he\nwas worried about, and he needed to make an enemy of one and a friend of\nthe other. His compliments already seemed to have worked on Couhila.\n“Because she’s clearly not an idiot,” he snapped back. “Freedom fighters\ndon’t last long if they can’t keep ahead of the local magistrates. She’s\nprobably got as many eyes and ears as you spread throughout the Depths.”\nHe knew for a fact that she did, and that she was smart. Ka-poel would have\nleft her most capable agent in charge.\n“So what do we do about it?” Couhila asked."

Ka-poel would have\nleft her most capable agent in charge.\n“So what do we do about it?” Couhila asked.\nMichel nodded respectfully. “These are great tools,” he said, gesturing\naround the room. “But we need to use them smarter. Brannon Bay doesn’t\nhave a rat’s nest like Greenfire Depths, but it does have slums. The only\nway to flush someone out is by working methodically.” To emphasize his\npoint, he punched a finger at a landmark in the southeastern corner of the\nDepths and then punched another spot, then another, working inward from\nthe Rim. “We crack down on anyone who knows them. We spread around\nmoney and threats, leaving a network of informants behind us everywhere\nwe go.”\nDahre lifted his pewter mug, sipped from it, then spoke for the first time\nsince making introductions. “That is, uh, very ambitious.”\nMichel shrugged it off. “I worked for some old-hand thief-takers and\ntheir very rich clients up in Brannon Bay. You said money was no object, so\n—”\n“Within reason,” Dahre cut in.\n“Within reason,” Michel agreed. “We can’t do this on a budget, of\ncourse, but based on what you already have set up here, I think we can do it\nwithout going crazy. A couple more thugs, plus fifty thousand krana for\nbribes—”\nHe was interrupted again, this time by Devin-Mezi. She burst out\nlaughing. “Fifty thousand a person? What, are you planning on taking a cut\nof each bribe?”\n“Total,” Michel snapped at her. “Spread fifty thousand around the\nDepths with a little bit of thought and we’ll find this freedom fighter right\nquick.” He glanced at Ichtracia, who still stood near the door with her hands\nin her pockets, eyeballing the group. She had already begun to get more\ncomfortable around the Palo, but he could still see a bit of wariness in her\neyes, her body tensed as if ready to run or fight. “Look,” he said to Devin-\nMezi, “if you want to jump around chasing ghosts, fine by me. I’ve got a\nweekly retainer. But my finding bonus is bigger the quicker I get things\ndone and this is the way to do it. Or I’ll walk.”\nDahre got to his feet quickly, clearing his throat. “No, no!” he said. “No\nneed to walk away. I like where this is going. Method might be the very\nthing we need to find this bitch and get back to settling the Depths.”\nDevin-Mezi sneered at Michel. Couhila looked pleased with himself.\nMichel noted that the old police sergeant wasn’t a fan of the young upstart.\nHe could use that information to his advantage. “Right. You mentioned the\ncatacombs. Are they on the map?” Michel asked.\n“As many as we could piece together. That big Blackhat purge shuffled\nthrough a thousand miles of catacombs, so we know them a little better than\nwe did before, but there’s still a lot of space.” Dahre approached the map,\nsquinting at it. “To be honest, most of the more traditional Palo are scared"

Superstition and all that. She might be hiding out there, but there\nare still cave-ins, booby traps, bad air, and the real threat of getting lost. I’d\nwager next week’s wages that she’s here in the Depths.”\nMichel began shaking his head before Dahre was finished talking. He\nagreed with the foreman, but he also didn’t want them to actually catch\nMama Palo. He needed them to get close—just close enough that he could\nfind her on his own. No harm in muddying the water a little. “I respectfully\ndisagree. Danger might keep some of us away from the catacombs, but not\na freedom fighter. Their whole life is danger. The prospect of getting lost\nwon’t scare them. We need to look under every rock, search every tunnel. If\nyou have extra people, put them on regular sweeps.”\nDahre scowled, but gave a reluctant nod.\nMichel examined the map for a few moments. “We start here,” he said,\npointing to a spot not all that far from the quarry. “The first thing we do is\ncanvas. Minor bribes, promises of jobs and riches. Then we act quickly on\nany information we get in this area. Smash-and-grab sort of raids that might\nlet us get our hands on a lieutenant or anyone else who knows more about\nMama Palo’s whereabouts.”\n“This technique. It’s just like the Blackhats,” Couhila said. By his tone\nhe was just trying to be helpful, but a round of scowls followed the\nsuggestion.\nMichel spat on the floor and made a disgusted face. “Unfortunately, yes.\nThose shitbags are good at this sort of thing.”\n“I don’t like using their tactics,” the Palo dressed like a Brudanian\nmerchant spoke up.\n“You think the Blackhats invented this kind of thing?” Michel said,\nturning aggressively on the man. “No. This kind of thing has been\nhappening for a thousand years. If you want to make a political statement\nabout it, be my guest, but do it after we’ve done our jobs.” He let his glare\npass around the room, noting Dahre’s smirk. The foreman knew exactly\nwhat Michel was doing and he seemed to approve.\nOf course he did. This was just another job to finish.\n“All right, let’s get going,” Michel said, pointing around the group. “The\nDepths has as many as twenty levels, right? You two, take the top levels.\nYou three try to drop down just below them. You three get the bottom level.\nMe and Avenya will fill in everything else. Remember, we’re not trying to\ngrab anyone, not immediately. Right now we’re just asking questions,\nspreading around a little bit of money. Maybe some of these Dynize rations\ncards. You find anything, you report it to me and Dahre.”\nThe group began to split up. Michel waited until most were gone and\nwent over to Dahre. “Sorry for taking over there,” he said quietly. “Didn’t\nmean to step on your toes.” Polite and likable.

He\nwaited until they were some distance from the quarry and had lost their new\ncoworkers before he rubbed both hands through his short hair and bent over,\nstaring at the slime-covered ground and taking long, unsteady breaths. He\nlet his disguise slowly drop, losing the quietly confident smile and the\nthoughtful look in his eye. His body was suddenly seized with the tension\nof being someone else the whole day, and he saw a bit of a tremble in his\nfingertips.\n“I don’t think I ever realized how terrifying you are.”\nMichel looked up at Ichtracia. Her body language was still very tense,\nbut now she was watching him with a strange look in her eye. “Me?”\n“Yes, you. Watching you slide into a different person like it was a suit of\nclothes. Glad-handing. Warm and friendly. When I found out that you\nweren’t who you said you were, I thought both myself and Yaret were fools\nfor taking you in. But now that I’ve seen you work…” She let out a small\nlaugh and shook her head. “I knew you were good at what you do, but that\nis absolutely frightening.”\nMichel smiled at the compliment, but he didn’t feel it. There was a sour\nnote in his stomach that he couldn’t ignore—one that he’d felt on several\noccasions. Dahre, Couhila, even Devin-Mezi. All these Palo working for\nMeln-Dun weren’t bad people. “I like Dahre,” he said quietly.\n“He seems like a competent sort. But he was taken in by you in an\ninstant.”\n“More’s the pity.”\n“You don’t want to do your job?” Ichtracia seemed surprised by this.\n“It’s not about ‘want.’ I need to, so I will. But deceiving all these people\nday in, day out. It…” Michel trailed off. He’d been about to say “it takes its\ntoll,” but considering that Ichtracia was one of those people he’d deceived,\nhe didn’t expect much empathy. Slowly, he pulled his mask back on. “Let’s\ndo a little groundwork for Dahre’s group. See if we can get a whiff of\nMama Palo.”\nIchtracia watched him carefully for a moment, clearly thrown off by his\nshift back into character. “Think we’ll find her?”\n“We better. My whole plan hinges on making contact. But we’ve got\nother work to do as well.”\n“Setting up Meln-Dun?”\nMichel grinned. “That’s the fun part, yeah.”\nCHAPTER 13\nT\nhe Dynize general arrived ten minutes early, riding up to the Adran\nperimeter with an honor guard of thirty soldiers and two Privileged.

        "text": "CHAPTER 13\nT\nhe Dynize general arrived ten minutes early, riding up to the Adran\nperimeter with an honor guard of thirty soldiers and two Privileged. Vlora\ngreeted them on foot, flanked by Davd, Nila, and Bo while Norrine and\nBuden kept watch for any trickery that might be afoot.\nVlora raised a hand in greeting, standing straight with her sword at her\nside and wearing the returned powder-keg pin on her dress uniform. It was\nall she could do to remain standing after a long day of reviewing the freshly\nlaid camp, and she half hoped that this enemy general proved to be as\nprickly as her colleagues and would give her an excuse to cut this worthless\nsummit short.\nShe made an effort to still her negative thoughts. Just behind her,\nsoldiers had finished setting up the general-staff tent with chairs and\nrefreshment near the earthworks and had begun lighting torches to fend off\nthe coming dusk.\nThe Dynize general was a stout woman in her midfifties, with a scar that\ntraveled down the side of her face and one eye cloudy from what seemed\nlikely to be the same wound. She wore a turquoise dress uniform and\nearrings of colorful feathers, as well as a cavalry saber at her side, the hilt\nfestooned with ribbons.\n“Lady Flint,” the general said, swinging down from her horse.\nVlora extended her hand. The general gripped it, hard enough that it\nhurt, though Vlora couldn’t tell whether the act was intentional or if she was\nsimply that fragile. She smiled shallowly through the pain. “General\nEtepali?”\n“Correct.”\nVlora felt her exhaustion weighing on her, chipping at what little\nrestraint she still held. “General, I can’t help but wonder why you requested\nthis meeting. It seems rather pointless, considering that we both know we’ll\nbe fighting a battle tomorrow.”\nSeveral of the general’s retinue gasped audibly.\n“I’m not trying to be rude,” Vlora added, “just trying to save us both\nsome time.” The words sounded forced in her own ears, and she realized\nhow dismissive and angry she sounded—well past rude and on to insulting.\nEtepali took in a sharp breath and muttered something before finally\nsaying, “You’d treat a fellow general with such disdain?” Her expression\nspoke of the same haughtiness as the other Dynize generals she’d met, and\nVlora found herself letting out an irritated sigh.\n“I don’t have time for this,” she said, fully ready to turn her back on the\ngroup.\n“Wait, wait.” The voice came from somewhere at the back of the retinue.\nA horse muscled its way through the small crowd ridden by the old woman\nwho’d come as a messenger earlier. She rode up beside her general’s horse\nand swung down with the restrained enthusiasm of an experienced rider.\nShe said something quickly in Dynize, and General Etepali gave a short\nbow and backed away.\nVlora found herself frozen, one foot off the ground for her to turn back\nto her camp. “What’s this?” she asked cautiously.\n“She’s not General Etepali,” the old woman said. “I am.” She strode\nforward, taking Vlora by the arm like a grandmother. “Shall we leave the"

She waved off Davd with a subtle gesture and\nshot Bo a look before being pulled inside.\nThe tent had been set up for twenty people. A table at the far end was\nlaid out with Adran spirits and an assortment of breads, sweets, and salted\nmeats that Bo had somehow magicked up from the camp followers. The old\nwoman dropped Vlora’s arm just inside the tent and looked around with a\ncritical eye. “This is very nice, thank you.” She made a beeline for the\nrefreshment table, leaning down to peer at the labels on the bottles before\npouring two drinks. She brought one to Vlora, then found a chair and pulled\nit around and took a seat.\nVlora looked dumbly at the drink in her hand. “I’m sorry, but I’m not\nentirely certain what’s going on here.”\n“My officers,” Etepali explained, “were very insistent that I not meet\nyou in person. I told them that I’d come as an observer and let someone else\npretend to be me.”\n“You thought that I’d kill you under a flag of truce?”\nThe old woman sipped her drink, examining Vlora with bright, intense\neyes over the rim of the glass. Her silence answered Vlora’s question.\nVlora rubbed her jaw to relax the muscles and crossed the tent, sitting\ndown facing Etepali. “I didn’t mean to be rude out there. But I repeat my\nearlier question.”\n“Why waste time by meeting?” Etepali asked. “Because who wouldn’t\nwant to? You’re Vlora Flint. Hero of the Adran-Kez War. Hero of the Kez\nCivil War. Mercenary commander extraordinaire!” There was an air of\ngentle mockery about the last title, as if it didn’t belong with the first two.\n“There’s no way that my reputation goes all the way to Dynize,” Vlora\nsaid flatly.\nEtepali gave Vlora a coy smile. For the second time, Vlora found herself\ntrying to guess Etepali’s age. She couldn’t be any younger than sixty.\nPerhaps closer to seventy. “You’d be surprised.” She looked at her glass,\nsmirked, and continued, “But no, it doesn’t. I have a biography of Field\nMarshal Tamas that a spy brought me a few years ago. It mentions you\nbriefly, but otherwise I knew nothing about you before arriving in Landfall.\nI’ve been reading, though, and there is quite a lot of literature on the famous\nVlora Flint.”\n“So what about me?”\n“You’re interesting. Fiery. Loyal. Principled. Conflicted. You remind me\nof me.”\nAt another time, Vlora would have liked this woman. She knew that\nright away. But she was tired and irritable, and that terrible urge for\nviolence was still planted firmly inside of her.

All she could think about was\na few hours of restless sleep and the inevitable battle that would come\ntomorrow. “I suppose I should take that as a compliment.”\nThe old woman puffed out her cheeks, letting a breath blow through her\nlips slowly before answering. “I don’t mean to be self-aggrandizing, but\nyou don’t know who I am. You couldn’t. So I’m going to tell you.” She\ndrained the last of her drink—single-malt Adran whiskey, now that Vlora\nhad taken a chance to sip her own—and continued. “I, too, was a young\ngeneral. Decorated to the rank at thirty-five, during the height of the\nviolence of the Dynize civil war. I’ve fought in over sixty battles. I’ve\ncommanded half of them, and I’ve only lost two.” She held up a pair of\nfingers to emphasize the point.\n“Are you trying to intimidate me?” Vlora asked, slightly taken aback.\n“Of course not. I’m just giving you context. When I read that biography\nof Field Marshal Tamas, it was like seeing a ghostly reflection of myself in\na mirror. Not his life experiences and campaigns, of course. But the way he\nthought. His passions. His strengths and weaknesses. It was startling. And\nthen I found out that he had three children: a warrior, a mage, and a general.\nNow, I would be as interested as anyone else to meet the warrior and the\nmage.” She cast a glance toward the flap as if to indicate she knew exactly\nwho Borbador was. “But the general…” She shook her head with a small\nsmile. “I never had children of my own. Men aren’t my interest, if you\ncatch my meaning. If I had a daughter, however, I like to think she’d be a\nlot like you.” She leaned back, took another sip of whiskey. “That, my dear,\nis why I wanted to meet you.”\nVlora blinked at the old woman in surprise. “That’s it?”\n“Of course that’s it. I’m old, Vlora. Can I call you Vlora? Yes, well I’m\nold, Vlora, and I’ve fought so many battles that I’m far less interested in the\nresults than in who fought them.”\n“You’re not like the other Dynize generals I’ve met.”\n“Sedial’s lapdogs? Of course not. Assholes, the lot of them—just like\ntheir master.”\nVlora snorted.\n“You’re surprised I’d call the Great Ka an asshole?” Etepali shrugged.\n“He is. I’ve told him to his face, and I’m not the only one who wishes that\nsomeone else had gotten credit for ending the civil war. My cousin Yaret,\nwell, he…” She laughed. “Sorry, I’m going too far off topic.”\n“No, no… this is quite interesting.”\nEtepali gave her a knowing smile. “Looking for Dynize gossip?\nSomewhere to twist the knife? I’m not going to defect, Vlora. We will have\na battle tomorrow. It’s possible that one of us will die during the fighting,\nand I wanted to meet you before that happens.”"

        "text": "a battle tomorrow. It’s possible that one of us will die during the fighting,\nand I wanted to meet you before that happens.”\nVlora frowned down at her glass. She thought about the silver powder\nkeg at her lapel, and she set down her glass and carefully unbuttoned the\npowder keg, holding it up to the lamp light. “What happened to the man\nwho took this from me?” she asked.\n“I had him shot.”\n“Why?”\n“Because by his own admission he led a cavalry charge against a single,\nhalf-dead woman and then played dead when it didn’t work out for him. I\ndon’t have room for that kind of cowardice in my army.”\n“He was following orders, I assume.”\n“Then he should have followed them all the way. He should have died\ntrying to finish you off instead of pulling a corpse over himself and hoping\nyour Privileged friends didn’t notice him. By the way,” she said, swirling\nthe amber liquid in her glass, “this is very good. May I have the rest of the\nbottle?”\nVlora made a fist around the powder-keg pin. “It’s yours.”\nEtepali beamed. “Wonderful. I appreciate your generosity.” She fetched\nthe bottle and stood behind her chair as if to signal that the meeting was\nover, and shook the bottle at Vlora. “If I win tomorrow, I hope that you’ll\nshare the rest of this bottle with me in the evening.”\n“Before you take my head for Ka-Sedial?”\nEtepali snorted. “As much as he thinks he is, Ka-Sedial is not the\nemperor. And I’m not a barbarian. You won’t be mistreated in my care.”\n“That’s something, I suppose.”\nThe old woman wagged her finger at Vlora. “It’s more than something.\nIt’s my promise. A word is worth a lot, Vlora. Don’t forget it in your grief\nand anger.”\nVlora looked up sharply, but Etepali had already turned her back. She\ndisappeared out through the tent flap in a few strides, leaving Vlora alone in\nthe large tent, a half-finished glass of whiskey in her hand. A few moments\nof loneliness passed before the flap stirred again and Vlora was joined by\nBo.\n“That was awfully short,” he said.\n“It was, wasn’t it?” Vlora asked distantly.\n“Did she make demands?”\n“None.”\n“She left here with a two-thousand-krana bottle of whiskey.”\n“I gave it to her. For this.” Vlora held the powder-keg pin up to the light.\n“So what did she want? Don’t tell me she came all the way over here to\npilfer some Adran booze.”\n“She wanted to meet me.”\nBo scrunched up his nose. “The whiskey was more worth her time, I’d\nsay. Is something wrong?”\nVlora swirled the glass under her nose absently and then finished it in\nthree large gulps. The burning sensation in the back of her throat felt good.\n“I have the oddest feeling that I’m missing something.”\n“About Etepali?”\n“About this entire meeting.

A subtext I didn’t read.” She set her glass on\nEtepali’s chair and struggled to her feet. “Tell them to clean this up. I’m\ngoing to bed. We have a battle to win in the morning.”\nCHAPTER 14\nD\no you know who she really is?”\nThe question came unexpectedly as the Mad Lancers set up camp,\nfumbling in the dark around the only empty site they’d spotted for several\nmiles. Styke looked up from lighting the tiny lantern he kept in his\nsaddlebags to find Orz’s shadowy face staring at him hard through the\ndarkness. It was very clear which “she” he was talking about.\nStyke finished lighting his lantern. He’d found a spot on the edge of the\ncampground for himself, and the only person within earshot was Celine. He\nrounded his horse, ignoring the question while he used his lantern to light\nCeline’s and then helped her get her saddlebags down from Margo. Once\nhe’d finished, he returned to Amrec and hung his lantern from a tree branch\noverhead.\n“I’m not sure if she knows who she really is,” he finally replied.\n“Don’t be cryptic with me, Ben Styke,” Orz said. “I need to know.”\nAt first, Styke hadn’t been sure if Orz was asking because he wanted to\ndiscuss Ka-poel’s lineage or whether the dragonman wasn’t actually certain.\nThis made it clear it was the latter. Styke opened his mouth, a reply on his\ntongue, and thought back to his own relation to Lindet. He’d kept that secret\nhis entire life. “It’s not my place to say,” he finally said.\n“Do you know?” There was an urgency to Orz’s tone.\n“I do.”\nOrz’s jaw tightened in the shadows cast by the lamp. Styke imagined\nthat if he were anyone else, Orz would resort to casual violence to get his\nanswers. Styke wondered if he still might, and let his hand rest lightly in his\nsaddlebag, fist tightening around one of the extra knives in his pack. A long\nsilence stretched between them.\n“It’s something I didn’t consider important at first. A foolish oversight\non my part,” Orz finally said. “I assumed that Palo had their own bone-eyes\nand that she was one of them.”\n“They do,” Styke replied. From what he’d been told, there were a few\nblood sorcerers in the deep swamp, but most Palo were bone-eyes in name\nonly—elders of the tribe, wise men and women.\n“Perhaps they do. But I’ve been studying her face since we encountered\nthose soldiers. She is not Palo. She is Dynize. I don’t know how I missed\nsomething so obvious.”\n“Don’t be too hard on yourself,” Styke said. He pulled his hand from his\nsaddlebag and worked to relieve Amrec of his burdens, setting up his\nbedroll and laying the saddlebags beside it.\nEither Orz didn’t notice the flippant remark or he chose to ignore it. He\ncontinued, “Knowing that she is Dynize brings up so many questions. Why\nwas she in Fatrasta? How did I not know that such a powerful bone-eye"

Is she a member of Sedial’s cabal, broken from her master and\nchanged sides? Is she a hidden weapon of the Fatrastans? Is she a member\nof another Household?”\nStyke disregarded the barrage of questions and continued to work in\nsilence, getting the saddle off Amrec and then taking some time to brush the\nbeast down and check his hooves. Orz watched, a frustrated look in his eye,\nsquatting at the edge of the lamplight like a creature who’d crawled out of\nthe swamp and wasn’t certain he liked what he saw.\n“If she has connections with the Dynize,” Orz voiced his thoughts again,\n“then she would have known about the capital. She would have known\nabout the Jagged Fens. Did she warn you?”\n“She didn’t know,” Styke answered quietly.\n“She is not of Dynize, but she has a Dynize name and a Dynize face.”\nHe scowled. “I’ve heard rumors of Dynize fleeing the mainland from the\nvery beginning of the civil war until the very end. Is she a lost Household?\nAre those common in Fatrasta?”\n“Not that I’m aware.”\nStyke finished his work and turned to face Orz. He’d noticed that the\ndragonman was guarded with his expressions, choosing when to let his\ninner thoughts play out upon his face. At the moment he appeared deep in\nthought, looking inward, the wheels of his brain in motion. Nearly a minute\npassed and no spark of understanding appeared in the dragonman’s eyes. He\nstraightened suddenly and snatched Styke’s lantern. “Come with me, girl. I\nneed you to translate,” Orz said to Celine before striding across the camp.\nCeline looked at Styke, startled. Styke felt his heart flutter. There was\ngoing to be a confrontation, and he needed to be there. “Come on,” he said,\ntaking her hand. “But if he starts to get angry, I want you to get behind me.”\nThey followed in the dragonman’s footsteps.\nKa-poel was down by the stream, no more than thirty yards from the\nedge of the camp. She was alone, sitting in the dark, her legs pulled up with\narms wrapped around her knees. It was the position of a fearful child, and\neven with the dragonman standing above her, lantern swinging, she stared\ninto the middle distance as if her mind was in another place.\n“Ka-poel,” Orz said.\nHer eyes flickered to him briefly. A finger twitched—such a small\ngesture, but it held the venom of a person who preferred to be left alone.\nWhat do you want? the movement demanded.\nHe seemed to get the gist, though if he read the subtext, he didn’t care.\n“I need to know who you are and what you plan to do with the godstones.”\nStyke approached slowly with Celine, and urged her with one hand to\nmove around to where she could face Ka-poel and see her hands easily.

Ka-\npoel looked at all of them without moving her head, her expression\ndarkening before being overtaken by something akin to resignation. Her\nhands flashed. It’s a long story, Celine translated for her.\nOrz hunkered down next to Celine. “I have time.”\nI don’t wish to discuss it right now.\n“I don’t care.”\nKa-poel looked up sharply to meet Orz’s eyes, but the dragonman did\nnot flinch away at her glare. They froze into a sort of battle of wills, and\nStyke found himself holding his breath, wondering which of the two would\nbreak first. If Orz made a move toward violence, Styke would need to step\nin. But he was also aware just how much they needed Orz’s help. He\nwanted to take the two of them by their collars and shake them, but he\nimagined that such an attempt would just earn him a pair of knives in the\ngut.\nNeither of them broke the staring match, but slowly Ka-poel’s hands\nbegan to move.\nI don’t know it all.\n“Explain.”\nKa-poel hesitated. She was not nearly as good as Orz at concealing her\nthoughts, and her face was writ with irritation. Styke wondered if she would\nrefuse just out of stubbornness, and found himself letting out a breath he did\nnot know he had held once she continued.\nI’m an orphan. I grew up in a Palo tribe in the Tristan Basin in western\nFatrasta. I’ve always known I was different. I’ve always known that I was\nDynize, and that my sorcery was strong. The rest I have only begun to piece\ntogether. She made a downward sweeping gesture of uncertainty that Celine\neither did not know how or did not bother to translate. Most of what I know\nabout who I am has come in just the last few months.\n“If you’re Dynize,” Orz asked, “how did you come to be in Fatrasta?”\nThat is one thing I’m still trying to discover.\n“But you know who you are?”\nMostly. I know who, but not why. I know that my nurse brought me out of\nDynize. She told me stories of wars and palaces whose names are lost to my\nmemory. She told me to fear other bone-eyes—to fear the men of the dragon\nand to fear the turquoise soldiers.\nCeline broke her translation for a moment and looked at Ka-poel\ncuriously. “Dragonmen and Dynize soldiers?”\nKa-poel nodded, giving Celine a sad smile before continuing on. I know\nthat my name is Ka-poel. I know that I have a sister named Mara. I also\nknow that my grandfather is the bone-eye you call Ka-Sedial.\nStyke looked sharply to Orz. The dragonman sank farther back on his\nhaunches, his chin lifting slightly to regard Ka-poel down the length of his\nnose. If anything, he seemed more wary than alarmed by this new\ninformation. “Ka-Sedial only has one granddaughter. Her name is\nIchtracia.”\nSay that name again.

There was an urgency to the gesture.\n“Ichtracia.”\nA small smile cracked Ka-poel’s weariness, and she went through a\nseries of gestures that Celine did not translate. It took Styke a moment to\nrealize that she was spelling out her sister’s name.\n“Her name isn’t Mara,” Orz said again.\nA nickname, Ka-poel explained. It’s all that I could recall. I’m not even\ncertain whether I heard it myself or my nurse told it to me. It’s been too\nlong. She spelled “Ichtracia” one more time with her fingers. Slowly.\nFondly. She wiped something away from the corner of her eye. I have\ngathered rumors from the Dynize that I’ve met. Some willingly. Others…\nnot. I have tried to piece together my own life. From what I know, Ka-Sedial\nhad his son and daughter-in-law murdered, along with two of their three\nchildren. Ichtracia is the third child.\nOrz settled back even farther until he was sitting, and he no longer\nlooked like a man performing an interrogation but a child listening to a\nstory. “There are rumors,” he said. “But no facts are known. Ka-Sedial’s\nson and his family disappeared long ago—all except Ichtracia. Supposedly\nthey were strangled and burned for some untold treachery. Ichtracia was the\nonly one spared.”\nI am one of those two other children that were said to have died.\nOrz pulled a very distinct impression of disbelief across his face. “That\nis quite a story.”\nDo you know anything else about it? About my past? Ka-poel leaned\nforward eagerly.\n“I don’t.” Orz made a noise in the back of his throat. “Like I said,\nrumors. What you’ve already heard is the unofficial story, and Ka-Sedial\nnever gave an official one.”\nDo you know who my parents were?\nOrz frowned. “Distantly. I know your mother fought on my side of the\ncivil war.” He snorted angrily. “Your mother.” He shook his head in\ndisbelief. “I take you at your word, yet this is too fantastic to believe.”\nFantastic or not, this is my life. I’ve never known what it meant. I still\ndon’t.\n“So what are you using these soldiers for?” Orz gestured around at the\nMad Lancer camp. “What hidden goals do you have? Which of them have\nyou seeped your influence into without their knowledge?” His voice began\nto rise, the cadence of his speech increasing.\nStyke took a long step forward, laying a hand on Celine’s shoulder.\n“That’s enough,” he said.\nOrz shot to his feet so quickly that Styke fell back into a defensive\nstance. The dragonman whirled on his heel and stalked into the night\nwithout another word, leaving Styke with a mixture of anger and relief. He\nlooked down at Ka-poel, who herself was staring in the direction that Orz\nhad gone.\n“Is this going to be a problem?” he asked.\nI don’t know, she gestured. I thought he already knew who I was.\n“I thought the same thing. But he didn’t, and telling him now hasn’t"

Even if he does, how can he\ntrust me? I am Ka-Sedial’s kin. Ka-poel frowned. I think this is a very\nconfusing time for him.\nStyke tapped the side of his lantern, staring off into the dark after Orz. “I\nreally hope he’s still here when we wake up in the morning.”\nCHAPTER 15\nV\nlora sat astride her horse, nodding gently into the morning sun,\ndesperately trying not to fall asleep as the distant beat of drums marked out\nthree full brigades of Adran soldiers falling into rank. Her head hurt from a\nnight without rest, her body ached from her wounds from the Crease, and\nher mind still wondered at the conversation with General Etepali the night\nbefore. She knew instinctively that she had missed something in the\nencounter and it clawed at the back of her brain.\n“Sleep well last night?” Bo asked cheerily, riding up beside her.\n“Not a wink. You?”\n“Like a baby. Nila brought a young captain back to the tent last night,\nand I’ll tell you…” Bo made the shape of a woman with his hands.\n“Please don’t,” Vlora cut him off. “And what the pit do you think you’re\ndoing, sleeping with my officers?”\n“It’s very boring here,” Bo said defensively. “Besides, it was Nila’s idea.\nShe figures we can, uh, spend time with someone from every regiment in\nthe entire army by the time this stupid thing is over.”\n“I hate you so much right now.” Vlora poured a bit of water from her\ncanteen onto a handkerchief and pressed it to her forehead. She knew about\nNila and Bo’s proclivity for play, of course—they were Privileged, after all,\nand had the libidos that went with their sorcerous power—but it served as a\nreminder that Olem had still not returned. She only now realized that the\nache of his absence had become almost physical, joining all of her wounds\nto a pulsing nest of pain in the back of her head. “Are you and Nila ready to\ndeal with anything they throw at us?”\nBo pursed his lips. “Odd, that.”\n“What is?”\n“We can’t find them.”\n“The enemy Privileged?”\n“Right. They’ve either left, or they’re very, very good at hiding.”\n“You’re out of practice. Talk to Norrine and Davd.”\n“Already did. They can’t find any Privileged, either.” He spread his\nhands. “There’s a lot of sorcerous noise over there—color left over from the\nDynize bombardment of New Adopest—but not enough to hide a bunch of\nPrivileged. There were eight yesterday, and now…”\n“Shit,” Vlora said under her breath. She searched the horizon, reaching\nfor her sorcery instinctively and clutching at nothing.

She beckoned\nover a messenger. “Send people to the First, Second, and Fifth. Tell them\nthat we don’t know when to expect a sorcerous barrage, and I’m holding\nour own power back to counter any surprises. They are to proceed with the\nbattle plan.”\nThe messenger bolted, and Vlora gestured to Bo to join his wife at the\nfront before settling back to watch the proceedings. Her left flank marched\nover the horizon to the north, swinging around the enemy earthworks with\nheavy cavalry support. Her right clung to the river in a tight column while\ntheir cannons rained down a withering cover fire on the Dynize artillery\nplatforms. The center, directly in front of her, ground forward in a line four-\ndeep, bayonets fixed, prepared to ford the river tributary as soon as pressure\nhad been applied to the flanks.\nVlora swept up and down the length of the river tributary with her\nlooking glass, that feeling of uncertainty still wedged in her gut. The Dynize\nreturned fire with their heavy guns, but by the time her men reached the\ntributary, she had the odd feeling that the return fire was too sporadic, that\nthere wasn’t enough movement on those earthworks.\nIt was with some surprise that she saw her own cavalry sweeping down\nthe length of those earthworks before her center had even reached the other\nside of the river. The cavalry galloped over a handful of Dynize, swept\nthrough multiple artillery platforms, and then rode out of sight beyond the\nearthworks. Her soldiers crossed the river and followed them without a\nsingle scrap of resistance from the enemy line.\nMessengers soon came flooding back to her, all of them with the same\nstory: only a token resistance. A few hundred Dynize soldiers threw down\ntheir weapons the moment the Adran infantry arrived. There was no sign of\nGeneral Etepali, her officer corps, her Privileged sorcerers, or the main\nbody of her army.\nThe Dynize were gone.\nVlora walked through the Dynize camp, the seeds of their deception\nunfolding before her eyes.\nIt was clear that most of them had already been gone by the time she met\nwith General Etepali last night. Every third tent had been left standing, and\nall the campfires stoked just enough to smolder. It was shockingly clean—\nthe Dynize had taken everything with them but the tents—evidence of an\nordered withdrawal rather than a frantic retreat. The withdrawal had forded\nthe river within sight of New Adopest, but around the bend from Vlora and\nher troops.\nExhaustion tugged at her shoulders, slowed her feet, but Vlora was\ngalvanized by her anger. She strode around the camp in wider and wider\ncircles, ignoring the soldiers who stared at her as she passed, swearing\nunder her breath.\nOn her third circle, she ran directly into General Sabastenien and his\nbodyguard. Sabastenien was dismounted, examining the ground at his feet.\nHe shook his head as Vlora approached, said something to one of his\nbodyguards, and came to meet her. “Ma’am.”\n“It’s the same damn thing.”\n“Excuse me, ma’am?”"

This was why I couldn’t sleep last night. I had\nan inkling of what was happening, but I just couldn’t put the pieces\ntogether.” Vlora was angry at everything—her officers, her scouts, the\nenemy, and especially at herself. “Your cavalry. Were they ever able to gain\nground south of the river last night?”\nSabastenien pulled a wry face. “They just reported in. They met stern\nresistance until dark, then pulled back and conducted a night crossing after\nmidnight. When morning came, it was like the enemy had never been there.\nExcept…”\n“Except what?”\n“Evidence of a mass exodus. Easily thirty thousand men. They must\nhave crossed the river over the last few days and headed west while we\nwere heading east.”\n“Yeah,” Vlora said crossly, “I figured as much.” Everything came into\nfocus. The tributary bridges had been left standing to give Vlora an easy\nride on purpose. Had they been burned, she would have taken a longer time\ngetting to New Adopest—she would have spread out her forces to look for a\nbetter route and been more insistent about scouting south of the river and\ncaught wind of their retreat. Those cavalry she saw crossing yesterday\nafternoon must have been the tail end of their forces. “Why?” she\ndemanded, half to herself. “Why would Etepali slip away when she had\nsuch a good defensive position?”\nSabastenien clasped his hands behind his back. “If she only had thirty\nthousand, and she knew the size of our force and our offshore fleet, then she\nwas wise not to allow a confrontation here. Slip around us, head back to the\nmainland. She loses New Adopest, but she puts herself in position to be\nreinforced by the rest of the Dynize Army.”\nA messenger approached, starting when he saw the look on Vlora’s face.\n“What is it?” she snapped.\n“Sorry, ma’am. One of the Dynize soldiers. He had a note for you.”\nVlora snatched the note from the messenger and broke the seal. It was\nwritten in Adran in a gorgeous, flowing hand in crimson ink.\nMy dear Vlora. It was a pleasure to meet you last night. I’m sorry for\nthe deception, but I felt I was not prepared to face you in open battle\nat such a disadvantage. I’ll save the rest of the whiskey. I do hope we\nhave an opportunity to share it one day, regardless of the outcome of\nour next meeting. Best, Etepali\nVlora crumpled the letter and dropped it, pinching the bridge of her\nnose. “Used my own tactic against me and I didn’t even see it coming.”\nShe heard horses and looked up to find Bo and Nila approaching at a\ntrot. The two Privileged dismounted, and it was Nila who came to Vlora’s\nside and picked up the letter she’d dropped. She read it silently and handed\nit to Bo."

She read it silently and handed\nit to Bo.\n“If you laugh, Privileged Borbador, I will shoot you in the face,” Vlora\nsaid.\nBo turned a chuckle into a cough, then began to hack and spit. “I would\nnever,” he said when he recovered.\n“This isn’t funny.”\n“It’s kind of funny.”\n“No, it’s not. I now have the most decorated general in Dynize at my\nback. She’s put herself in a position to block my progress off the Cape and\nbring in reinforcements. What’s more, I missed what should have been an\nobvious deception.”\n“We all have bad days,” Bo suggested.\n“My bad days get people killed.”\nSabastenien cleared his throat. “Ma’am, I understand we’ve received\nmessengers from the city. They’re hailing us as liberators and have asked\nthat you come meet with the mayor.”\n“I don’t have time,” Vlora said. “Get everyone turned around. I want\nyou to take command of our combined cavalry and head upriver. See if you\ncan get in front of Etepali’s army. Harry them. Slow them down.”\n“We’re going after her?”\n“Yes. I’m not going to let her get reinforcements, not if I can help it.”\n“What about the prisoners?”\nThe words “execute them” floated on the tip of Vlora’s tongue. The\nterrible urge rooted in her belly almost pushed them out, but she managed to\nchoke them off. “Hand them over to the city garrison of New Adopest.”\n“And the city?”\n“Strip their granaries and munitions. Take everything we might need to\nfight our way to Landfall.”\nSabastenien’s eyes widened. “We’re sacking the city?”\n“Not a sack,” Vlora replied. “Keep the men in line, but requisition\neverything. If they disagree, signal the fleet to fire a few salvos at their\nharbor.” This was it—the second lesson she needed to teach both her allies\nand her enemies: that Fatrastans were not their friends. The Adran Army\nwas not here to liberate. They were here to accomplish a task. “Get to it,\nGeneral. I want you at the head of our cavalry and after the Dynize within\nthe hour.”\nCHAPTER 16\nM\nichel didn’t like the idea of leaving Greenfire Depths. Through some\ncruel corruption of the laws of nature and in defiance of common sense, it\nhad become the safest spot for him in Landfall. He climbed out of its\nstinking, twisted embrace with reluctance and joined the morning traffic\nheading east across the plateau, wearing thick cotton laborer’s trousers, a\nvest, and a wide-brimmed straw farmer’s hat to shade—and hide—his face.\nHe let the crowd pull him along, nudging his own trajectory every\ncouple of blocks until he’d navigated to Proctor, not far from where his\nmother had lived before she’d been whisked inland by Taniel’s agents. He\nwondered, not for the first time, where she was and how she was doing. He\nwondered if she’d forgiven him for all those years of making her think he\nwas a Blackhat stooge."

        "text": "wondered, not for the first time, where she was and how she was doing. He\nwondered if she’d forgiven him for all those years of making her think he\nwas a Blackhat stooge.\nMichel slipped down the basement stairs of a large tenement near the\nedge of the plateau, trudging the length of a musty hall until he reached the\nlast door on the left. The lock had, by some miracle, not been smashed, and\nthe door showed no signs of tampering. He let himself in with a key hidden\nbehind a loose brick. The single-room apartment was lit by one rectangular\nwindow not much bigger than his head, and the air was thick and full of\ncobwebs.\nIt took him just a couple of minutes to move the mattress out of the\ncorner, lift the dusty old rug beneath it, then find the knots in the\nfloorboards that allowed him to pull them up, revealing a hidden cubby that\ncould, in an emergency, fit a person. It currently contained a handful of\nTaniel’s old fake passports, a few thousand krana in cash, and a long map\ncase that he’d stolen from the Yaret Household after the successful search of\nthe Landfall catacombs.\nHe took some of the cash, ignored the passports, and then spent the next\nhour examining those old maps of the catacombs. Once he was satisfied, he\ncopied down a bit of one of the maps and then stowed them back in their\noriginal spot, leaving the place exactly as he had found it.\nHe returned to Greenfire Depths and picked up Ichtracia from their\nshared apartment before heading to Meln-Dun’s quarry to meet his fellow\nhunters.\nThe crew was in good spirits and, at Michel’s orders, headed out into the\nDepths to spread around bribe money and listen for rumors. Michel\npocketed a thick wad of petty cash and Dynize rations cards from Dahre.\nHe led Ichtracia out into the street, down along the river, and then into one\nof the tenements that the two of them were meant to be searching. He\nwaited inside for several minutes, watching the street behind them through\na crack in the tenement wall.\n“What are we doing?” Ichtracia asked.\n“We’re making sure no one is following us.”\n“You think they would?”\n“I don’t,” Michel said reassuringly, “but better safe than sorry. Okay, I\nthink we’re fine. Follow me.” They went up two levels and then left the\ntenement for the spiderweb of the Depths. Even with a working—if dated—\nmap of the quarry in his head, Michel got them lost three times before he\nfound their destination: a tall building, almost entirely still in one piece,\nnear the very center of the Depths.\n“We’re here,” Michel announced.\n“What is here?” Ichtracia asked skeptically.\nMichel rapped on the door. A peephole opened and a pair of eyes stared\nout at them. “Do you have an appointment?”\n“I don’t,” Michel said, “but I do have this.” He counted off exactly\neighty-three krana in Adran bills and held it up to the peephole. It was\nsnatched quickly and the hole closed. “This,” he told Ichtracia quietly, “is\nthe home of the most successful Palo arms dealer in Fatrasta. Don’t say"

Just look menacing.” He held up one finger to qualify that\nstatement. “But not too menacing.”\nThe door opened suddenly, and they were greeted by the smiling face of\na Gurlish hunchback. The man bobbed his head twice. “Up the stairs,” he\ninstructed, pointing them toward a narrow staircase. “All the way to the\ntop.”\nMichel frowned at the narrow lift beside the stairs. A sign on the lift\ndoor said, OUT OF ORDER. He shrugged and nodded to Ichtracia. They began\ntheir climb.\nThey were on the sixth floor when he heard the very distinctive hum of a\nsteam-powered engine somewhere in the bowels of the building. They\nreached the eighth floor at almost the exact same moment as the lift. The\nhunchback doorman stepped out, gave them a cheeky smile and a bow, and\nopened the door for them. Michel paused to catch his breath, nodded, and\nstepped out into the sun.\nThe roof was a narrow bit of gently sloped shingling that rose higher\nthan almost all the other buildings in the Depths—almost to the rim of\nUpper Landfall. A man lay out nude on a blanket, his face covered with a\nwashcloth and the rest of him bared to the sun. His freckles were thick and\ndark, his skin as wrinkly as a prune. He might have been a hard-living\nforty-year-old or an exceptionally fit octogenarian. Michel did not know,\nnor did anyone else who worked with him. Their host raised the washcloth\nas they stepped onto his roof, then lowered it back over his eyes.\n“Afternoon,” Michel said. “You’re Halifin?” He’d met Halifin on three\ndifferent occasions, of course. But Halifin didn’t need to know that.\n“Have we met before?” the supine figure asked.\n“We haven’t,” Michel said. He didn’t bother introducing Ichtracia to the\narms dealer or the arms dealer to Ichtracia. This was a business where\nnames didn’t matter. “I need to put in an order.”\n“If we’ve never met, how did you know where to find me?” Halifin\nmuttered from beneath his washcloth.\nMichel tensed involuntarily, stealing a glance over his shoulder at the\nhunchback. The fool still had that big grin on his face, but a pistol had\nappeared in his hand. He didn’t point it at anything; rather, just let it hang\nloosely there. Ichtracia’s eyes tightened, and Michel gave her a slight shake\nof his head. “I was recommended,” he offered.\n“Of course you were,” Halifin said. “All my new friends are\nrecommended.” The hunchback’s pistol disappeared as quickly as if it were\na magic trick. “What can I do for you?” Halifin asked. Never once did he\ntouch the washcloth over his face, or attempt to cover his nudity.\nMichel produced the map he’d copied of a little corner of the Landfall\ncatacombs from his pocket, then wrapped it in a wad of Adran krana.

        "text": "Michel produced the map he’d copied of a little corner of the Landfall\ncatacombs from his pocket, then wrapped it in a wad of Adran krana. He\nhanded it to the hunchback. “I need twelve crates of Hrusch rifles delivered\nto this spot by tomorrow night.”\n“You’re sure I don’t know you?” The voice was almost playful.\n“I’m sure,” Michel replied flatly. “Do I have an order?”\nHalifin sniffed. “Hrusch rifles are in steep demand. The Dynize are\nbuying them up like kids in a candy store. Trying to update their arms.”\nMichel reached into his pocket and produced another thousand krana in\na tight, folded clip. He handed it to the hunchback. “Does that cover it?”\nNo apparent signal passed between the hunchback and Halifin, but the\nlatter yawned loudly. “Yes, I do believe so.” He waved his hand, and the\nhunchback gave him both the money and the map. Halifin lifted the corner\nof his washcloth with one hand, unfolded the map with the other. “Behind\nMeln-Dun’s quarry? Are you working for that old hawk?”\nMichel gave him a shallow smile. “Is the delivery location a problem?”\n“No, it shouldn’t be. Nobody likes going into the catacombs since the\nDynize cleaned them out last month. It’ll be a good spot to stash the guns.”\n“Wonderful.” Michel tipped his hat and wished Halifin a good\nafternoon. He refused a ride on the lift from the hunchback and waited until\nthey were back down in the street—or what passed for a street in this\nneighborhood—before letting out a relieved sigh. He loosened his collar a\nlittle and wiped a bit of sweat from his brow.\n“Did we just buy guns from a naked man?” Ichtracia asked, staring back\ntoward the door.\n“We did,” Michel confirmed, taking a mental inventory of how much\nmoney he still had left in his pocket.\n“Why are we buying guns for Meln-Dun?” Ichtracia asked.\n“Think about it,” Michel answered, his own thoughts already moving on\nto the next several steps of his plan.\n“This is how you’re going to make him a martyr?”\n“One part of it, yes.”\n“Are you going to explain that?”\n“No.” He saw her annoyed expression and spread his hands.\n“Compartmentalization. If you’re captured, I don’t need to worry about\nother parts of my plan coming apart.”\n“If I’m captured, you’d be smart not to stick around for more than a few\nseconds,” Ichtracia pointed out.\n“You’re probably right. But I haven’t survived this long without a little\ncaution.” He shook his head. “Look, this may sound silly, but I do best not\nthinking too hard about my own plans.”\n“You’re worried about someone overhearing your thoughts?”\n“I keep myself”—he tapped his chest—“the real me, buried deep. When\nI worked for the Blackhats, I refused to even think Taniel’s name. It’s not\nabout hiding my thoughts. It’s about being as much of the person others\nexpect me to be as possible.

We’re already\nworking a hundred times faster than I would have preferred, with you\nlearning to govern your accent on the fly.” He shook his head. “We better\nget back to our posts. Pretend we’ve gotten some work done.”\nThey returned to their canvassing area. Michel put Ichtracia just behind\nhim so she could watch how he worked, and fixed a gentle smile on his\nface. Starting at one end of the street, he began to move down it at a\nleisurely pace. He slapped men on the shoulders as if they were old friends,\ngently touched women on the elbow, meeting everyone’s eyes with a\npleasant smile and a quiet word. “Hey there, I’m looking for someone,”\nhe’d say, slipping a two-krana note into a hand. “Someone who goes by\n‘Mama Palo.’ Any idea where I can find her?”\n“No,” came the answer. “I heard she was dead,” or “Not gonna find her\nanymore, she went up north.” Occasionally someone would turn away, or\nleave quickly after Michel passed. He’d note their face but keep moving.\nHours went by and Ichtracia had just begun to work the other side of the\nstreet on her own when Michel spotted a familiar face jumping through the\ncrowd, waving at him. It was Couhila. The old man’s face was alight with a\ngrin. “We found her!” he babbled before he’d even reached Michel. “Dahre\nhas called a meeting. We have to head back!”\nMichel forced a surprised smile onto his face and subtly waved off\nIchtracia’s alarmed expression. “Shit, shit, shit, shit,” he muttered under his\nbreath. Already? What kind of horribly rotten luck was this? His heart\nstarted thumping as worries shuffled through his head. What if they’d\ncaptured her already? Pit, what if they’d killed her? He widened his grin as\nCouhila got close. “That’s fantastic,” he forced himself to say, gesturing for\nIchtracia to join them. “Let’s get back quickly!”\nThey followed Couhila back to Meln-Dun’s quarry and up to Dahre’s\noffice, where the rest of the group had already gathered. There was a\nnervous energy in the room, and Dahre had the sort of well-earned smirk\nthat Michel himself might have been wearing in the same situation. For a\nfew moments he forgot where he was—for a few moments these were the\ngood guys, his allies, celebrating an imminent victory. Michel held on to the\nfeeling, accepting the comradeship, holding his gnawing fear at bay.\n“All right, all right,” Dahre said, motioning for them to quiet down. “We\nhaven’t caught her yet.”\nMichel suppressed a sigh of relief.\nDahre continued, “But the canvassing has turned up the best lead we’ve\nhad so far.” He crossed the room to pluck one of the sketches off the wall of\nMama Palo’s known associates and waved it in the air. “This man, Kelinar,\nis a minor lieutenant of Mama Palo’s.

He took the bait.”\nDevin-Mezi looked smug enough that you’d think she’d captured Mama\nPalo already. Michel did his best not to roll his eyes, and focused on the\nsketch. The name Kelinar was vaguely familiar in a distant way, as was the\nface. Perhaps they’d crossed paths briefly at some point, or maybe he’d\nspotted the face on a list of criminals wanted by the Blackhats. As far as\nMichel knew, he wasn’t someone very high up in Mama Palo’s organization\n—but that might have changed, or he might just be in the right position to\noffer up his employer.\n“What does he know?” Michel asked.\n“He knows where Mama Palo is, how many guards she has, and even\nthe room she’s sleeping in.” Dahre grinned. “He says she’s about to change\nsafe houses and that he can deliver us the location of the next one. If he\ndoes… we’ve as good as got her.”\n“Good, good,” Michel said out loud. Inwardly he continued to swear.\nBeside him, Ichtracia wasn’t nearly as good at hiding her true feelings. She\nwas forcing a smile but looked vaguely alarmed. He hoped no one noticed.\nHe was working through options with that desperation that he’d only\nrecently warned Ichtracia was a bad way to operate as a spy. He might have\nto find this turncoat and silence him, or dig out Mama Palo himself to warn\nher.\nNone of this was how things were supposed to go down.\n“Do we have him in custody?” Michel asked.\nDahre shook his head. “We had to cut him loose or his friends would get\nsuspicious. He’s going to report back tonight. At least, if he wants his\nmoney, he will.”\n“Did he say where they are?”\n“Not until he gets paid.”\nMichel forced himself to breathe evenly. The turncoat might get cold\nfeet and never come back. Or pit, he might be conning Dahre. He hoped it\nwas one of these options. He wasn’t ready to move against Meln-Dun yet,\nand he certainly couldn’t afford to lose Mama Palo and her resources before\nhe’d even made contact with her.\n“How long until we move against her?”\n“Our new friend said she’s going to move tonight and settle into her new\nsafe house tomorrow. We give her a little bit of time to get complacent.\nThree days, I think.”\nMichel tried to think of a good argument to delay their actions further,\nbut came up with nothing. He nodded lamely. “When he comes back, we’ll\nwant to give him a good interrogation. Nothing violent, mind, but put the\nscrews to him. Make sure we’re getting exactly what we paid for.”\n“Good call,” Dahre agreed. “Couhila, can you deal with that?”\n“Of course,” the old man said.\nMichel almost swore out loud.

He let the others talk,\nhalf listening as everyone suggested interrogation tactics, questions for the\nturncoat, and how best to surround and isolate Mama Palo’s position. At the\nfirst chance he got, he took Ichtracia off to one side.\n“What the pit are we going to do?” she hissed. “If they kill her…”\n“We’ll deal with that if we have to. In the meantime, I’ve got work to\ndo.

She could feel an\nenergy about her soldiers—a feeling of being cheated out of a battle, an\neagerness to match bayonets with the Dynize that she herself shared.\nRumors swirled that the Dynize were afraid of Vlora, and that seemed to\nput the soldiers in good spirits. From the gossip she heard through Bo’s\ninformants in her own army, they considered Landfall—and the godstone—\nalready won.\nShe knew that the morale of a marching army was a fickle thing, but she\nalso knew better than to squander it while it lasted.\nHer own mind dragged, and her body was full of aches and pains that\nshe couldn’t get rid of. She’d learned very quickly that despite her powder\nblindness, liquor still had very little effect on her senses—it took several\nbottles of wine to feel even slightly woozy. A small part of her held out\nhope that this was a sign that the condition was not permanent. A much\nlarger part of her spat with fury that there was nothing to take the edge off\nher anguish.\nShe hid all of it behind a carefully constructed mask that allowed her to\nface her soldiers without tears in her eyes. She turned that mask on\nBorbador when he approached her late in the afternoon while she watched\nher men. After two hard days of quick marching they were beginning to\nflag.\n“How are you holding up?” he asked, letting his horse fall in beside\nhers.\n“Alive,” she responded.\n“Well, that’s a relief.” He didn’t press the question. “Odd thing to ask,\nbut are you getting proper reports from your officers?”\nVlora shook off her ennui and gave him a sharp glance. “Why?”\nHe shrugged. “Just curious. Everyone seems to be stepping pretty softly\naround you.”\n“I don’t know,” she said with frustration. “Olem usually acts as a liaison\nbetween me and… well, most everyone else.”\n“He’s not here.”\n“Yes, I know.” She didn’t hold back the anger she felt at the statement.\nOlem should be here.

But you probably should know that sort of thing anyway.” Bo\nchewed on his lip. “Look, I’m not going to fill in as a liaison for you and\neveryone else like Olem, but I am going to make sure you get a full report\nof important things.”\n“How is the New Adopest mayor important?”\n“He’s the mayor of a major city that your fleet is in the process of\nsacking.”\n“I’m not sacking it. I’m requisitioning from it.”\n“Against their will.”\n“That’s how requisitioning often works.”\nBo rolled his eyes. “It’s near enough the same thing in their eyes, and\ndon’t pretend like you don’t know it. They were on the edge of capitulating\nwhen we arrived. Few stores, ammunition and medical supplies low. We’re\ntaking what little they have left.”\nVlora wrestled with the idea, trying to summon that persistent fury to\nquash all sympathy. Was she doing the right thing? Winters in Fatrasta were\npractically balmy compared to Adro, but they were on the cusp of it, which\nmeant a long time until another harvest. Was she leaving those people to\nstarve if the war didn’t break? She hardened her heart, staving off the\nquestions swirling in her mind. She was trying to save the world from\nanother god. Sacrifices must be made.\n“Since when did your heart start bleeding?” she shot at Bo.\n“This isn’t bleeding-heart shit,” Bo retorted. “This is commanding-\nofficer shit. You need to know these things and consider them with every\ndecision. I’m pretty sure we both learned that from the same person.”\nVlora’s hand went protectively to her saddlebags, where Tamas’s journal\nwas close at hand. “Don’t do that,” she said quietly.\nBo glared hard for a few moments before relenting. “Sorry.”\nThey rode in silence for some time before Vlora ran a hand through her\nsweaty hair and called to a messenger. “Word for the fleet,” she told the\nboy. “Tell them to go light on the requisitioning. Leave the city grain—but\ntake all the munitions we can get our hands on.”\nThe boy snapped a salute and was off.\nShe glanced at Bo, who was studying his saddle horn. He’d said his\npiece. She’d relented a little. Life would go on. “Davd,” she called over her\nshoulder.\nThe powder mage left his casual guardsman’s position a few dozen\npaces behind them and rode up to join them. “Yes, ma’am?”\n“Have we heard from Olem?”\nDavd went pale. “No, ma’am.”\nVlora scowled at the reaction. “What do you mean, ‘no’?”"

He accompanied the godstone capstone and our wounded weeks ago.\nBut we haven’t heard from him?”\nDavd was visibly sweating now. It made no sense. Had something\nhappened to Olem? Were they hiding it from her? The whole thought was\ninconceivable. “Davd,” she said sharply. “What’s going on?”\n“Nothing, ma’am. We just haven’t heard from him.”\nBo nudged his horse back, then around to the other side of Davd.\n“Probably best if you just come out and say whatever it is you have to say,”\nhe said gently.\nDavd looked over his shoulder, swallowed, and finally met Vlora’s eyes.\nHe was no coward—she knew that from all the fighting they’d gone\nthrough together—but he was still young and he’d always gotten nervous\nbefore her moods. He cleared his throat. “Olem dropped the capstone off to\nour fleet several weeks ago,” he said.\n“And?”\n“And the wounded.”\nVlora was getting impatient. “And where is he?” she hissed.\n“No one knows.” Davd looked away again. “He left his uniforms with\nhis travel chest on one of the ships, took a horse, and disappeared. The last\ntime anyone saw him, he was riding west. They thought he was coming\nback to join us. We scoured the countryside for him—no sign of him or his\nhorse.”\nVlora couldn’t comprehend what Davd was saying. “He left?” she asked\ndully.\n“Yes, ma’am.”\n“Did he say anything? Tell anyone where he was going?”\n“No, ma’am.”\nVlora could see on both Bo’s and Davd’s faces that there was more to\nthe story—Davd because he knew it, and Bo because he’d figured it out.\nShe wanted to lean across and shake answers out of them both, but there\nwas a sudden fear in the pit of her stomach. Did she want those answers?\nThis sounded like Olem had abandoned his commission. He would never.\nShe refused to believe it.\n“What happened to Olem?” she asked Davd, trying—and failing—to\nkeep her voice steady.\nDavd looked like he wanted to be swallowed up by the earth.\n“Does everyone else know?” Vlora demanded. “Is this some joke among\nthe army? Some secret to keep from the general?”\n“No, ma’am.”\n“Then, what is it?”\n“I can’t know for sure, ma’am.”\n“Guess.”\nDavd looked around one more time before he took a deep breath and\nswallowed hard. “The colonel was furious after the Crease, ma’am. I’ve\nnever seen him so angry. He broke an infantryman’s arm, knocked the teeth\nout of another. It took eight men to restrain him when he found out that you\nwere back there holding the Crease on your own.”"

It took eight men to restrain him when he found out that you\nwere back there holding the Crease on your own.”\nThe sensation in Vlora’s stomach grew more defined. Her heart\nhammered in her chest.\n“The only thing that brought him back to his senses was the arrival of\nthe Adran Army. Bo and Nila swore to him that they’d do everything in\ntheir power to save you, but I think the damage had been done by then. He\nwouldn’t even go with them to help. He just fell into a silent fury. It was\nscarier than when he was breaking arms. He stuck around just long enough\nto find out that you’d pull through. Then he took the wounded and the\ncapstone to the fleet.”\nVlora ran through a thousand rationales in her head, trying to stave off\nthe rising panic. “Damage?” she echoed, her own voice sounding ghostly.\n“What damage was done?”\n“You betrayed him, ma’am.” Davd met her eyes this time. He was dead\nserious.\nThe only thing Vlora had to curb her panic was fury. She let it loose, let\nit catch her under the arms and lift her into the air. “Leave,” she whispered.\n“You had him attacked and trundled off like a sack of potatoes,” Davd\nwent on, his voice getting stronger. “You’re the woman he loves and you\nwouldn’t even let him die by your side. It was too much for him. He\nsnapped.”\n“You should go now,” Vlora said louder.\n“I don’t think he’s coming back,” Davd said.\n“Get out of my sight!” The words tore themselves from Vlora’s throat,\nand she found herself standing in her stirrups, sword half-drawn. Davd\nkneed his horse and leapt forward, tearing off to join the column. She barely\nnoticed him going, staring at the pommel of her sword. She jerked\nunnecessarily hard on the reins, brought her horse to a stop, and turned\naway from Bo and the column and anyone else who might be able to see her\nface.\nOlem was gone. How could any of this be worth it anymore?\nCHAPTER 18\nM\nichel returned to the forlorn safe house in the basement of the tenement\nin Proctor. It was a brief visit—just long enough to find the passport given\nto him by the Yaret Household during his time in their service. While it did\nidentify him as a member of the Yaret Household, it didn’t give his name. It\nshould be just enough to get him out of a tight situation if necessary.\nHe returned to his apartment in Greenfire Depths and fell asleep early\nbeside Ichtracia, where he dreamed of betrayal, prisons, and torture. When\nhe awoke in a cold sweat, his pocket watch told him that it was almost two\nin the morning. He dressed silently, careful not to wake Ichtracia, and\nheaded out into the Depths on his own.\nThe Depths at night hadn’t changed one bit—it was still a dangerous\nplace, even for Palo, and he kept his ears tuned for following footsteps and\nhis eyes darting for movement in dark alleyways.

The important thing was\nthat he was more worried about thieves than he was about Dynize agents. It\nwasn’t until he reached Upper Landfall that his nerves began to fray. The\nstreets here were all but empty, trafficked by Dynize patrols and couriers on\nofficial business. The curfew had grown more severe since his last night. He\nwas stopped three times on his trip across the plateau, and with each one he\nwas able to present the passport and move on without question.\nThe capital building was dark, guarded by a small number of bored-\nlooking sentries in their colorful uniforms and steel breastplates. He waited\nand watched, making sure that someone—anyone—still used the big\nbuilding this late at night so that his presence wouldn’t be out of place.\nOnce he’d seen a handful of tired clerks and slumping messengers come\nand go, he allowed himself to approach.\nThe Yaret Household passport worked without a second glance from the\nsentries. Michel was soon inside, walking quickly down the marble halls,\nhis footsteps echoing softly. A few gas lamps splashed long streaks of\nflickering light, deepening the shadows and giving the Dynize flags,\nHousehold regalia, and military colors a sinister feel.\nHe passed only the occasional person as he navigated the long halls—\nthe same late-night sorts he’d seen outside, in addition to a handful of\nmaids, janitors, and guards carrying out their nightly routines. None of them\ngave him a second glance, and he was soon heading down the stairs into the\nbowels of the building.\nThese stairs did not hold good memories for him—the last time he’d\ndescended this way, he was following a woman who he thought was a\nmember of Yaret’s Household. She’d beaten him severely before Yaret had\nmanaged to find him. Michel had taken his revenge, but he could still feel\nthe strike of her blackjack against the base of his neck.\nHe descended three flights of stairs. There were no windows to show the\nmoonlight down here, and the few lit lamps were tokens to guide lost clerks\nrather than any real effort to conquer the darkness. He was glad for the\nechoing loneliness of it, and took extra care to muffle his steps. The last\nthing he needed was some helpful guard discovering him this far beneath\nthe more trafficked areas of the building.\nHe found a series of rooms by virtue of his memories of their description\n—another benefit of his time with the Yaret Household. Under the Lindet\nregime, these had been filing rooms, a place to put intelligence and\ninformation until the professionals could sort out their importance. The\nDynize had seen no need to change their original function. Yaret’s people\nhad brought thousands of cases of files down here, all of them recovered\nfrom various corners of Landfall, most from Blackhat archives and safe\nhouses. The files had been considered important enough to keep, but not\nimportant enough to work through with any urgency.\nEach door was marked with big block numbering and a small placard\nthat listed the location from which the contents had been scrounged.

Some\nof the rooms held files from several dozen locations, while others contained\ninformation from just one or two places. He tapped each placard gently as\nhe found it, whispering the names to himself until he reached one that\nsimply said, MILLINERY. FIRST FLOOR.\nThe old Blackhat headquarters at the millinery had been an important\nsource of information for the Dynize, but most of the good stuff had come\nfrom the third floor. The first floor had contained little more than public and\nlightly classified records.\nHe opened the door, slipping inside and locating the gas lamps by the\ntiny glow of their pilot lights. He turned them up, one by one, until the\nentire room was well lit, revealing hundreds of filing cabinets. A quick\nsearch showed that half of them had been marked by some efficient Dynize\nclerk. The other half were a jumbled, unsorted mess. He prayed that what he\nneeded was in that first half.\nMichel bent to his work, muttering to himself as he went. Despite\nLindet’s hasty exit and the Dynize reorganization, he was fairly confident\nthat the files he needed were here. All he had to do was figure out which\ncabinet they’d been stuffed in.\nHe worked methodically, starting with the labeled boxes and perusing\npapers for names, dates, and anything that might help him narrow down his\nsearch. There was method to the madness of both the original Blackhat\nclerks and the Dynize. It took him over an hour to confidently surmise how\nthose two systems had been shuffled. It was another hour and a half before\nhe’d found the right corner of the room, and then one more after that when\nhe finally put his hands on a file labeled Lady Flint Landfall Operation.\nHe checked it thoroughly, making sure he had the right thing, then\npulled out his pocket watch. Almost six in the morning. Well past time to\nleave if he wanted to be gone before the morning rush. He rounded the\nroom, careful to remove any evidence that anyone had been here during the\nnight.\nHe was just about to head to the door when he heard whistling,\naccompanied by the low, unsteady sound of someone walking with a limp.\nMichel swore under his breath, rushing around the room, turning off the\nlamps. He’d just dimmed the last one and ducked behind a row of boxes\nwhen the whistling stopped outside the door. Several moments passed.\nMichel held his breath, waiting, until the door finally opened to cast a light\nacross the now-dark room.\nSomeone entered and crossed to the opposite side of the room in the\ndarkness. Michel took the opportunity to slip out of his hiding spot and pad\ntoward the door. He was almost there when a lamp flared to life behind him\nand a firm voice called out in Dynize, “You there! Stop!”\nMichel froze, considering his options. His back was still to the stranger.\nHe could make a run for it and risk that the guards wouldn’t hear any\nyelling this deep in the building. Or he could try to talk his way out of\nthings. He wondered if his passport would be enough to silence any\nquestions. It depended entirely on the person behind him—whether they\nwere a low-level clerk or someone more important."

It depended entirely on the person behind him—whether they\nwere a low-level clerk or someone more important.\nAt this hour? They were likely a low-level clerk here for a mundane job.\nMichel fixed his best Why are you bothering me? expression and turned to\nface the stranger.\nHis expression disappeared in an instant, and Michel had to struggle to\nhide the shock that replaced it. The man behind him was bald, lean, and\nshort. He wore a cotton suit in the Fatrastan style, but he was most\ndefinitely a Dynize. He frowned at Michel for a moment, clearly confused.\nIt took several seconds for a flicker of recognition to pass behind his eyes\nand his mouth to fall open.\n“Michel?”\nMichel swallowed hard. “Tenik.” The two stared at each other from\nacross the room. Michel considered making a run for it. Tenik clearly\ncouldn’t keep up—his left leg was dragging badly and his left arm was in a\nsling. But how close were the capital-building guards? Would they be able\nto hear his shouts before Michel had slipped safely into the streets? “Not\nexactly a place I expected to find you.”\n“Nor I, you.” Tenik’s expression hardened. “What are you doing here?”\nMichel didn’t answer. Tenik probably didn’t expect one. He let his eyes\ntravel across Tenik’s left side. The last time he saw Yaret’s cupbearer was\nright before an explosion had separated them in the catacombs almost two\nmonths ago. “Your arm…,” he said lamely.\n“The explosion,” Tenik explained. “I’m unable to move like I once\ncould, so Yaret has made me an archivist. My job is to oversee all of this.”\nHis eyes wandered briefly across the lines of cabinets. “We’re sorting\nthrough it. Trying to find anything of use.”\nMichel gripped the files in his hand. “Best of luck with that. There’s a\nlot to go through.”\n“I see you’ve been making use of it.” Tenik’s eyes flashed to those files.\n“Yaret figured you might come back at some point.”\n“Here?” Michel asked in surprise.\n“Not necessarily. But to the city. He said that you’re too attached to\nLandfall. That your expertise is here, and you’ll want to use it.”\nMichel frowned.\n“We found your file,” Tenik said\n“Ah.” Michel’s Blackhat file. He’d never actually seen it himself, but he\ncould guess what was in it—highly classified information about his\nundercover operations. A handful of commendations that no one but him\nand two or three Blackhat Gold Roses had ever actually known about. He\nwondered if his file had information about those last few weeks before the\nDynize invasion, or if his tasks for Fidelis Jes had been lost in the chaos. He\nhoped the latter. The less anyone knew about him and his actions, the better.\n“We knew you were a spy,” Tenik said, “but it was interesting to see\nwhat you’d done for the Blackhats. Your transition from spy to bureaucrat.\nBut you never stopped being a spy, did you?”\nAgain, Michel didn’t answer.\nThe surprise left Tenik’s voice, replaced with a firm note of"

Sedial himself was screaming about how he had proof that you\nwere still working for the enemy, and Yaret could not protect you.”\n“Sedial ambushed me at Ichtracia’s. Tortured me.”\n“Sounds like he was right to do so,” Tenik snorted. “How the pit did you\nescape?”\nMichel scowled. If Tenik didn’t know about Ichtracia’s involvement,\nMichel wasn’t about to tell him.\n“So, did you leave Landfall?” Tenik asked after a moment of silence.\n“My bet was that you never left—that you’d slipped off to hide someplace\nthat we wouldn’t think to look.”\n“I did leave. For a while.”\n“But you’re back.”\nThe tension grew thicker. Michel resisted the urge to look toward the\ndoor so as not to betray his next move. He needed to run, but his feet felt\nglued in place. “Yes.”\nThere was more to the injuries in Tenik’s body language. He seemed\ntired, his face haggard and his shoulders slumped in defeat. He looked at\nMichel, then at the door, then limped over to a chair in the corner and sank\ndown into it with a grateful sigh. “Ka-Sedial has made you an enemy of the\nstate. Claims that you’re still working for the Blackhats.”\n“He knows I’m not,” Michel replied before he could stop himself.\n“So do we,” Tenik said. “Problem is, none of us at the Household have\nbeen able to figure out who you are working for. You’re not a Blackhat. You\nhelped us hunt down and kill and turn too many of them.” He leaned\nforward. “Who the pit are you working for? There’s no one else.”\nMichel gave Tenik a tight smile. He was acutely aware that every word\nhe spoke here could be used against him. But he was also tired—tired of the\nmasquerades and the lying. Yaret had taken him in. Tenik had been Michel’s\npartner. He woke up in the middle of the night sometimes thinking of ways\nto help Yaret against his enemies in Landfall, only to remember that he now\nwas one of those enemies. “I was working for you.”\nTenik’s tired face twisted. “No, you weren’t.” There was venom in his\nvoice. “You were using us. We still don’t know to what end—something to\ndo with Sedial, or so we’ve gathered. His granddaughter has disappeared,\nbut we haven’t been able to discover anything else. What was it, Michel?\nYaret adopted you. I considered you a friend. What are your true colors?”\nThe real hurt in Tenik’s voice twisted something in Michel’s gut. He had\nto use every bit of self-control not to spill out every secret, not to attempt to\nexplain himself at any cost. “What am I?” he asked.\n“A spy. A traitor.”"

Tenik’s dismissive words\nabout there not being anyone else to work for had touched something inside\nof him. “Who are the people that everyone uses but no one thinks about?\nWho are the rightful heirs to Fatrasta? Who has been kicked and beaten and\nenslaved since the Kressians first set foot on our shores?” He heard his own\nvoice echoing and had to rein in his anger.\nTenik gave a sudden, quiet gasp. “The Palo?”\nMichel clenched his teeth. He’d said too much. Betrayed himself. He\nkicked himself that he hadn’t turned to run yet.\n“By our dead god,” Tenik breathed. “You’re a Palo freedom fighter. That\nexplains so much.” Tenik’s expression softened. He suddenly laughed.\nThe sound made Michel bristle. “What’s so funny?”\n“We’re on the same side!” Tenik said excitedly. “Don’t you see? We’re\nfreeing the Palo. We’re bringing them back into the fold. Treating them\nbetter than they’ve ever been treated. You’re our cousins. Our kin.”\n“The Palo don’t belong to you,” Michel said flatly.\nThat flare of excitement disappeared from Tenik’s face, replaced by\nconfusion. “You don’t think fealty to the emperor is a price worth paying\nfor a better life?”\n“Not under threat of the sword,” Michel said. He held up one hand. “I’ll\ngive you this—you do seem to be treating the Palo better. The whole idea\ngives me an ounce of peace and hope for the future. But there’s something\nrotten in the guts of your empire. Why do you think I continue to fight?\nSedial is at the heart of it. He knows that I know, that’s why he hates me.” It\nwasn’t strictly true. But it was close enough.\nTenik regarded Michel warily. “You are not what we thought.”\n“I’ve worked hard to make that the case.” Michel paused. Despite all of\nthis, it still hurt him to see Tenik in such a condition. “Will they allow you a\nPrivileged healer?”\n“I’m on a waiting list,” Tenik said, looking away. A thousand little ticks\ncrossed his face, too quickly for Michel to read with any depth. When he\nfinally looked back at Michel, he was a mask of fury. “Leave.”\nMichel flinched at the word. It was so angry. So final. He gave Tenik a\ncurious glance.\nTenik went on. “For better or for worse, you were my brother for the\nspace of a summer. I will not call for the guards and drag you before the\nGreat Ka. I’m going to tell Yaret that I saw you, and he’s going to decide\nwhether or not to report that to Ka-Sedial.” Tenik leaned forward. “I’m\ngoing to let you take whatever you have in your hand and leave. You used\nus, but you used us well, and Yaret was able to further the Household due to\nyour actions. For that, I’ll let you go.”"

You are an enemy of the state. If I see you again, I\nwill not hesitate to call for a guard if I cannot kill or capture you myself. I\nsuggest you leave the city. Don’t make me follow through on this threat.”\nTenik’s gaze fell to the floor.\n“I am sorry,” Michel said.\nThere was no response. Michel slowly backed out, waiting for that\nfateful shout. He reached the hall and let himself take a few quick breaths,\nthen hurried out of the archives and up toward the first floor. He kept his\neyes on the ground, walking quickly, hoping not to be recognized by any of\nthe early-morning staff that had just begun to arrive.\nHe was able to reach Greenfire Depths without incident. He wanted\nnothing more than to head back to the safe house and crawl into bed next to\nIchtracia, to try and catch up on some of the sleep that he’d missed. But the\nmeeting with Tenik had rattled him and he doubted that sleep would come.\nHe navigated the early-morning traffic and headed to the one post office in\nGreenfire Depths.\nThe Dynize had kept the postal system open, oddly enough. Letters and\npackages wouldn’t leave Landfall, of course, but they would be moved\naround within the city without being molested. He’d heard that the Dynize\nthemselves had begun to use the post for official, but unimportant,\ncommunication—just another way they had co-opted the previously created\nsystems within Fatrasta.\nMichel flipped through the file once more, sitting on a stoop outside the\npost office. He read it carefully, blacking out the three times his name was\nmentioned and making sure there was nothing else that could lead back to\nhim. Once he’d finished, he wrapped the file in paper and slid it into an\nenvelope.\nHe smiled politely at the woman at the counter and handed the package\nto her. “Hello. I’d like this delivered to the Yaret Household tomorrow\nmorning. Eight o’clock. No earlier. No later.” He slid her a hundred-krana\nnote. “This is very important.”\nCHAPTER 19\nS\ntyke rode alongside Ka-poel while he kept a wary eye on the dragonman\nat the head of the small column. Orz had not spoken to any of them for two\ndays. It was a sharp contrast to his talkative self after the landing, and it left\na worried knot in Styke’s stomach. He tried to ignore it. There wasn’t much\nelse he could do.\n“You didn’t know your sister’s name?” he asked Ka-poel.\nKa-poel started out of her own thoughts. She gestured for him to repeat\nthe question, then leaned across the gap between her and Celine to tap the\ngirl on the knee. Celine dutifully translated what she said next.\nNo. I had a vague memory of a girl and a name I associated with her."

Ka-poel paused for a moment, some unreadable emotion flickering\nacross her face. I’ve actually spoken to her. No. “Spoken” is the wrong\nword. She tapped the side of her head. I’ve communed with her.\n“Is that another thing a bone-eye can do? Like when Ka-Sedial spoke\nthrough that poor bastard at Starlight?”\nIt’s different from that. More direct. I discovered the ability a year or two\nago when Ka-Sedial first tried to reach into my mind. I used it to find Mara,\nand to gain knowledge of the upcoming invasion.\n“You knew about the invasion?” Styke asked. “Did you bother telling\nanyone?”\nWho would have believed me? Lindet? No. Taniel and I began making\nour own preparations. But this communication. It is not perfect. It requires\na blood link and a strong willingness, and even with those things it is less\nlike speaking and more like—she made several gestures that Celine just\nshook her head at, then continued—It’s more like two mute children\ndrawing pictures to each other. She smiled briefly at something. Taniel and\nI sent a man to find Mara. From what Taniel has told me through our own\nlink, our man found her and brought her out of Landfall. I can only imagine\nwhat frustration he felt when he found out her name wasn’t actually Mara.\nBut he succeeded. I hope my sister is safe. I hope I live through the coming\nmonths so that I may meet her.\nIt was the first time Ka-poel had acknowledged that their mission had a\nchance of failing, and it caught Styke off guard. “You’re awfully\nintrospective today.”\nKa-poel frowned at him. I am learning who I am. Where I came from. I\nsaw into the heart of my grandfather and saw his lust for power. It was an\nugly thing, but worse—because I saw the same in my own heart when I took\ncontrol of that group of dragoons in the Hock. Do you know what it is like\nto learn who you are? What you are?\n“Yes,” Styke said, sucking in a deep breath. He thought of the men he’d\nkilled in his search for vengeance, and the men he’d spared. “Yeah, I think I\nmight know what that’s like.”\nThen, you know how awful it can be.\nKa-poel’s hands ceased flashing and she fell into a brooding stillness.\nStyke watched her for a few moments, then lifted his head to look along the\ncolumn. The men had taken to their roles well and without complaint,\nthough they still cast suspicious glances at Orz whenever the dragonman\nwasn’t looking. They remained silent when there was company on the road,\ndidn’t sing or laugh into the night, and listened to the dragonman’s lectures.\nThey were all old Lancers, though, and he would have expected nothing\nless.

        "text": "the stakes were higher now.\nThey emerged from the swamp about midday, leaving the main highway\nand cutting west into some hilly terrain that took them up and around the\nback of a small mountain. The road was lined with houses here, creating an\nalmost suburban feel. After a couple hours of climbing, Styke finally urged\nhis horse up next to Orz, giving the dragonman a sidelong glance before\nspeaking.\n“Have we turned to go around the city?”\nOrz shook his head. “Going around would take too long.”\n“Then, where are we headed?”\n“A western district. But I’ve taken a short detour.”\nStyke felt himself tense. “Why?”\n“To show you something.”\n“Which is?”\n“Soon,” Orz responded cryptically, pointing up the trail. Styke fell back\nto the rear of the column again and kept his hand on the butt of his carbine,\nwatching the road carefully. If Orz was going to spring a trap, he would\nhave done it already. Wouldn’t he? He tried to shake off the distrust, but\nsignaled silently to Jackal to keep eyes open. The signal was passed up the\ncolumn behind Orz’s back.\nThey soon rounded a bend and climbed a crest in the road. Styke was so\nbusy watching their flanks that he only heard the first gasps. His head\njerked forward and he urged Amrec on quickly, only to come over the crest\nhimself and pull hard on the reins.\nAn immense valley spread out before them, cradled in low mountains on\nthe western side and spilling out into the Jagged Fens on the east. It was at\nleast five miles wide and ten miles long, at a guess, and it was filled by a\nlake that stretched for most of the length and breadth of it, though the\ngeography was clearly not what had elicited gasps from the Mad Lancers.\nA city had been built upon the very waters of the lake—an immense\nmetropolis constructed along causeways of raised dirt and stone,\ncrisscrossed by canals as thin as alleys and as wide as thoroughfares. Both\nroads and canals were lined with stone villas, cornered by marketplaces,\npierced by the sharp angles of archaic city walls and huge temples that rose\nhalf a dozen stories above all the other buildings.\n“Talunlica,” Orz announced, gesturing expansively with one hand at the\nentirety of the valley.\nStyke rode several paces out ahead of the other Lancers, until Amrec’s\nhooves were at the edge of a cliff, and leaned forward to stare at the city. It\nwas infinitely complex at a glance, divided into sectors that themselves\nwere divided. He’d seen planned cities before—some of the more\npurposefully founded towns on the Fatrastan frontier—but none of them\ngave even the slightest inkling of what lay before him now. Even to his\nuntrained eye, the entirety of the place had been laid out with purpose,\nevery stone planned, every road with a destination.\nIt was a city that had been created not just to live in but to be seen.\n“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Orz spoke with a smugness that seemed\nunfitting to his character.\n“It is.” Styke was genuinely impressed, and he immediately saw why"

        "text": "“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Orz spoke with a smugness that seemed\nunfitting to his character.\n“It is.” Styke was genuinely impressed, and he immediately saw why\nOrz had chosen to make this detour. If they had ridden directly into the city,\nit would have been a hard thing to explain, a hard thing to grasp. Even now,\nstaring at it from above, he felt like there were patterns to the design that his\neye couldn’t see, like the finest of Gurlish rugs in a rich man’s house.\nHis eyes traveled to the center of the city, to the one large island from\nwhich the rest of the man-made avenues and canals seemed to radiate. The\nisland was walled off with immense stone facades, each sharp angle\npunctuated by squat turrets that looked big enough to hold entire gun\nbatteries. He felt his vision pulled beyond those walls, to a great black\nmonolith that sprouted from the center of the island. At this distance it\nlooked small, but based entirely on perspective the thing had to be at least\nas tall as the Landfall Plateau.\n“Is that it?” he asked. His voice came out as a harsh whisper.\n“That’s it,” Orz answered.\nFor the first time Styke became conscious of Ka-poel at his side, sitting\nforward in the saddle in the same pose as himself. Her eyes jumped around\nthe city as if to take in every detail. If she had noticed the monolith in the\ncenter, the goal of their expedition staring them in the face, she gave no\nindication of it.\n“Come,” Orz finally said. “We’ll head to one of the western districts. I\nknow of an inn that caters to slav—to foreigners. It’ll be the best place to\nbunk down for a night or two while we take care of business in the city.”\n“Shouldn’t we go around the city? Maybe just you and I can go in to\nretrieve your parents?”\n“We could,” Orz agreed, “but it would take far too long. If we want to\nreach the rest of your army with any amount of speed, we’ll have to cut\nthrough Talunlica.”\nStyke nodded absently, his eyes still glued to the godstone. Even at this\ndistance he thought he could smell the coppery tinge of blood sorcery on\nthe wind, but dismissed it as his imagination.\nOrz rode off, followed slowly by the rest of the Mad Lancers, until\nStyke was left alone.\nNo, not alone.\nKa-poel nudged her horse closer to his and reached out, giving his hand\na quick squeeze. She signed briefly—a simple set of gestures that needed no\ntranslation.\nThank you for bringing me home.\nThey descended from their mountaintop vantage and skirted the base of the\nlake for several miles before turning into one of the long, straight avenues\nthat connected the city of Talunlica with the shoreline. The crowds grew\nthick, the stares less interested, as the Mad Lancers entered a place where\nforeigners were a more common sight than in the rest of Dynize.\nDespite the grids, canals, and walls, Styke was surprised to note that the\ncity itself did not seem to be built with self-defense in mind.

There were as many barges and\ncanoes traveling the waterways as there were carts and carriages traversing\nthe avenues. Aqueducts lined each street, bringing fresh water from the\nmountains and, according to Orz, taking black water down to where the\nlake fed a river into the Jagged Fens. There was lush greenery everywhere,\nfrom small squares filled with towering cypress tress to floating islands of\nloamy soil that acted as community gardens.\nThe inn Orz had promised was a sprawling compound in one of the\nwestern districts. Orz explained that it was one of the older buildings in the\ncity, built on one of the many islands and originally a headquarters for a\nHousehold that had grown rich off trading foreign slaves during the war.\nNow it was used as a stopping point for slaves traveling to and from the\ncity. An old brass placard outside the gate was easy enough to translate: THE\nKRESSIAN INN AND BOARDING.\nThe owner was a middle-aged man with a bored expression whose eyes\nwidened briefly at the sight of Orz before taking on a businesslike calm. He\nsat behind a low stone desk in the corner of the compound courtyard,\nwearing a thin cotton shirt and a single feather hanging from the one braid\nin his long hair. A handful of stable boys played dice nearby.\nOrz swung down from his horse, gesturing Styke to follow, and the two\napproached the owner. Orz produced a coin—stamped copper by the look\nof it—and set it on the innkeep’s desk. It was the first time Styke had seen\nsuch a coin, but the innkeep simply nodded as if it were proper currency.\n“These are my wards,” Orz told him. “Give them somewhere they can\ndrink and not be bothered.” Or bother anyone else seemed to be the\nimplication.\n“Of course, Servant.”\n“This man here is named Ben,” Orz jerked a thumb at Styke. “He speaks\nwith my authority. Understood?”\nThe innkeep gave another brisk nod and barked a series of quick orders\nto the stable boys. Within minutes the horses had been taken, clean water\nprovided to the soldiers, and they were all led to a building in a far corner of\nthe compound. It was two stories with a flat, shaded roof, a large great-\nroom, and several dozen cells that each provided a small sleeping\ncompartment. A couple of slaves—Gurlish women in their late fifties—\nwere whisked away to another part of the inn.\n“Can we relax here?” Styke asked Orz quietly as the innkeep flitted\naround the room, making sure that everything was made right and all the\nsoldiers comfortable.\n“For now,” Orz answered. “We shouldn’t stay more than a day or two, or\nwe will attract attention. But that’s all the time we need.”\nStyke gestured Jackal over. “They’ve been good. Let them kick their feet\nup tonight. Gamble, drink. But keep away from the locals.” He caught the\neye of the innkeep and said one of the first words Orz had taught them in\nDynize: “Beer!”\nA small smile played out across Orz’s face. “Dynize spirits aren’t great,”"

He could already taste it.\n“You’ll have to wait.”\n“Oh?”\n“Yes. Bring Ka-poel and Celine. We’re going out.”\nCHAPTER 20\nV\nlora’s quick march off the Cape of New Adopest was arrested by the\narrival of a messenger from General Sabastenien. The messenger was a\nyoung man coated in sweat and dust, looking tired and vaguely shell-\nshocked. His salute was halfhearted and his horse was limping.\n“Message from our cavalry, ma’am,” he said before he’d even come to a\nstop near Vlora and a small group of officers with whom she’d been\nconferring.\nVlora blinked at the messenger through a haze and wondered if she\nlooked as tired and strung out as he did. She hadn’t slept in almost thirty-\nfour hours. Olem’s abandonment was still forefront in her mind, despite all\nshe’d done to bury it beneath loads of work. It took all of her energy just to\nkeep her face neutral, her eyes dry, and her mind focused on the duties of\ncommanding a field army. She wondered how she managed to stay upright\nin her saddle. “Report,” she barked.\n“Yes, ma’am. We managed to catch up with the Dynize earlier today.\nGot in a few good hours of dogging their rearguard and harassing their\ntrain. Unfortunately they reached their reinforcements just a couple hours\nago and we were forced to pull back when they about-faced on us.”\n“Reinforcements?” Vlora echoed.\n“Yes, ma’am. Another Dynize field army has joined them. They’ve\narrayed themselves to give battle at a bit of hilly ground just as we’re\ncoming off the Cape and onto the mainland. General Sabastenien says\nthey’re trying to use the terrain to neutralize our superior cavalry.”\n“It sounds that way.” This was one of the things Vlora had feared about\nheading onto the Cape in the first place—that the Dynize would try to bottle\nthem up here. Now it had come true, and they were outnumbered two to\none. She would have cursed herself for a fool if she didn’t know that the\nalternative would have been leaving Etepali to run rampant behind her.\n“Anything else?”\n“General Sabastenien has found a defensible position for us to camp\ntonight and is waiting there—it’s about two miles from the head of the\ncolumn. That’s all.”\n“Good. Get some rest, Private. I’ll send one of my own messengers with\na reply.”\n“Thank you, ma’am.”\nVlora turned her attention back to her officers. They whispered among\nthemselves, brows wrinkled, already talking strategy of fighting two field\narmies at once. She wondered if they blamed her for letting Etepali slip\naway. She certainly blamed herself.\n“My friends,” she said, “you heard the report.”\n“Yes, ma’am,” came the echoed reply.\n“Any suggestions?”\nA colonel whose name had slipped her mind said from the back, “We"

Call in the fleet to ferry us down the coast.”\n“Maybe,” Vlora said, “but that’s risky. It’ll force us to break up our\nstrength.”\n“We can swing around to the north and try to hit them one army at a\ntime,” someone else suggested.\n“We’d have to be damned fast,” Vlora replied, shaking her head. She’d\nalready decided to acknowledge Etepali as a clever commander, and that\nmeant assuming she was smart enough to counter any of the simpler\nstrategies that Vlora might attempt. The way she saw it, she had two\nchoices: to punch them hard and fast, giving them little time to prepare; or\nto pull up into a defensible position and draw the enemy to her. The former\nwas risky and would throw them right into the maw of an enemy that\noutnumbered them. The latter could waste precious weeks and depended on\nthe general of this new field army to be aggressive and daft.\nVlora fell into her own thoughts, half listening while her senior officers\ndiscussed possible strategies. The only bright side to all of this was that\nnone of them seemed particularly bothered by the idea of fighting a superior\nDynize force. Several minutes passed while she listened and slowly grew\nalarmed by their cavalier attitude. She finally roused herself.\n“Gentlemen and women,” she said loudly, quieting the group. “I’d like\nto remind you that while we have the edge on the Dynize technologically,\nthey have more Privileged and they have bone-eyes. If any of you doubt the\neffectiveness of the bone-eyes, I invite you to speak with the officers from\nmy mercenary company. They’ll tell you how the Dynize refused to break\nat Landfall.”\nThe group fell into a rocky silence.\n“We’ll still beat them,” Vlora added, injecting as much confidence as\nshe could bring to bear. “I would just prefer to do it with fewer casualties.\nSo I remind you to not plan anything stupid in the assumption that we’re\ngoing to walk all over a bunch of backward savages. The Dynize are neither\nof those things.”\n“Yes, ma’am,” came the chorus of answers.\nShe nodded for them to continue their planning, and turned forward in\nthe saddle, ready to sink back into her own malaise. Every strategy she\nreached for, every plan she began to grasp, seemed to fall apart before she\ncould fully get her head around it. Her mind kept turning to how much\neasier this would be with Olem at her side—a thought that made her feel\nangry and guilty all at once. She brought her head up and scanned the\nhorizon for a distraction—any distraction—from her own brain.\nHer eyes fell on a row occurring about a hundred yards away on the\nother side of the marching column. It was too far for her to make out the\ndetails of what was going on, but it seemed that at least a dozen of her\ncavalry were attempting to corner someone on horseback. One of her\ncavalry finally broke away, riding across the column and coming to join her.\n“What’s going on, soldier?” she asked, nodding in the direction of the"

Wouldn’t normally bring this to you, but there’s some\nkind of incident with a local.”\n“What kind of incident?”\n“It’s a Palo, ma’am. Claims he knows you. Claims he has important\nintelligence for you.”\nVlora scowled. “And why didn’t you send him to me?”\n“Well, he’s a Palo, ma’am.”\n“And what difference does that make?”\nThe cavalryman opened his mouth, closed it again, and looked deeply\nuncomfortable. “I thought we didn’t have any allies among the natives,\nma’am.”\nVlora grit her teeth and reminded herself that these soldiers were freshly\narrived from the Nine, where Palo were still considered a backward\ncuriosity. “Bring him here,” she ordered. “Wait, did this Palo give you a\nname?”\n“Calls himself Burt, I think.”\n“Brown Bear Burt?” Vlora asked, feeling her mind shed some of her\nexhaustion. “Never mind, take me to him. Now!”\nShe followed the cavalryman across the column to find Brown Bear Burt\nin the center of a knot of cavalry. He had a pistol in one hand, his boz knife\nin the other, and was gripping the reins with his teeth while he brandished\nboth at the cavalry. He was sweaty, dusty, and worn, with a bloodstain on\nthe left sleeve of his riding jacket. His horse looked worse than he did,\nfavoring one leg and swaying badly.\n“Lady Flint!” Vlora’s accompanying cavalryman announced loudly.\nVlora rode into the group. “What the damned pit is the meaning of\nthis?” she demanded. “This man is my friend and a guest, and you will treat\nhim as such! You, summon a medic. You, get him a fresh horse. Jump, god\ndamn it!” The knot of cavalry scattered to the wind, leaving Vlora alone\nwith Burt.\nBurt spat his reins out of his mouth and let out a litany of curses in\nseveral different languages as he holstered his pistol and knife. “Your boys\nare seriously protective of you,” he finally said.\n“I’m sorry, they—”\nBurt waved away the apology. “Disheveled-looking foreigner armed to\nthe teeth and demanding to see your commanding officer? Probably for the\nbest.” He squinted and blinked at her. “You look like you got run over by a\nherd of cattle. What the pit happened to you?”\n“Long story. Why are you here, Burt? I thought you were taking the\ntrunk of the godstone up to the Palo Nation.”\nBurt took a deep breath and stripped off his jacket, taking a good look at\nhis arm. “Grazed,” he muttered. “Hurts like the pit.” The wound was recent.\n“That’s not from my men, is it?” Vlora asked.\n“No, no. Damned Dynize. They get itchy when you refuse to stop for\ntheir questions. I was escorting the godstone up north.

But a whole lot\nhappened after you left Yellow Creek.”\nVlora felt like a stiff wind might knock her off her horse at this point,\nand she could see the storm clouds in Burt’s eyes that heralded a whole lot\nof bad news. She gripped her saddle horn. “There wasn’t much left of\nYellow Creek last I saw it.”\n“And there’s nothing left now.” Burt spat into the dirt. “A few days after\nyou left, a whole Dynize brigade rolled in. I’d left a few of my boys behind\nto keep an eye on things and they came and got me when the Dynize\narrived.”\n“Looking for the godstone?”\n“That’s what we thought at first. They put the whole town to the sword.\nButchered everyone. Men, women, children. Anyone they couldn’t catch\nthey chased into the mountains. Then they brought in a handful of\nPrivileged and began work on that scree slope below where Little Flerring\nbusted up the godstone.”\nVlora stared at Burt, horrified. “Why?”\n“They pulled something else out of the mountainside.” Burt sniffed.\n“Something hidden way down below the godstone.”\n“Hidden?” Vlora echoed.\n“Buried,” Burt corrected. “Probably not on purpose.”\n“What was it?”\n“Big old block of stone. Flat, like a mighty table. It looks just like the\ngodstone, and I suspect that it’s a pedestal of some kind.”\nVlora ran her hands through her hair. The capstone was now with her\nfleet, and everyone who knew anything about it—Prime Lektor and Julene,\nspecifically—were there protecting the damned thing. The root of the\ngodstone had gone with Burt. So what was this new piece that the Dynize\nhad found? If it was truly a pedestal, it might be integral to the godstone as\na whole. She looked around for a messenger. “I need to talk to Prime,” she\nmuttered.\n“That Privileged from Yellow Creek?”\n“Yeah.”\n“I have a damned mind to hold his feet to the fire to find out if there’s\nsomething we—all of us—missed.” Burt seemed to push away his\nexhaustion, his face hardening. “Whatever it was, the Dynize killed a lot of\nmy friends to hide it.”\nVlora searched her saddlebags and produced a canteen of rum, handing\nit to Burt. He took a swig, sputtered, and spat. “Kresimir on a cracker, I\nthought that was water.” Once he’d recovered, he took a more measured sip\nand handed the canteen back, wiping his face with his jacket. “Thanks, I\nneeded that.”\n“So what happened to the stone they pulled out of the mountain-side?”\nVlora asked.\n“They headed south,” Burt replied. “I was halfway across the Ironhooks\nwhen I got the message. Sent the rest of the godstone on to my people and\ngrabbed what men I could and headed back. They were gone by the time we\nreached Yellow Creek—they dragged their prize to the Hadshaw and loaded\nit onto a keelboat. Made it about a hundred and fifty miles before we caught\nup to them.”"

Made it about a hundred and fifty miles before we caught\nup to them.”\n“You chased a Dynize brigade with a handful of irregulars?”\nBurt eyeballed her. “You think I’m gonna let them get away with killing\nmy friends? Of course we did. Managed to butcher a handful of them at a\njoint in the river, killed three of their Privileged, but lost a lot of my own\nboys.”\n“Three Privileged,” Vlora said flatly.\n“Yeah, three of the bastards. I subscribe to the Ben Styke theory of\nkilling sorcerers: Hit them hard and hit them fast. Kill them before they can\nput their gloves on. Palo Nation irregulars are the best guerrilla fighters in\nthe world, Flint.” He made a few motions as if drawing a map in the air.\n“We managed to get ahead of them and sink the keelboat hauling that\npedestal, but like I said, we took a bad hit. What irregulars I have left are\nback there right now, harassing the shit out of the Dynize to keep them from\nrecovering their prize. I’ve sent for backup, but when I found out you had\nan entire army over here, I thought you might be closer.”\n“Shit,” Vlora said quietly, her mind racing. She pictured a map of the\nregion in her head. “If you sank their keelboat about a hundred and fifty\nmiles south of Yellow Creek, that means they’re… almost dead west of us\nright now.”\n“That’s right.”\n“I’ve got two Dynize field armies between me and them.”\nBurt grimaced, touching his arm. “I did notice that.”\nOne of Vlora’s soldiers returned with a medic. Vlora and Burt both\ndismounted, letting the medic clean and stitch Burt’s wound while another\nsoldier brought him a new horse and went about switching saddles and bags\nbetween the two animals. “Don’t let that limp fool ya,” Burt told the soldier,\n“she’s still good to go. I want her back, so don’t go shooting her for the\nafternoon stew. Ow.” The medic pulled on the stitches and tied off a knot.\nVlora dismissed her, leaving the two of them alone again.\n“I’m not sure what I can do,” Vlora said hesitantly.\n“I’m not, either,” Burt replied. “If I didn’t need the help, I wouldn’t ask\nfor it. Whatever it is the Dynize got their hands on, they wanted it pretty\nbad, and that means I want to take it away.”\n“I don’t disagree.” Vlora felt the beginning of a plan forming in the back\nof her head. “When did you sink that keelboat?”\n“About eight days ago.”\n“And how much longer do you think you can keep them occupied?”\n“Maybe another week or two, if we’re lucky. They’re damned persistent\nand they’ve got readier access to their friends. I won’t be surprised if they\nalready have a couple more brigades heading up river to help them.”\n“No,” Vlora said thoughtfully. “Me neither.” Her mind was working\novertime now, spinning through a hundred different possibilities.

I want us camped on their front door, so close we can\nthrow rocks at each other.

As if to answer him, Orz stopped just outside the gate\nand threw a light scarf over his shoulders, flipping it up to shade his face\nfrom the sun—and hide his tattoos. He gazed thoughtfully back at Styke for\na few moments, his mind clearly elsewhere, before answering.\n“Not worried, no,” Orz said, tapping the shawl. “This is a precaution. I\nsuspect everyone who might recognize me is fighting in Fatrasta.”\n“And if not?” Styke asked.\n“If not, I still have this.” Orz produced a card from his pocket and\nhanded it to Styke. It had a broken seal of black wax stamped with three\nstars, and inside was a very official-looking letter. Both the envelope and\nthe paper inside were made of heavy, waxed paper, which explained how it\nsurvived Orz’s stowaway. “This is my letter of pardon from Ka-Sedial,” Orz\nexplained. “If something happens to me, I want you to recover it from my\ncorpse. It’s not as good as having me with you in person, but it might get\nyou past checkpoints and awkward questions.”\nStyke glanced over the card thoughtfully and handed it back. This felt\nlike some kind of a trap—an opportunity for him to turn on Orz, steal the\nletter, and use it to get him to his destination. “You trust me to know about\nthis?”\nOrz shrugged. “I have no reason not to. I’ve been watching you for\nweeks, remember? Trailing you for much longer. You’re a killer, but you’re\nnot an assassin.”\nStyke snorted. “I suppose that’s a compliment.”\n“It is,” Orz replied. His gaze swiveled to Ka-poel and Celine. “You,\nbone-eye, walk with me in front. Girl, stay with Styke and walk a few paces\nbehind us.” He headed down the street without further explanation. Ka-poel\nscurried to keep up with him.

They walked side-by-side like old friends, and he could hear Orz\nspeaking to her in a low voice. Ka-poel’s hands moved in response, but as\nthey were in front of her, Styke couldn’t see her replies. It seemed curious\nto him that Orz had requested Celine to come along but didn’t bother to\nhave her translate.

In which case, how the pit did she not know that he\nwas a stowaway on the Seaward? Or did she know? And if so, why hadn’t\nshe said anything?\nThe thought swam around inside his head, and he argued with himself\nover possibilities and motivations. He grew increasingly frustrated with the\ntrain of thought, doubly so because he knew that if he asked her outright, he\ncouldn’t expect a straight answer.\n“Ben, why are you squeezing me so hard?”\nStyke looked down at Celine, who was actively attempting to extricate\nher hand from his. He let go and she almost fell, shooting him a glare.\n“Sorry,” he told her. “I was thinking about something.”\n“You’re thinking too hard,” Celine said pointedly. “You’re scaring\npeople.”\nStyke glanced around and noted that an approaching Dynize woman\ntook a sharp turn at an intersection the moment their eyes met. She hurried\naway, leaving Styke to attempt to peel the scowl off his own face.\n“You wouldn’t be a very good actor,” Celine told him.\n“Eh?”\nShe pursed her lips and began to skip along at his side, seemingly no\nworse the wear from his squeezing her hand. “You can’t hide your thoughts.\n‘An open face,’ my da used to say. Read you like a book.”\n“I would have turned your dad inside out if we met on the street,” Styke\nshot back, somewhat more aggressively than he’d meant to.\nCeline giggled. “Nah, he would have avoided you bad. He would have\nread you and taken a different street.”\n“Smarter than I’ve given him credit for.”\n“Maybe,” Celine said with a tiny shrug, “or maybe not. Thing is, we’re\nfar from home and you need to act more like you belong if we’re gonna get\nback.” The words were heavy and thoughtful, but her tone was as light as\nany child’s, as if she didn’t really understand the weight of them.\n“Where the pit are you getting that kind of talk?” Styke asked. “You’re\ntoo young for it.”\n“Sunin. Ka-poel. The Lancers.” Celine continued to skip. “They know\nyou’re doing your best, but they’re a little bit worried.”\n“Worried about what?”"

The Lancers.” Celine continued to skip. “They know\nyou’re doing your best, but they’re a little bit worried.”\n“Worried about what?”\nCeline stopped suddenly, for just a couple of beats, then ran to catch up.\nShe wore an expression as if she’d just figured out that relaying this kind of\ngossip to their officer made her a snitch. “Nothing,” she said evasively.\n“Spill it,” Styke told her.\nShe pulled another, more comical face, then continued. “It’s like I just\nsaid.”\n“And you’re going to elaborate.”\n“That you can get us out of this,” she said in a quick rush. “It’s not the\nfighting that worries them—they know you’re the biggest and meanest and\nthat you’ll always carve a path through the enemy to get them home. But\nwe’re not in a spot that you can fight us out of. You’ve got to be meek, and\nthey don’t think you can do it.”\nStyke chewed on the inside of his cheek. His first response was anger,\ntinged with indignation. His soldiers had lost faith in him? But he quickly\nmoved past that and forced himself to listen—to really listen—to those\nwords. Celine sounded as if she were parroting them straight from one of\nthe older Lancers. Probably Sunin. That old shithead. “What do you mean,\n‘meek’?”\n“Like this,” Celine said, gesturing around them. “We’re walking behind\nOrz, but you still look like you’re in charge. But you’re supposed to be\npretending to be a slave.” Styke gestured for her to talk more quietly, and\nshe went on in a softer voice. “You’re supposed to be a slave, but you don’t\nact like it.”\n“And how am I supposed to do that? It’s not like I can help my size.”\n“No, but you can help your posture. Your expression.”\n“I don’t follow.”\n“Hunch your shoulders,” Celine suggested. “Don’t scowl at everyone.\nDon’t make eye contact. You remember what it was like to be at the labor\ncamp?”\nStyke let out a little involuntary growl. “Yes.”\n“Act like that.”\n“I’m not going to be a slave again.”\n“But you can pretend to be one to save all our lives.”\n“I can’t believe I’m having this conversation with a little squirt like\nyou.”\nCeline fixed him with a serious look. “I remember the camps,” she said\nsolemnly. “And I remember when my da went on benders and I had to fend\nfor myself in the streets. I remember what it’s like to have to stay\nunnoticed.”\nThere was something in that youthful solemnity that finally broke\nthrough to Styke. He looked away, lifting his eyes to the skyline of\nTalunlica—an unfamiliar skyline, in an unfamiliar city, in an unfamiliar\ncountry.\nHe knew the Lancers talked among themselves. That’s what soldiers did.\nBut for the last week they’d followed orders to the letter, without showing\nan ounce of hesitation, and not once had they let their own doubt spill over\nto where he could see it.

He rubbed the back of his head. He missed Ibana. He needed\nsomeone on hand who would tell him when he was being an idiot, tell him\nwhen his orders went beyond foolhardy to suicidal. Because maybe that’s\nall this jaunt was.\n“You’re a good kid,” he finally said.\nCeline grinned up at him. “I thought you said I was a pre… preco—”\n“Precocious little shit. Yeah, you’re that, too.” Styke took her hand\nagain. “Okay, how’s this?” He forced the scowl from his face and turned his\neyes downward. As they walked, he tried to hunch his shoulders, making\nhimself remember—truly remember—those afternoons at the labor camp.\nAvoiding the beatings of the guards. Dodging fights with the other inmates.\nJust trying to get by. He remembered shrinking into himself, ticking off the\nhours until the next parole hearing.\nHe couldn’t even remember what had broken inside himself to become\nsuch a mouse. Whatever it was, it had healed. He would die before he let\nhimself become that again. But… Celine was right. He needed to at least act\nlike a mouse again to get his people through this damned city.\n“That’s better,” Celine said, examining him with a critical eye. “Don’t\nmake eye contact with people.”\n“You really pay attention to this sort of thing?”\n“Didn’t you?”\nHe grimaced. “Right. I’ll practice this. And when I’m finished being a\n‘slave,’ I’m going to burn this city to the ground.”\nCeline giggled as if he’d said something funny, and the two of them fell\ninto a silence. Styke did his best to keep his head down but his eyes open,\nand he gradually felt like it was working. People stared less when he was\nhunched over. Some didn’t even seem to notice him. His own perception\nfelt as if it had widened and he began to grasp things he hadn’t before—to\nsee the occasional foreign slave, to notice the different castes among the\nDynize, including their varied clothing, the way they walked, and even their\npostures.\nBeside it all, he kept adding to the map of the city in his head. Talunlica\nwas wide and open, with few enormous buildings to block out the horizon\nand many definite landmarks because of the surrounding mountains. But the\nnature of its construction presented a whole different set of challenges. The\navenues jumped from island to island, with smaller bridges and causeways\ncreating shortcuts between them. He had to keep track not just of the\nphysical roads but also of the waterways and their widths and depths, which\nhe noticed were marked to aid the boat traffic—of which there was a\nconsiderable amount.\nHe was so focused on taking all of this in that he didn’t really notice\nwhere they were going until they arrived. Celine tugging on his hand\nprevented him from running into Orz. Styke looked up in surprise, rubbed\nat his nose, and suddenly realized that his nostrils were full of a dusty,\nangry scent.\nThey were in a wide city square at the convergence of several avenues."

People\npicnicked, lounged, and even prayed, and it took Styke a moment to realize\nwhy.\nThe godstone rose above them. They were not at its base—that was\nbehind a large stone wall that separated the imperial compound with the rest\nof Talunlica—but this park had been very clearly set aside as a place for\nsome sort of worship of the stone. A short fence cordoned it off from the\nroad, tall trees provided shade, and decorative facsimiles of the godstone\nabout Styke’s height dotted the perimeter.\nStyke couldn’t take his eyes off the godstone. It wasn’t even the smell of\nsorcery that transfixed him, nor the strange knotting in his gut at the sight of\nit. No, it was simply the size—a single cut piece of stone that rose at least\ntwo hundred feet into the air. The effort to put it there must have been\nincredible. He’d seen the one in Landfall, of course, lying on its side. But\nthis was both bigger and the center of a city that had been designed around\nit. There was a grandeur here that fused ancient and modern and made an\nimpression even on him.\nHe allowed Orz to lead their small group to an isolated spot at the\nwater’s edge in one corner of the park. He leaned against a stone wall and\ncraned his head to gaze at the stone, slack-jawed.\n“It’s something, isn’t it?” Orz asked.\n“I had my doubts,” Styke replied.\n“Worth fighting a war over?”\n“Let’s not get carried away.”\nOrz laughed. “What about you, Sister Pole?”\nKa-poel’s examination of the stone seemed far more clinical than\nStyke’s. She looked it up and down, one finger tapping against her jaw. She\ngestured, and Celine translated dutifully: I need to get closer.\n“This is the closest we can get,” Orz said. “This park is technically\nwithin the imperial compound, but the walls were moved when they\nrealized that people were blocking traffic to worship the stone.”\n“I heard a rumor,” Styke said, “that the stone in Landfall was driving\npeople mad.”\n“Not a rumor,” Orz replied. “The power of this stone is dampened by the\nbone-eyes, but it still drives someone mad every week or so.”\n“That doesn’t make me want to stand near it.”\nOrz seemed amused by the note of reluctance in Styke’s voice. “Doesn’t\nit? There is a whole town dedicated to those who’ve been driven mad by the\nstone. It’s got a very nice view from that mountain over there.” He pointed\nto their northwest. “They’re considered holy men. Many of the worshipers\nhere come every day in the hope that they’re claimed next.”\nStyke snorted. He’d never taken much to religion himself. “Aside from\nthe idea of messing with things clearly beyond the scope of normal\nhumans,” he said, “I’m shocked that a people advanced enough to create"

He’d never taken much to religion himself. “Aside from\nthe idea of messing with things clearly beyond the scope of normal\nhumans,” he said, “I’m shocked that a people advanced enough to create\nthis city are stupid enough to worship a stone that drives them mad.” He\nwatched Orz through the corner of his eye, curious if his words would\noffend.\nThe dragonman just shrugged. “Everyone needs to believe in something\nto feel truly whole. Sometimes that’s an emperor or a god or a politician.\nSometimes it’s themselves. Other times it’s the promise of an ancient stone\ndriving them mad. It mitigates the pain of real life, I believe.”\n“Is this what you wanted to show us?” Styke asked. Ka-poel was still\nengrossed in the stone, her fingers twitching in no understandable language\nand her lips pursed. She looked like she was itching for that closer look.\n“Among other things,” Orz said.\n“And what are those other things?”\n“Just this.” Orz gestured expansively. “I wanted to show you the city, to\nlet you feel its heartbeat. You still intend on attacking it, unless I’m\nmistaken.”\nStyke looked around, but they were well out of earshot of anyone else.\n“That’s the idea.”\n“I wanted to show you that it is just a city. These are normal people\nliving normal lives.”\n“Most cities are full of them,” Styke replied, unsure as to what Orz was\ngetting at.\n“Yes, and that’s my point.” Orz sighed. “These aren’t evil people.\nThey’ve been goaded into a foreign war by an evil man, yes. But most of\nthem will never see Fatrasta. They don’t know or even care about the\nmachinations of Ka-Sedial. They’re just living their lives and they look to\nthe godstone as a representative of something better.”\n“A new god?” Styke asked skeptically.\n“A uniting god. Past glories of an entire hemisphere under one banner,\nliving in peace.”\nStyke harrumphed.\n“Is it a sin to hope for better?”\n“At the cost of my own people? Yes.”\n“Your own people are usurpers. They came across the ocean mere\ngenerations ago. They slaughtered, subjugated, and enslaved the Palo and\ntook the land for their own.”\n“I mean Fatrastans,” Styke replied, feeling a little heated. He pulled his\nanger down.\n“Fatrastans? The concept of a Fatrastan people is less than a generation\nold.”\n“Does it matter whether a people is a decade old or twenty centuries?”\n“I’d imagine it does,” Orz replied.\n“I feel like you’re arguing that the Dynize are right in attacking my\npeople,” Styke said. “But right had nothing to do with it. They’re still my\npeople, and they’re still being attacked.”\n“That’s not what he’s arguing.” Celine sniffed, climbing up on the stone\nfence beside Styke.\n“Eh?” Both he and Orz looked at her.\n“He’s just trying to say that people are the same everywhere.

They’re\njust trying to live their lives.” Celine produced a pebble from one pocket\nand tossed it over her shoulder into the water behind them, smiling at the\ndistinctive plop that it made when it landed. “He’s trying to ask you not to\nslaughter everyone when you attack the city.”\nOrz blinked at Celine for a few moments, then a grin spread across his\nface. “This child never ceases to astound me. Yes, Ben Styke. That’s what\nI’m asking.”\nStyke chewed on the inside of his cheek. It was both a simple request\nand a difficult one. Attacking a city was never pretty and often included a\ngreat deal of bloodshed on both sides. The attackers, no matter how\nmodern-minded and disciplined, always had their blood up by the time they\ngot inside—and that often led to sacking and looting. His gut instinct was to\ntell Orz that the Mad Lancers were above all that, but he remembered what\nValyaine had told him back in Bellport. The Mad Lancers had done\neverything and anything they’d wanted during the Revolution, always with\na word of justification. They’d do the same here.\nCeline suddenly slipped from her seat and headed across the park. Styke\nwas about to call after her when he saw her destination—a gathering of\nchildren not far from them, all seated in a semicircle around a large wooden\nbox with black curtains. Exchanging a glance with Orz, he followed her\nover.\nIt was a puppet show, and he found himself smiling as he joined Celine\nat the back of the semicircle. The puppets were in the middle of some sort\nof conflict. On one side were morion-helmed puppets with freckled faces.\nOn the other were comically oversized giants in sunflower yellow. This was\nthe Fatrastan War, he realized immediately. For a brief moment he thought\nthat the giants were supposed to be him, but then he realized that they were\njust ordinary Fatrastan soldiers, made larger to show their menace.\nIt did not take long to follow the gist of the show. On one side, the\nDynize. Conquering heroes, overwhelming the larger, angrier Fatrastans.\nMore freckled puppets joined from the Fatrastan side, these ones bent and\ndowntrodden until the Fatrastan soldiers had been slain. Palo. Freed from\nservitude.\nOne of the Fatrastan giants fell with a sword through the belly and was\ntossed out onto the ground by the puppeteer. Styke found his eyes drawn to\nthat one puppet, lying broken on the stone, and he found himself\nconsidering Orz’s words. It was easy to dismiss this all as propaganda, but it\nwas harder to dismiss the fact that Lindet would spread the exact same kind\nof propaganda throughout her own people.\nEveryone wanted to feel like they were the good guys, just as Styke had\nalways denied the unjust ferocity of the Mad Lancers within his own head.\nHe took Celine by the hand and led her back to Orz and Ka-poel. “Does\neveryone here think that we’re monsters?” he asked Orz.\n“Many of them, yes,” Orz admitted. “We have a very deep cultural"

        "text": "everyone here think that we’re monsters?” he asked Orz.\n“Many of them, yes,” Orz admitted. “We have a very deep cultural\nfeeling of superiority that goes back thousands of years. It’s not difficult to\nbuild upon that. They’re wrong, of course. I’ve seen your people and I\nbelieve they are no different from my own. That’s why I began this\ndiscussion.”\n“I don’t think I agree.”\n“Oh?”\n“At least, not personally.” He thought of those big, fallen puppets. “I am\na monster. I’ve had to be to protect my country. Just like you dragonmen.”\nOrz didn’t reply.\nStyke went on slowly. “I don’t intend on sticking around,” he said\nslowly. “Once I’ve found Ibana, we’re going to get in and out. Fight our\nway to the compound and take over the godstone, then defend it just long\nenough for Ka-poel to do her thing.” He didn’t mention his contingency\nplans—kidnapping the emperor, setting fires, fomenting chaos. He hoped\nthat it didn’t come to any of that. The faster they were able to destroy the\ngodstone, the better. But this little walk had also told him how the people of\nDynize felt about their godstone, and he wondered if the Mad Lancers\nwould flee the city at the head of a mob once they’d destroyed the thing.\nThey’d have to deal with that when it came up.\n“Let’s go,” Orz said, leading them away from the imperial compound\nand back the way they’d come. They turned off a main avenue and\nproceeded down a narrow causeway until they were practically alone in the\nmiddle of the lake, between two of the islands of city. Orz pointed. “Do you\nsee that small street jutting into the water over there?”\nStyke picked it out. “Yes.”\n“That’s where my mother and father live. And that there”—he swept his\nfinger across the water, up the shoreline, and centered it on a walled\ncompound about a mile from the godstone—“that is my old Household. My\nbrother runs it now.”\n“He has an entire compound?”\n“Pay attention, and you’ll see them dotted all over the city. Hundreds.\nMy brother’s is one of the smaller ones, to be honest. His name is Etzi, and\nhe is the Minister of Drainage.”\nStyke snorted.\n“Don’t laugh! It’s a small Household but an important job. Etzi’s task is\nto keep the city from flooding during the wet months or the lake from\ndraining during the dry. He oversees sewage and the hunting of swamp\ndragons that make their way into the lake.”\n“How are we going to convince your brother to abandon his Household\nand go into hiding?”\n“We won’t. I don’t even want him to know we’re here.”\n“Then, why show me?”\n“I want you to avoid that compound when you invade.”\n“Ah.”\n“I don’t want my brother involved. He is not like my parents—he loved\nour emperor, and he took some convincing to reconcile with Sedial when\nour emperor was assassinated. But he has a good life now. I’m not even\ngoing to speak to him before we leave.”\n“He’s not in danger from Sedial?”"

He’s too important…” Orz trailed off, his eyes fixing\non the horizon just above the city, staring at nothing. “This is the cost of\nbeing a ‘monster,’” he said quietly. “It is losing all you love. I recommend\nthat you regain your humanity as much as you can, Ben Styke.” Before\nStyke could answer, he cleared his throat. “Come, let us return to the inn.\nWe’ll need some rest before we go to fetch my parents tonight.”\nCHAPTER 22\nM\nichel spent the better part of the next day with Dahre’s crew, canvassing\nthe Depths for alternative leads and discussing the best plan of attack for\ncornering Mama Palo. He made plausible excuses to slip out of the quarry\nto make his own arrangements—studying maps, walking out an escape\nroute, and even buying a pistol. He kept Ichtracia close in case the whole\nthing went badly.\nAgainst his own instincts he began to fill her in on his plans. Things\nwere moving too quickly now to keep her entirely in the dark. She took the\nexplanations in stride, weathering them as she had everything else, with a\nsteely-eyed acceptance and, maybe hidden beneath it all, a touch of nerves.\nThey returned to their apartment at dark. Michel went over everything in\nhis head again and again as he lay in bed, listening to Ichtracia’s gentle\nsnores. His own nerves, he decided, were too thinly strung by the\nuncertainty of all this.\nMichel was just beginning to drift off when the sound of footsteps in the\nhall brought him back to wakefulness. It took him a moment of confusion to\nfigure out what his subconscious was telling him—dozens of people walked\nback and forth down this hall every day, after all. The steps, he decided, had\nvery definitely stopped outside of their door.\nHe’d only just made this connection when he heard another noise—the\nclick of a latch. In an instant Michel’s adrenaline was pumping, his heart\nhammering. A thousand explanations passed through his head as to why\nsomeone might be coming into their room unannounced: an innocent\nmistake, an assassin, a message from Emerald. It was the second that he\nfeared, though he wasn’t entirely sure who would try to kill him. If it was\nthe Dynize, they’d have just swarmed the building with soldiers and kicked\nthe door in.\nAll of this flashed through his mind in the few moments it took for the\ndoor to open. It happened quickly enough that he didn’t have the chance to\nso much as poke Ichtracia. Her steady, deep breathing continued beside\nhim, and he tensed himself, eyes open to slits, and watched the silhouette of\na figure appear in the doorway. His brand-new pistol was beneath the bed,\nout of reach, and unloaded anyway. His knuckledusters, however, were just\nbeneath his pillow.\nHe kept his own breathing steady so as not to betray his wakefulness as\na second figure appeared in the doorway. Michel caught sight of the very\ndistinct glint of a knife. The first figure paused by the foot of their mattress,\nturned back to the second. Something was whispered between them."

The first figure paused by the foot of their mattress,\nturned back to the second. Something was whispered between them.\nMichel lashed out with one foot, felt it connect with a knee. The figure\ncried out and tumbled to the floor. Michel was on his feet in a flash. He\nsnatched up his knuckledusters, trying to seat them onto the fingers of both\nhands while getting his bearings in the dark room. The first figure let out a\nstring of curses in Palo, while the second one attempted to leap at Michel\nbut was blocked by the flailing heap his companion had made on the floor.\nMichel saw another glint on the floor and stepped on the blade of a knife\nbefore it could be retrieved by its owner. He’d only just managed to do so\nwhen she surged to her feet, catching him in the stomach with her shoulder\nand throwing him hard against the wall. His breath was snatched from him\nin a wheezy grunt, and he pounded his fists on her back.\nThey wrestled for several moments, Michel’s attention fully on the\nwoman with her arms around his waist, when he felt fingers take a handful\nof his hair and jerk his head to one side. Something sharp touched his neck\nand he felt a bead of something wet on his skin—for the sparest of moments\nhe was convinced that his throat had been slashed. He froze, hand going to\nhis throat, but was shaken hard by the second attacker’s fingers in his hair.\n“Move,” a voice hissed, “and you’re a dead man.”\nMichel felt his eyes bugging out, his whole body trembling. He was far\nfrom a true fighter, and all their movements had been a frenetic scramble up\nto this point. That knife at his throat, however, had taken all the fight out of\nhim, and he found his body frozen in self-preservation. A small voice in the\nback of his head told him that he knew how this would go—a few questions\nand then a bloody smile. Fighting back was all he could do. But his limbs\nwouldn’t answer his commands.\nHe raised both hands and sagged against the wall. The figure at his waist\npulled away and stood up, and in a moment of shock, Michel caught sight\nof her face in the light of the hall. Devin-Mezi. He let out a disbelieving\nscoff. “What the pit?”\n“Wake your friend up,” Devin-Mezi ordered. “We’re going for a walk.\nGet the door,” she told her companion. “And the light.” She took control of\nthe knife at Michel’s throat, then tugged his knuckledusters off his splayed\nfingers. The man closed the door behind him and reached over their heads\nto turn up the lantern. Two things struck Michel the moment there was\nenough light to see by:\nThe first was that her companion was none other than Kelinar—the very\nsame turncoat who’d offered to sell Mama Palo’s whereabouts to Meln-\nDun’s searchers. Michel barely had time to register this when he noted that\nIchtracia was not only awake but sitting up.\nAnd she was wearing her gloves.\nKelinar’s left arm snapped backward, the bone splitting through the\nflesh and splattering blood across the wall.

He tried to reach for his arm but\nfroze in place, his mouth opened in a soundless scream. The knife flew out\nof Devin-Mezi’s hand and clattered against the wall. She, too, froze in\nplace, though both of her hands still appeared to be able to move. She\nclawed at her throat, unable to make a sound.\nThe two assailants remained suspended that way for several moments\nbefore Michel was able to get the thundering of his heart under control. He\npushed Devin-Mezi away from himself and took control of both of their\nknives. There was a thumping on the wall.\n“You there, quiet down! Some of us have to sleep!”\n“Sorry,” Michel called back. “Right away!”\nA few choice curses came back through the wall, and then silence. “Let\nthem breathe,” Michel said quietly to Ichtracia. She still sat in bed, her\nfingers twitching gently, her face screwed up into the kind of mild\nannoyance one might feel upon losing a small amount of money at the horse\nraces. She gave him a curt nod, and Devin-Mezi and Kelinar both took in a\nsudden gasp of air. Kelinar collapsed to the ground, curling up around his\nruined arm, while Devin-Mezi sank against the wall.\n“Scream,” Ichtracia said, “and I will pop your heads like boils.\nUnderstand?”\nDevin-Mezi nodded urgently. Kelinar trembled and dry-heaved,\nclutching at his shattered arm.\nMichel tried not to look at the blood pooling beneath Kelinar. His own\nhands trembled from the rush of the fight and he had to take several deep\nbreaths to steady himself. He could break down later. Now he had to ask\nquestions. He shifted his gaze to Devin-Mezi. “Who the pit are you, and\nwhy did you just try to knife us?”\nThe would-be assassin stared at Ichtracia, wide-eyed, her fingers\ntrembling. Michel had to remind himself what it was like for a civilian to\ncome across a Privileged—terrifying at best.\n“Didn’t go how you expected it, did it?”\nDevin-Mezi shook her head. “We weren’t going to knife you,” she\nwhispered. “Just ask some questions.”\n“And what were you going to do after asking questions?” Michel shot\nback. He knew how this worked. Go for a walk, she’d said. That was\nBlackhat shorthand for Make them walk to their own grave.\nDevin-Mezi shook her head again.\n“Why were you trying to knife us?” Michel asked again, this time\nfirming up his tone. He let the silence hang for two beats before adding, “If\nyou don’t start answering questions, I’m going to have my friend do the\nsame thing to each of your fingers as she did to his arm.”\n“Too competent,” Devin-Mezi muttered. “Too quick.”\n“You want to explain that?”\nShe spoke under her breath, eyeballing Ichtracia a few moments before\nher jaw tightened and her eyes narrowed. “I’ll die first.”\nMichel worked through his own emotions for a few moments before he"

She didn’t look too eager to start\ntorturing people, and despite having sat through plenty of Blackhat\n“questionings,” he had no stomach for it himself. It would be, he decided, a\nlast resort. Ichtracia swung out of bed and he watched her dress absently,\nhis thoughts churning through cause and effect.\nThere was a chance that Devin-Mezi was a Blackhat. She might have\nrecognized him and decided to kill him. Any Blackhats left in the city\nwould certainly have reason to do so. That phrase, “Go for a walk,” was\ndefinitely Blackhat shorthand, but that didn’t necessarily mean anything. It\nwas commonly known around Landfall and might have easily been picked\nup by anyone who spent any time on the wrong side of the law.\nMaybe she was simply who she said she was. Perhaps one of Meln-\nDun’s people had recognized Michel as a Blackhat and they’d decided to\nbump him off. But again, this was the Depths. Meln-Dun, of all people,\nwouldn’t need to act in secret.\nSo if she wasn’t a Blackhat and she wasn’t working for Meln-Dun, who\nwas she?\nMichel glanced at Kelinar—a low-level lieutenant of Mama Palo’s\nwho’d agreed to sell out his comrades. Or was he? A few things clicked into\nplace, and Michel snorted a laugh. “You’re setting up Meln-Dun, aren’t\nyou?” Michel asked. Devin-Mezi looked at him sharply. It was all he\nneeded to see to confirm his suspicion. “You’re a mole. A plant. And this\npoor bastard is your accomplice.”\n“I don’t follow,” Ichtracia said. She was dressed now, and turned back\ntoward the other two with a sneer fixed on her lip.\n“My guess,” Michel said to her, keeping his eyes on Devin-Mezi, “is\nthat they both work for Mama Palo. She’s infiltrated Meln-Dun’s group and\nhas been guiding them toward a trap. Her friend here is the bait. What’s the\nplan, Devin-Mezi? To get Dahre and his crew into one spot and kill them\nall? Look, you’re going to have to say something eventually.” He glanced\nsignificantly at Ichtracia.\nDevin-Mezi followed his eyes. “More or less,” she finally said.\n“Pit.” Michel rubbed his eyes and touched his neck, where he found\nblood still dripping from a scratch there. It was beginning to sting. But\nnothing like poor Kelinar’s arm. “Where is Mama Palo?”\n“Do what you want,” Devin-Mezi snapped back. “I’m not going to tell\nyou.”\n“Haven’t you wondered why I’ve got a secret Privileged with me?”\nMichel demanded. “Has it occurred to you that maybe I’m not what I claim\nto be, either?”\n“We should kill them,” Ichtracia cut in. “They know what I am.”\nMichel couldn’t tell if she was being serious or helping him feed Devin-"

Either way… “Look, I’m trying to find Mama Palo for my own\npurposes. I’m only working for Meln-Dun to piggyback onto his search.\nUnderstand?”\nDevin-Mezi stared hard at him. “What are you, then? A Dynize agent?”\n“Hardly.”\n“I don’t believe you.”\n“Believe anything you want.” Michel shrugged. “But I don’t have a lot\nof time. This trap of yours, they plan on springing it tomorrow night?”\nShe didn’t answer, but he could see confirmation in her eyes. She\nglanced toward her knife still dangling from his hand. “You’ll have to kill\nus both,” she insisted. “I’m not giving you any answers.”\nMichel took a deep breath and glanced at Ichtracia. They were in a\nworld of hurt now. She’d used her sorcery, which would quite likely alert\nSedial—if not to their presence, then at least to the presence of a Privileged.\nDevin-Mezi also knew of their presence, even if she didn’t know who they\nwere. He knew he should cut his losses and leave her and her companion\nrotting in a ditch. But if he didn’t have the stomach for torture, he definitely\ndidn’t have the stomach for cold-blooded murder.\n“Let them go,” he told Ichtracia.\n“What?” Both Ichtracia and Devin-Mezi said the word at the same time,\nwith equal amounts of surprise.\n“I’m not going to torture you, and I’m not going to kill you,” Michel\nsaid. “You don’t believe me, but we’re on the same side. So instead of\ndrawing this out any longer, I’m going to let you go. Take your friend there\nto get his arm seen to, then go inform Mama Palo that I’m trying to find\nher.”\n“She doesn’t know you,” Devin-Mezi replied, suspicion dripping from\nthe words.\n“She should,” Michel replied. He didn’t know who the new Mama Palo\nwas. He could only hope it was someone high enough up the organization to\nknow his name, or the names of one of his aliases. His own, he decided,\nwas too risky to give out. Instead he gave one of the latter. “Tell her that\nPuffer is trying to come in. He wants to talk, and he wants to talk soon.”\n“Puffer?” Devin-Mezi asked. “Like the fish?”\n“Exactly like the fish. It’s an old code name of mine. If Mama Palo has\nbeen around long enough, she’ll know it.” Michel jerked his head toward\nKelinar. “Go on, before I change my mind. I’ll be here for three hours.\nCome back and find me once you get an answer. Come alone.” He ignored\nIchtracia’s doubtful expression and watched while Devin-Mezi collected\nher companion off the floor. Kelinar was still sobbing quietly when she led\nhim out the door. Michel stepped into the hallway and watched until they\nwere gone, then darted back into the room.\n“What the pit was that?” Ichtracia asked, removing her gloves."

Michel stepped into the hallway and watched until they\nwere gone, then darted back into the room.\n“What the pit was that?” Ichtracia asked, removing her gloves.\n“That was me trying to make contact,” Michel answered. “I appreciate\nyour intervention, but we need to move.” He immediately began to throw\ntheir things into his shoulder bag. Ichtracia followed suit, collecting her\nmeager possessions into her pockets and handing him her one extra set of\nclothes.\n“Where are we going? I thought you told her we’d be here.”\n“This building has two exits. There’s a decent spot up three levels where\nwe can see both of them. We’re going to go spend the rest of the night\nthere.”\n“And if she comes back with more assassins?”\n“Then we disappear,” Michel replied. “And all our plans will be ruined.”\nCHAPTER 23\nV\nlora patrolled the hastily assembled Adran camp. Per her orders, they\nwere set up in the hills just off the Cape, so close to the Dynize that she\ncould see the light from their campfires flickering against the low cloud\ncover to her west. Recklessly close. If the terrain had been flat and visibility\ngood, the Dynize would have been able to open fire with their field guns\nand abuse Vlora’s camp all through the night—but their choice of rough\nterrain had limited their own options, which Vlora used against them.\nThe reason for camping so close was clear—it meant that Vlora could\nforce a battle at first light, keeping the sunrise at her back to blind her\nenemies. Her men would barely have to roll out of bed to start the battle,\nmeaning they’d be as fresh as possible and ready for a day of bloody line\nfighting and bayonet charges. The lack of space left the Dynize with little\nroom to practice subterfuge or maneuver.\nAt least, Vlora hoped those were the fears going through her enemy’s\nminds. The reality, if they had somehow managed to grasp it, was far more\nridiculous.\nVlora managed to keep herself upright due to a combination of coffee,\ncatnaps in the saddle, and no small amount of bloodthirsty energy. By all\nrights she should be on her back in her tent, looking for ten hours of sleep\nbefore she dared a major battle. But she didn’t have that kind of luxury, so\nshe turned all of her anger, grief, and hatred into single-minded eagerness. It\nwas time to meet the Dynize in battle—for real this time—and to show\nthem what it meant to fight an Adran army.\nVlora’s camp was laid out in a half-moon shape. To the west were the\nnewcomers—the Dynize reinforcements of some thirty thousand infantry.\nTo her northwest was General Etepali’s field army. Vlora had made a great\nshow of digging in—fortifications on all sides of her camp—but had set the\nbulk of her engineers on that northwest side. It was the side that she was\nmost worried about.\nHer inspection of the Adran camp was swift, beginning just after\nnightfall and ending at the general-staff tent.

The tent was packed with officers from colonel to\nbrigadier general, as well as her three powder mages, Nila and Bo, and\nBrown Bear Burt.\nConversation ceased when she entered. She returned the offered salutes\nand let her gaze wander around the space for a few moments. Expressions\nranged from eager to steely, and it was in the eyes of the latter she could see\nthat some of her senior officers had begun to get an inkling of how furious\nshe really was.\nGeneral Sabastenien was closest at hand. “How is everyone holding\nup?” she asked him.\n“Troops? Or officers?”\n“Both,” she answered in a voice loud enough to include everyone in the\ntent in the conversation.\n“Troops are good. The Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth have all spent the\nlast few hours resting per your orders. There’s some trepidation over a night\nattack. No one likes the risk of accidentally bayoneting their friend because\nthey can’t see a damned thing.”\n“Of course. And the officers?”\nA brief moment of hesitation. “About the same.”\nVlora met the answer with a small smile and took in the room again with\nher gaze. “I understand that the order of battle tonight is… unorthodox.\nThere will be confusion. There will be friendly fire. If you have questions or\nreservations, now is the time to voice them.”\nA cacophony erupted from the officers. Vlora quieted them with a raised\nhand and began addressing the questions one at a time—working through\npreparations, the plan of attack, and all the way through a dozen different\ncontingencies. The questions seemed to be gently geared toward finding out\nwhether Vlora had gone completely insane or not. By the end of it most of\nthe officers seemed satisfied, though not necessarily pleased with the idea\nof sending four brigades of infantry on a night attack.\nOnce the questions were over, she dismissed the officers to see to their\nbrigades, leaving her with the Privileged and powder mages. She addressed\nthe mages. “Have the three of you found your vantage points?”\nThey nodded. Davd avoided her gaze. He hadn’t said a word to her since\nshe shouted him away yesterday. A part of her knew that she should\napologize—he was just the bearer of bad news. But her stubborn streak\nremained firm, her voice clipped and impersonal.\n“You’re sure about leaving you without a mage?” Norrine asked\ndoubtfully.\n“Yes, I’m sure,” Vlora responded. “I’m staying on the edge of our camp\nwith a bodyguard. I’ll be fine.”\n“But you can’t see in the dark without your sorcery,” Norrine pointed\nout. “You’ll be blind.”\n“No more blind than they are,” Vlora countered. “Besides, once things\nhave started, I won’t be issuing commands. This is one battle I need to just\npoint in the right direction and then cut loose.”\n“That’s awfully cavalier,” Bo said, looking at his fingernails.\n“Can you think of any alternatives?” she asked.

She’d briefed them all\nearlier on Burt’s message and the mysterious artifact the Dynize had\nrecovered from Yellow Creek. They’d all agreed it was imperative to find it\nand steal it. “If we sit on our thumbs, we risk letting the Dynize get away\nwith that thing.”\n“Why can’t we attack in the morning?” Bo drawled.\n“Because they’re expecting just that,” Vlora responded. “Did you not\nhear the entire question-and-answer session I just had with my officers? Or\nwere you dozing off?”\n“He was dozing off,” Nila interjected.\nVlora turned her attention on Nila but held her temper in check. She had\nthe type of relationship with Bo that would allow her to be cross with him\nbut stay friends in the morning. Nila, on the other hand, would take it more\npersonally. “I don’t want the two of you participating in the attack.”\nBo arched an eyebrow.\n“It’ll be too chaotic,” Vlora explained. “It’s already going to be bad\nenough without slinging sorcery around. No, when the signal goes off, I\nwant you to help Colonel Silvia with the lights.”\n“You’re going to use us as a couple of giant lanterns?” Nila asked flatly.\n“No. I’m also going to put you in the northwest corner of the camp.\nYou’re going to be there when General Etepali counterattacks.”\n“When?”\n“When,” Vlora confirmed. “I’m not just expecting her to slam into us\nfrom the flank, I’m counting on it. You’re going to make sure she gets a\nface full of shit when she does it.”\n“And the other Privileged?” Bo asked.\nVlora jerked her thumb at her powder mages. “They’ll be dead before\nthey can bring their real strength to bear on us.”\nThe group reluctantly agreed to Vlora’s orders, and she sent them\nscattering out after her officers. Vlora found herself alone for the first time\nin days and sank down into one of the chairs in the general-staff tent,\nrubbing her eyes. Every fiber of her being throbbed with pain and\nexhaustion. Each time she moved a limb, she could practically hear it\nscreaming in protest. She’d pushed herself plenty harder before, but never\nwithout the benefit of her sorcery.\nShe steeled her resolve. She had no choice. She could not allow\nanything as petty as human weakness to slow her down.\nShe closed her eyes briefly, thinking of Olem. She wondered where he’d\ngone. What he was thinking. Had it been so easy for him to cut loose from\nher? Had she hurt him so badly? She wished he was here so that she could\napologize to him. She wondered if he’d accept the apology—or if there was\nnothing she could say or do to make things better.\nShe remained in black contemplations until a messenger arrived to tell\nher it was time.\nThe night was tinged with just a sliver of moonlight peeking through the\nclouds.

It wasn’t ideal—a full moon on a cloudless night would have made\nit easier for her soldiers to keep from shooting one another in the attack—\nbut she intended to use that confusion against the enemy. She allowed a\nmessenger to guide her to the edge of camp while her eyes adjusted to the\ndark, where she found thousands of her soldiers kneeling quietly. The only\nsounds were the whispered orders of officers and the creak of leather gear\nand rattle of the occasional rifle.\nIf there were any nearby Dynize scouts, they would be mighty\nsuspicious. But her powder mages had already swept the region between\nher camp and the enemy, putting spies and picketmen to the knife.\nSome time passed, and Vlora’s eyes grew more accustomed to the night.\nA messenger moved cautiously up a broken trail to her position. “General\nFlint?” a voice asked.\n“Here.”\n“Everyone has reported in, ma’am.”\n“Officers have hooded lanterns and pocket watches?”\n“Yes, ma’am.” The messenger thrust one of each into Vlora’s hands. The\nlantern was covered, betraying only the smallest bit of light in the cracks of\nits construction. She held the pocket watch up to it. Almost one in the\nmorning. She kept her eyes glued to the hands of the watch, counting down\nthe minutes, then the seconds.\nThe watch had barely struck one-ten when hushed orders rippled off to\neither side of her, spreading across the front. A whisper of cloth and jangle\nof gear followed as the group set off. Vlora stood in the darkness, watching\nthe glint of steel in the moonlight and the occasional glow of an officer’s\nlantern descend slowly over the ridgeline and then down into the first of\ntwo steep, narrow valleys that separated her camp from the Dynize.\nHer blood hammered in her ears with the anticipation of it all, and the\nbleakness of her earlier thoughts felt like an itch that covered her body. She\nneeded action to scratch that itch. But she’d done her part—made the plans,\ngiven the orders—and now had nothing to do but wait.\n“Pit be damned,” she whispered to her small bodyguard of ten infantry.\n“I’m not sitting back here for this. Let’s go kill some tin-heads.” She was\nmoving before she’d finished talking, scrambling up and over the ridge\nwhile her bodyguard struggled to keep up. She joined the infantry moving\ndown into the first ravine. She moved mechanically, not allowing herself to\nacknowledge the aches and pains. She was halfway to the top of that third\nridge when she realized how bad of an idea this was.\nBut she had gone too far. She was going in with her soldiers.\nThey reached the top of that ridge. Vlora almost tripped over a body,\nthroat slit from ear to ear looking like a great black grin in the sallow\nmoonlight. It was a Dynize sentry. She left the corpse behind and lifted her\neyes to the Dynize camp.\nIt was still, but not silent. Soldiers and camp followers moved about in\nthe shadows of their campfires, taking a piss or mending uniforms by\nfirelight or just restless on the day before the battle. She was close enough"

Soldiers and camp followers moved about in\nthe shadows of their campfires, taking a piss or mending uniforms by\nfirelight or just restless on the day before the battle. She was close enough\nto hear snores. Someone sang softly nearby. All around her, Adran soldiers\ncrouched at the ready, breath held as they waited practically on top of the\nenemy.\nShe felt a momentary pang. This wasn’t going to be a battle. There was\nno honor or justice in this.\nThat pang was cut off by a heavy thumping sound. Another followed it,\nand then another, too close together to count. The air was filled with a\ndistant squeal that grew steadily louder until suddenly a blossom of red\nlight erupted above their heads. It was joined by another, and another, until\nthe sky was full of flares.\nA nearby sergeant, a woman’s voice, bellowed in Adran, “Like pigs in a\npen, boys. Charge!”\nVlora drew her sword and allowed herself to be swept forward by the\nsudden rush of the infantry.\nCHAPTER 24\nS\ntyke waited until his small group of Lancers had drunk themselves past\nthe ability to do much damage. Then he slipped out the side door of the\ninn’s bunkhouse, rounded behind the latrines, and met Orz on the side of the\nroad. The dragonman wore long sleeves and a cape and hood to cover his\ntattoos. He seemed to blend with the shadows effortlessly. Styke hoped that\ntheir outing didn’t require too much stealth, as he had neither the training\nnor the size for sneaking.\nOrz handed him a hood. “Over your head,” he said quietly. “Just to keep\nyour face hidden. The fewer questions asked, the better.”\n“Are we going to run into any problems?” Styke asked, following\ninstructions.\n“We shouldn’t. The curfew for slaves is at dusk. If we’re actually\nstopped, it should be enough that you’re with me. But I’d prefer not to be\nbothered.”\n“Right.” The dragonman had managed to acquire for Styke some local\nclothing big enough to fit him—cream-colored pants and jacket accented\nwith turquoise and sapphire. The clothes were much looser than anything\nhe’d ever worn and he’d spent the last couple of hours wearing them in the\nhope that some practice would keep him from tripping on all the hanging\ncloth. He pulled the sleeves down to his wrists and shoved his hands into\nhis pockets. “I’ll do what I can not to be noticed.”\nOrz gave him a wry glance. “Will they be fine without us?” he asked,\njerking his head to the inn behind them.\n“Should be,” Styke replied. “Jackal is in charge. He doesn’t drink much\nthese days. Ka-poel is sober, and if I can count on anything these days, it’s\nthat those assholes jump at Celine’s word faster than they jump at mine.”\n“A daughter they never had?”\n“Lots of them have kids. Half of those died during the Revolution,\nmostly at Kez hands. They spoil her, but she’s too clever to let that go to her\nhead.” Styke adjusted the fall of his loose pants, took a couple of\nexperimental steps. “Are we going far?”"

They spoil her, but she’s too clever to let that go to her\nhead.” Styke adjusted the fall of his loose pants, took a couple of\nexperimental steps. “Are we going far?”\n“It’s a couple of miles.” Orz pointed to the south. “My parents, if they’re\nstill there, live just on the other side of the palace. When my brother took\nover the Household, they had a falling out. My mother picked a spot to live\nclose enough that she could scrutinize anything he did but far enough away\nthat she wasn’t technically under his influence or protection. Shall we?”\nStyke gestured for Orz to lead, and fell into step just a half pace behind\nthe dragonman, remembering what Celine had told him earlier. He kept his\nhead bent, shoulders hunched, with the hood pulled far enough forward to\nshadow his face without obscuring his vision. He watched Orz’s shoulders\nfor a few moments, noticing a hurriedness to his stride that hadn’t been\nthere before—a trace of nerves, perhaps—and then turned his attention to\nmemorizing landmarks and street names.\n“Do you get along with your parents?” he asked.\nOrz shot a glance over his shoulder.\n“I’d like to know what we’re walking into,” Styke explained.\nOrz snorted. “I do not. Not with my parents, nor with my brother.”\n“Any good reason?” Styke chewed on his words, thinking them over.\nHe’d never been one for talking about this sort of thing. But it seemed\nnecessary. “Or just old family wounds? I’m familiar with both.”\n“I don’t even remember the old family wounds. Small things that made\nus hate each other, I’m sure. But the schism between us—my brother and\nme—and my parents is deeper than that. When my emperor…” He paused,\nclearing his throat as they were passed by a handful of men and women\ngiggling among themselves on a night out. “When our emperor was\nmurdered, my parents switched sides. Not just pragmatically as adherence\nto the treaty, but with enthusiasm. They gave their minds, hearts, and souls\nover to Ka-Sedial within hours of the news. Not even a grain of remorse.\nThey bullied my brother into doing the same. I couldn’t forgive them for\nthat.”\nThis new bit of knowledge set off warning bells in the back of Styke’s\nhead. “You’re sure this is a good idea, then? How do we know they won’t\nturn you over to Ka-Sedial’s people the moment we show our heads?”\n“We don’t.”\nStyke reached out and seized Orz by the arm without even thinking\nabout it, jerking the dragonman to a stop. Orz whirled on him. “I’m helping\nyou do this because you brought us out of the jungle. But if they turn on us\n—if this comes back to my men…”\nOrz looked down at Styke’s arm, nostrils flaring. “I will not allow it to\ncome back to your men. I’m not going in blind. I know that they may betray\nus and I will be watchful. If they do not agree to come immediately, we will\nleave them behind.”\n“You’re sure?”\n“I’m sure.”\n“And your brother? Are you going to warn him?”"

My brother is well liked and supports Ka-Sedial publicly.” He raised\nhis gaze to meet Styke’s eyes. “I don’t do this because I am a fool. I have\nfriends—people I knew in my youth who I haven’t seen for ten years—who\nwill likely disappear because of my actions in Fatrasta. They’ll be tortured\nand killed. They may not even know why. But these are my parents. I have\nto at least try to spare them a similar fate.”\nStyke let his arm fall and they continued walking. He felt a tightness in\nhis chest now, a new wariness that went beyond being in a strange place.\nThis was a risk they didn’t need. But they wouldn’t have gotten this far\nwithout Orz. Styke owed him several times over now. No choice but to take\na deep breath and help him with the errand.\nAnd hope it all didn’t go tits up.\nThey passed around the outer walls of the palace and cut east, leaving\nthe wide avenues and entering an area that seemed to have more in common\nwith the suburbs of Landfall. The houses were smaller, closer together, each\nof them fronted by a road and backed by a canal, built on foundations of\nstone surrounded by packed dirt. The houses here were mostly light-colored\nbrick with reed-and-thatch roofs. The occasional group of children still\nplayed in the floating gardens despite the late hour. About half of the houses\nhad already gone to bed, while the others were lit by lanterns.\nThey turned onto a short road that wasn’t even a street anymore, just a\ndirt and gravel path that dead-ended at the water and was lined by more of\nthe closely packed brick houses. Orz stopped abruptly.\n“Do you see anything?” Styke searched the windows, roofs, and gardens\nof the dead end but saw nothing out of the ordinary.\nOrz shook his head. “If Ka-Sedial warned one of his puppets, then my\nparents are already dead. If not, then we have beaten Sedial’s men by at\nleast a week. Come. It is the second-to-last house on the left.”\nThe house was one of the few with a lantern still burning. As they\napproached, Styke caught sight of a single elderly woman sitting in a small\nroom furnished with a table, two chairs, and a small, clay stove. The woman\nmust have been in her late sixties, the freckles on her arms and face so thick\nthat her skin looked entirely ashen. The resemblance was immediately\napparent; she had the same cheekbones as Orz, the same thoughtful eyes.\nHer head was bowed over a length of knitting that extended between her\nknees and under the table.\nOrz examined the old woman without a trace of emotion crossing his\nface. He lifted one hand. “I will be no longer than ten minutes.” Without\nfurther explanation, he crossed to the door and stepped inside.

Orz rounded the table to stand beside her,\nputting one hand on her shoulder. “Where is Father?”\n“He’s dead. Five years now.”\nThe only response from Orz was a hard swallow. “They didn’t tell me.”\n“Because you are dead, too. If you didn’t escape, how are you here?\nWhy are you here?”\n“I was released. By Ka-Sedial.”\n“That’s a lie,” the old woman said, brushing his hand off her shoulder.\nStyke could see a flash of pain in Orz’s eyes and was tempted to look away.\nThis wasn’t a drama that should be witnessed by other parties. But he\nremained glued to the window, unable to stop watching.\n“It’s not,” Orz said stiffly. “Ka-Sedial released me. And then he betrayed\nme. I’ve come to warn you before he punishes you for my sins.”\n“I’ve already been punished for your sins,” the old woman snapped,\nfinally looking up at her son’s face. “We were ostracized. Humiliated. Your\nfather’s heart gave out from shame. That you would spit on our emperor.\nOur god!”\nStyke could see Orz drawing into himself throughout the lecture, his\neyes growing more distant, his jaw tightening. “He is not my emperor, and\nhe is far from a god. He is nothing but a puppet for Ka-Sedial, that…” He\nvisibly wrestled for control of himself. Farther up the path, Styke heard a\ndoor shut and a figure walk off toward the main street. He attempted to sink\ndeeper into the shadows.\nThe old woman suddenly shot to her feet, crossing the room as if it were\ndifficult to be so close to her son. “The war ended, Orz. Were you so in love\nwith it that you couldn’t stop fighting?”\n“Fighting?” Orz demanded, gesturing broadly to the east. “Do you think\nany of us stopped fighting? What do you think is going on at this very\nmoment? I came from Fatrasta, where our mighty armies are stripping a\nland that is not our own.”\n“Ours by right,” the old woman sniffed. She glared at her son, crossing\nto the table and unhooking the lantern. She took it with her and hung it in\nthe opposite window above the stove. She opened the stove and added a\nfew twigs, blowing life into some leftover coals. “I suppose you’re here,”\nshe said angrily. “I’ll make you tea.”\n“I’m not staying long enough for tea,” Orz replied coldly. “I came here\nto warn you. To take you away before you could be hurt.”\n“Take me away to where?” she replied bitterly.\n“Somewhere you can hide until this is over.”"

To take you away before you could be hurt.”\n“Take me away to where?” she replied bitterly.\n“Somewhere you can hide until this is over.”\n“Until what’s over?” She turned to peer at his face.\n“The war.”\n“To what end? You speak as if you expect us to lose. The treason—”\n“Realism is not treason, no matter what the bone-eye propagandists want\nyou to think,” Orz talked over her. “We may win. We may lose. Ka-Sedial\nhas attracted more attention than he cares to admit—I doubt you’re getting\nany truth of the war in our newspapers.”\n“We’re winning. What else do we need to know?”\nStyke marveled at the willful ignorance of the old woman. She clearly\nwasn’t stupid, but there was a set to her jaw that spoke of someone who had\ndecided how the world was and refused to let it change.\n“Kressian attention,” Orz said. “Fatrastan resistance. Military\ntechnology that we can’t match. I saw a lot in Fatrasta.” Styke thought he\ndetected a hint of something in Orz’s voice. As if he was trying to convince\nhimself that Ka-Sedial might lose.\n“It doesn’t matter,” the old woman said, snatching a pot down from\nabove the stove. “Here, fill this with water from the fountain, I—” Her\nwords were cut off by a cough, and several things happened at once. Styke\nsaw a flutter beyond the opposite window, then the deceivingly quiet shatter\nof the glass lantern. A familiar soft strumming sound was the next thing that\nregistered, causing the hair on Styke’s arms to stand on end.\nIn the same heartbeat, a hail of bolts slammed through the old woman,\nshredding her frail body. Styke flinched back, and when he raised his head\nback to the window, she was on the floor and Orz had stumbled back\nagainst the wall, clutching at his stomach. He had at least one bolt in his\nstomach, one in a shoulder, and another in his chest. Somehow, he stayed on\nhis feet.\nStyke had barely begun to move when the house next door suddenly\ndischarged six shadowy figures. They were dressed much like he was but in\ndarker clothes and carrying strange crossbows. Two took up stations on the\npath while a third kicked in the door.\nStyke froze. The group was so focused on Orz that none of them seemed\nto notice him kneeling in the dark.\nThrough the window, he watched in amazement as Orz’s bone knives\nappeared in his hands. The dragonman managed to cut down the first two\nassassins to enter the house. The third assassin casually braced himself and\nfired a pair of bolts point-blank into Orz from the pathway. Orz stumbled\nback, tripped, and fell over the table onto his mother’s corpse.\nThe third assassin stepped into the light, and Styke immediately spotted\nthe black tattoos on the man’s neck. This new dragonman grinned grimly\ndown at Orz. “You shouldn’t have come back, old friend.” Orz wheezed\nsomething in response. The dragonman bent over, picking up one of Orz’s\nknives from where it had been dropped. He gestured at Orz’s mother. “She"

He gestured at Orz’s mother. “She\nwas all too willing to help set the trap. A good woman. A loyal woman.\nShe’ll be remembered for that loyalty.”\nStyke ground his teeth at the sudden change of fortunes. None of the\nremaining assassins had noticed him yet—the dragonman was inside and\ntwo were crowded around the door, crossbows held at the ready. The fourth\nwas checking on her fallen comrades. The way Styke saw it, he could cut\nand run and hope none of them noticed his departure. He’d have to get back\nto the inn, sober everyone up, and get them moving. Then hope that Ka-poel\ncould take Orz’s place as their Dynize figurehead and get them safely to the\nMad Lancer rendezvous.\nIt was the smart thing. Orz had done a lot for them, but he hadn’t done\nenough to warrant a fight with another dragonman. Besides, with so many\ncrossbow bolts in him he looked like a hedgehog. He was dead already.\nStyke’s heart fluttered. He remembered Orz’s refusal to fight him over\nhis mother’s grave. He felt the injustice of Orz having to watch his own\nmother die. His fingers twitched, teeth clenched.\n“Shit,” he whispered, discarding his hood and drawing his knife.\nThe two assassins at the door didn’t even have the chance to turn. He\npunched his knife through the neck of the one on the left, withdrew it in one\nquick motion, and slammed it hard into the other’s kidneys. He put his\nshoulder to the man’s back and lifted him, charging forward with the body\nas a shield.\nThe dragonman danced aside—or attempted to. Styke arrested his\ncharge just a few steps into the room and, with one palm outstretched,\nshoved the dying assassin off the end of his knife and into the dragonman,\nwho had nowhere to dodge in such a tight space.\nThe fourth assassin was on her feet by the time Styke turned. She raised\nher crossbow, catching the blade of his knife across the stock. He reached\npast both weapons with his left hand and snatched her by the throat,\nwhipping her around and tossing her at the dragonman. The dragonman,\nextricating himself from the first body Styke threw at him, simply ducked\nand darted at Styke fast as a bullet.\nStyke managed to catch the dragonman by the wrist, blocking a knife\nheaded for his ribs, while the dragonman did the same to his own knife\nhand. The two remained locked that way for several seconds, struggling in a\ncontest of strength. Styke felt his arms begin to tremble and had a brief\nvision of Ka-poel’s smug face looking down at his corpse.\nHe slammed his forehead against the dragonman’s nose. The\ndragonman’s head snapped back, blood exploding across both their faces.\nStyke managed to bury an inch of his Boz knife into the dragonman’s thigh,\nwhile the tip of the bone knife zigzagged a bloody line down his own arm.\nThey spun, grappling, tripping and slipping on the corpses.

Styke jerked his\nknife downward and sideways to open the wound, using the momentum to\nshove the dragonman backward against the now-hot stove.\nNeither the sudden smell of cooking flesh nor the knife tearing through\nhis thigh brought more than a grunt from the dragonman. Styke tried to lean\nharder, working his blade for an artery, but the dragonman suddenly slipped\nto one side and rolled backward across the stove and out the very window\nthe crossbow bolts had come through less than a minute before.\nShouts came from the street, and Styke could picture the dragonman\ngoing for one of those strange crossbows. Kicking the dying assassins out\nof his path, he snatched Orz by the back of his shirt and lifted him onto one\nshoulder as he ran through the front door. He caught sight of people\nstanding on the path, gawking at him, as well as a single shadowy figure in\nthe space between the houses. Styke didn’t waste time trying to get a closer\nlook. Jamming his knife into its sheath, he sprinted for the end of the road.\n“I hope whatever bone-eye sorcery they carve into you guys keeps the\nswamp dragons away,” he huffed as he ran. He threw Orz ahead of him just\nas his feet left firm ground and he turned the leap into a sloppy dive, hitting\nthe dark, murky water hard enough to take the breath out of him.\nCHAPTER 25\nV\nlora stumbled through the chaotic haze of the Dynize camp, choking on\nsmoke and bewildered by the harsh glow of flares combined with the\nflickering flames from burning tents. It was all too much to process, shapes\nand shadows leaping through the night as Dynize staggered from their tents\nonly to be bayoneted by a wave of Adran soldiers.\nThis was the first time Vlora had fought in a battle without her sorcery\n—ever—and it was the absolute worst circumstances she could have\nchosen. She had no conditioning for this sort of thing, no experience with\nthe heightened cacophony of bloodshed, for the confusing nature of the\nsounds and sights of a fight in the dark. Her sorcery would have slowed it\nall down, given her time to think and adjust. Without it she felt as helpless\nas a fresh recruit, and it terrified her.\n“Ma’am! One of our Knacked has located a bone-eye!” someone\nshouted in her ear.\nVlora tried to rein in her senses, to grasp enough of what was going on\naround her to give orders. Her bodyguard consisted of ten grenadiers—eight\nmen and two women, the biggest and meanest of her infantry corps. Joining\nthe fray had essentially cut them loose, and they expected her to sweep\nalong with them as they joined in the bloody slaughter. She could see the\nconfused looks in their eyes when she didn’t move readily, react quickly,\nand bark orders. She wasn’t behaving like a powder mage, and they knew it.\n“Where?” she demanded, focusing on one of the grenadiers. “Lead on!”\nShe struggled to keep up as they began to jog through the smoke.

An officer emerged from the haze, half-\ndressed and waving a sword. Her grenadiers swarmed him before he even\nhad the chance to call out.\n“Here, ma’am,” one of the grenadiers barked, running toward a tent. She\ncould see a shape inside, the silhouette struggling to buckle on a breastplate.\n“Take care of it.”\nThe order was carried out quickly and savagely, bayonets pincushioning\nthe hapless bone-eye in his own tent, then dragging him out into the light,\nwhere someone slit his throat to make sure the job was finished. Vlora\nfound herself horrified at the process.\nShe couldn’t help but wonder if her sorcery had given her some sort of\ncushion against these horrors. Had it calcified her? Kept her from seeing the\nblood of battle for what it truly was? Or was this something different—\nnothing that could be called a battle. These Dynize weren’t even vaguely\nready to defend themselves. Her soldiers poured over them with ease. She\nturned her attention on her surroundings, looking at the faces in the\nflickering light. Some of them attacked the helpless infantry in their tents\nwith childish joy. Most seemed steely-eyed, acting with methodical,\nmechanical effort. They knew that every soldier they didn’t kill was one\nthat would have the opportunity to shoot back at them in the morning.\nVlora grasped onto that thought. This was the right thing to do, wasn’t\nit? Minimizing danger to her own people was all that mattered. The Dynize\ninfantry were just so many sacks of meat to churn through.\n“Ma’am! Ma’am!”\nVlora focused on the face of one of her female grenadiers. She realized\nthat she didn’t even know any of their names. These people were here to\nprotect her life. How could she not have bothered to learn who they were?\n“Are you all right, ma’am?”\n“Yes, yes. What is it?”\nThe grenadier pointed to the horizon. It took a few moments for Vlora to\ntell the difference between the various lights in the sky—sorcerous\nconflagrations had now joined the flares. An experienced eye was good\nenough to see that this wasn’t just Nila and Bo adding to the fireworks;\nthey’d gotten into it with someone, likely General Etepali’s Privileged. “Bo\nand Nila are on it,” she told the grenadier. “Focus on this camp.”\n“Yes, ma’am!”\nAs the night wore on, the mood of the conflict shifted. Pockets of\nDynize appeared, usually organized by a sole officer, offering token\nresistance to the rampaging Adrans. Vlora pushed herself through her own\nmuddled mind, urging her bodyguard toward these pockets, making sure\nthey put them down as quickly as possible to keep the Dynize from forming\na coherent backbone.\nSorcery continued to rage on the northern horizon, and it helped Vlora\norient herself in the confusion.

She learned through these that\nEtepali had indeed counterattacked. Her Privileged had engaged Bo and\nNila and her infantry was pushing hard at Vlora’s flank. So far, the men\nshe’d left to protect those heavy fortifications had managed to hold the line.\nShe lost all track of time and space. One of her grenadiers fell to a\nDynize officer. Soldiers in one of those pockets of resistance had managed\nto leave her limping with two new cuts on her left thigh. Her own inability\nto do more than raise her sword left her with an inner terror and the\ncontinuing knowledge that she shouldn’t be here in the thick of things. She\nrisked not just her life but also her reputation.\nShe shoved herself onward, forcing herself to be an avatar that she\ndidn’t feel she was any longer, pushing harder toward those pockets of\nresistance. She even began to run, shouting at her men. It felt surreal, like\nshe was floating above herself and watching someone else control her body.\nVlora was so caught up in the chaos around her that she barely noticed\nthe orange-lacquered breastplate on a Dynize officer less than twenty feet\nfrom her. She had to backpedal mentally, turning her head toward that\nbreastplate, words of caution on her lips.\nThe enemy general was a small man with a long, braided mustache. He\nwore the morion helm and lacquered breastplate, and he shook a\ncavalryman’s sword over his head. His eyes fell on Vlora at almost the same\nmoment that she looked back to examine him, and the two froze in the heat\nof the moment. Unfortunately for Vlora, the general’s bodyguard was\nquicker.\nTwo forms erupted from the night, hitting her grenadiers like a pair of\ncannonballs. She saw flashes of bone knives, of ashen-freckled bare chests\ncovered with snaking black tattoos. The dragonmen cut through three of her\ngrenadiers before the group even had the chance to react.\n“Form up!” Vlora yelled, far too late. “Dragonmen on the left flank;\nkeep them at the tips of your bayonets!” She threw herself backward,\ndropping her sword and snatching up the bayoneted rifle of a fallen\ngrenadier. For the first time all night, her vague feelings of stupidity burned\ninto something sharper—the terror of knowing she could die within\nmoments.\nA bayonet skewered one of the dragonmen through the belly, but the\ndragonman barely flinched, using the opportunity to jerk the grenadier\ncloser and slice her throat with one of his knives. He soon fell to the\nbayonets of the others, but the gap gave his companion the opening he\nneeded to slide around to the side of the mass of grenadiers, hitting them in\nthe flank. All but two went down, and those last threw themselves between\nthe dragonman and Vlora with a pair of angry roars.

She stood stupidly with the recovered rifle\nhanging loose from numb fingers as the last of her grenadiers fell to a\ndragonman’s knife. The enemy general stood just behind his champion,\nshouting something in Dynize, waving that saber at Vlora. The dragonman\nhad not come out of the fight unscathed—he was covered in cuts, stabbed\nthrough at least twice. He would have been an easy target if Vlora had had\nher sorcery, and perhaps an even fight even if she was in better health.\nThe dragonman brushed off his wounds and began to stalk toward Vlora.\nIt took all of her courage to stand firm, renewing her grip on the rifle in her\nhands. They circled each other for a few moments before the dragonman\nducked and lunged, coming in under the point of her bayonet, knife flashing\nforward. She backpedaled hard, feeling the blade nick through her jacket\nand flesh. She tripped, slid, and fell so hard that the dragonman stumbled\nover and past her.\nFlashes of the battle of the Crease passed through Vlora’s mind, those\nmoments when she knew her fate was sealed hitting her between the eyes.\nHer hands trembled. She clutched the rifle to her chest, trying to get a good\nenough grip on it to stab upward at the dragonman who now loomed over\nher, knife poised for the killing blow.\nThere was a sudden thunder in her ears, and her eyes filled with the flash\nof hooves. She shook and shivered in the onslaught, not daring to move. As\nquickly as they arrived, the hooves were gone, and she craned her neck to\nwatch the rear of a platoon of Adran cuirassiers as they thundered back into\nthe fire-licked darkness.\nThe dragonman and his general were both gone. Vlora slowly staggered\nto her feet, casting about until she found her opponents—both of them\nreduced to a pulp beneath Adran hooves. She widened her gaze, taking in\nthe horror of her slaughtered bodyguard, and then further to look around at\nthe bodies of Dynize infantrymen that coated the grounds of their camp for\nas far as she could see.\nShe bent and was sick all over her own boots. Clawing at her throat,\ntrying to breathe, she began to stagger back to camp.\nHistory, she realized in a moment of clarity, would call this a victory.\nCHAPTER 26\nM\nichel and Ichtracia moved to a damp overhanging roof that viewed the\nexits of their former safe house. It was recessed beneath another walk, a\ngood place to watch without being seen, but wildly uncomfortable. Ichtracia\nsettled down next to him and scowled into the darkness, placing one hand\non his knee. He reached down and squeezed it.\n“You all right?” he asked.\n“Of course.” Her tone was confident. Her face—what little of it he could\nsee in the shadows—was not.\nHe cleared his throat. “You, uh, sure?” he asked slowly.\nThere was a long silence.

He finally felt her gaze turn on him and heard\nthe soft tremble of a sigh. “Just remembering,” she said with a shake of her\nhead. “It’s been a few years since I’ve had to deal with an assassination\nattempt. You never really get used to them.”\n“That’s right. You’ve dealt with this sort of thing before?”\n“You haven’t?”\n“Been woken up by an assailant? Once. It wasn’t pleasant, and I’ve slept\nlightly ever since.”\nIchtracia remained quiet for several more minutes. He could sense her\nreluctance to speak, and was surprised when she finally did. “I barely slept\nbetween the ages of eight and thirteen. I was so scared of them coming back\nto kill me. Then I started taking mala.”\nMichel had always assumed that she took the mala to deal with her\ncontentious relationship with her grandfather. It had never occurred to him\nthat it was for a far more practical—and personal—reason. He let out a soft\nah and put an arm around her shoulder. She leaned into him, her head\nresting on his shoulder.\n“How do you switch sides so easily?” she asked.\n“Well, it’s not actually easy.”\n“It looks easy for you.” She paused. “Dahre and his people. They all\nseem so… decent. Average. Just normal people living their lives. I’ve been\nwith them for just a couple of days and I’ve stayed aloof, but I find myself\nwondering more about them—their home lives, their loves and hates, their\ninner thoughts. I wonder where they’ll be next year or in a decade.”\n“That’s called empathy,” Michel said, trying not to sound\ncondescending. “It’s an important tool for a spy.”\n“So you’ve told me. But the deeper I get into these people, the more I\ncare about them.”\nMichel didn’t reply. It was something he struggled with for every person\nhe had to deceive. He’d felt it so strongly just the other night when he saw\nTenik again. “It’s hard,” he whispered.\n“I never imagined.” Ichtracia’s voice trembled. “I think… I think I’m\nbeginning to see why you do it.”\n“Oh?”\n“We’re deceiving them, but we’re also down here among them. The\nPalo, that is. I’m beginning to feel the bottled-up anger. The way that you\neat and breathe the oppression by stronger people. I can see it in everyone’s\neyes. Even the well-to-do have it—like Dahre. There’s a little pain that’s in\nthe eyes of all the Palo that isn’t there for the Kressians or Dynize. It’s…”\nShe trailed off for a moment, then continued thoughtfully, “It’s like I’ve\nfound an entire people who know what it’s like to live beneath my\ngrandfather. It’s terrifying but… wonderful at the same time. Does that\nmake sense?”\n“Misery loves company?”\nShe laughed softly. “Yes, I suppose it does.”\nMichel was surprised when she suddenly leaned in and kissed him, then\nsettled back against his shoulder to wait. He fell into his own thoughts,\nconsidering her words, turning over what it meant to be of a people but also\nof none. He eventually had to push those thoughts away before they took a\ndark path."

He eventually had to push those thoughts away before they took a\ndark path.\nOver the next few hours, his anxiety began to lessen as no one returned.\nNo assassins. No Dynize. Just no one. Frustrating, but not deadly. He was\njust beginning to think it might be time to abandon their hiding spot and\nmove on to a new safe house when he caught sight of Devin-Mezi\napproaching one of the tenement exits. She paused just outside, beneath a\ngas lantern, looking around furtively. Michel nudged Ichtracia. “Our friend\nis back.”\n“I still think you should have let me kill her.” Ichtracia yawned.\n“We’ll find out if you were right soon enough.”\nDevin-Mezi headed inside. Michel remained rooted to his spot, watching\nfor any sign of hidden companions, until he was satisfied that Devin-Mezi\nhad come alone. He slid back from the ledge. “With me,” he told Ichtracia,\nheading down a narrow staircase and then dropping onto the next level\ndown. A steep ramp led them to the exit, and they arrived at almost the\nsame moment that Devin-Mezi reappeared, her face screwed up in a look of\nfrustration.\n“You’re late,” Michel said.\nDevin-Mezi jumped and whirled, drawing a knife. She eyeballed him for\na moment, then Ichtracia, before putting her knife back. “You said three\nhours.”\n“It’s been three and fifteen.”\n“I had to get Kelinar to a doctor.”\n“Will he be all right?”\n“I have no idea.” Devin-Mezi glared at Ichtracia.\nIchtracia smiled back at her softly. “Careful who you try to knife, next\ntime.”\n“There won’t be a next time,” Michel intervened. “Well. You’re back. I\ntake it you’re here to fetch us to Mama Palo?”\n“I am. I was told to take the Privileged’s gloves, first.”\n“Over my dead body,” Ichtracia snapped.\n“Either I get your gloves, or I don’t take either of you anywhere.”\nDevin-Mezi folded her arms. Michel had to give it to her—she had guts. To\ncome back and say that to a Privileged took both courage and stupidity. Just\nas it would be stupid for Ichtracia to give up her only pair of gloves just\nbefore heading out to meet with strangers. Luckily, Ichtracia had several\npairs hidden about her person. He pretended to hesitate before turning to\nIchtracia. “I’m going to give her your gloves,” he said, swinging the pack\noff his shoulder. He dug inside for a moment before handing them to Devin-\nMezi.\nIchtracia’s lip curled, but she didn’t respond.\n“Good enough?” Michel asked.\nDevin-Mezi held the gloves up to the light suspiciously.\n“Like I said,” he continued, “we’re on the same side. If that doesn’t\nprove it, I don’t know what will.”\n“All right,” Devin-Mezi replied hesitantly. “Follow me.”\nThey were led through the twists and turns of the Depths at an alarming\nrate, heading up, down, across, and under a dozen different levels.

Michel\nstopped trying to keep track of their path and instead watched for\nlandmarks. By the time they reached their destination, he had only a vague\nidea that they were deep in the center of the Depths—very deep, with real\nground beneath their feet.\nThey went through a nondescript white door and were suddenly stopped\nby a pair of heavily armed Palo. Both men wore two pistols and a sword,\nand both took a pistol in hand as the door opened. They relaxed at the sight\nof Devin-Mezi but kept their eyes on Michel and Ichtracia.\n“The visitors that Mama requested,” Devin-Mezi introduced.\nWhether the two had been told what Ichtracia was, or were just naturally\nwary, they fell in behind Michel and Ichtracia without a word. Michel\nreached into his bag and handed them his unloaded pistol. “I’ll want this\nback,” he told them before being herded through another door.\nThey might as well have stepped into a nobleman’s townhouse, so\ndifferent was this next room from the rest of the Depths. It was a wide, open\nroom with immaculate plastering, well-lit by gas lanterns, and genuine art\non the walls. Mattresses covered the floor, each taken over by a sleeping\nform, and Michel was more than a little surprised by the sight of it. This had\nthe feel of one of Taniel’s safe houses, and the extra bodies told him that it\nmight well be Mama Palo’s headquarters.\nThey picked their way through the impromptu bunkhouse and went\ndown a hallway. There was more art on the walls; the plaster and trim were\nall the familiar materials used by the upper crust of Landfall. Michel’s\ncuriosity about the new Mama Palo grew tenfold. Whoever she was, she\nhad good taste.\nDevin-Mezi knocked on a door at the end of the hall. A muffled voice\nanswered, and she opened the door. Michel took a deep breath, shared a\nglance with Ichtracia, and followed Devin-Mezi inside.\nThe room was spacious enough to have once been a drawing room. It\nhad been commandeered as a bedroom and office with a large, four-poster\nbed shoved into one corner and a desk and several tables taking up the rest\nof it. Michel’s impression of a headquarters immediately solidified at the\nsight of all the maps and papers spread across every surface. There were\neven rifle crates piled in one corner, stamped with the Hrusch family logo.\nThe last thing in the room to fall under Michel’s eye was the woman\nsitting behind the desk. Like many Palo, she could be considered petite, just\na shade over five feet tall with waist-length hair combed out over one\nshoulder. She was young, a couple years younger than Michel at best, but\nshe had an aura of command about her, even sitting there in her nightgown\nwith hair down. Her chin was resting on one fist, the other hand holding a\nbook up to the lamplight, and it was only her eyes that moved when the\nsmall group paraded into the room.

Her name was Jiniel, and the moment\nMichel saw her, he had to stifle a grin and a spike of fear all at the same\ntime.\nA normal reaction, he decided, for someone seeing an old lover for the\nfirst time in years.\n“Cousin,” Devin-Mezi said, “this is the guy calling himself Puffer.\nCareful with the woman. I’ve taken her gloves, but she still might be\ndangerous, she—”\n“Out,” Jiniel said.\n“Cousin?”\n“Not you. The other two. No need for guards.”\n“Cousin, are—”\nJiniel snorted loudly, and the sound sent the two guards scurrying. Once\nthe door had shut behind them, Jiniel set down her book and stretched,\nletting out a severe yawn. “The woman’s name is Ichtracia. She’s a Dynize\nbone-eye.” Devin-Mezi swore, and had begun to go for her knife before\nJiniel held up one hand to forestall a fight. “If she’s here with Michel, that’s\nenough for me.”\n“Michel?” Devin-Mezi muttered, turning toward Michel with a look of\nconfusion. Her jaw suddenly dropped. “You’re Michel Bravis?”\nMichel had never heard his name spoken with a tinge of awe before. He\nwasn’t sure where it came from, but he knew within moments that he liked\nit. “That’s me.”\n“I had no idea, I—”\nMichel cut her off gently with a question he’d been wondering since\ntheir first introduction at Meln-Dun’s quarry. “Did you really work for the\nYaret Household?”\n“I did. I was there the same time as you. I only ever saw you once, but\nyou look nothing—”\n“Michel,” Jiniel interjected, “is our best spy. I’d be shocked if he still\nlooked anything like he did a month ago. He certainly looks nothing like he\ndid three years ago. How are you, Michel? It’s been too long.” There was a\nnote of exhaustion to Jiniel’s voice that elicited a bit of worry in the back of\nMichel’s mind. He was not, truth be told, all that surprised to find her here\nas Mama Palo. Despite her age, she was one of the cleverest people he’d\never met. Add in a great deal of intelligence and charisma, and she was a\nnatural successor for Ka-poel’s authority in Landfall. But in the time he’d\nknown her, she’d always had the most boundless energy. To hear such\nweariness seeping into her voice was not good.\n“It has,” he agreed, waving his three-fingered hand at her to answer her\nquestion. “Sorry for coming in like this. Your cousin here tried to knife me\nearlier tonight.”\n“So I heard.” Jiniel leaned forward, resting her elbows on her desk and\nnestling her chin behind her hands. She looked hard at Michel, then at\nIchtracia. “I’m sorry about that. We had no idea it was you—just some\nasshole mercenary here to ruin our plans.”"

We had no idea it was you—just some\nasshole mercenary here to ruin our plans.”\n“That’s fine. I didn’t know you had a cousin. Or that you were the new\nMama Palo. I forgot to ask Taniel the last time I saw him.”\n“I’m sure he had other things on his mind.”\n“He definitely did,” Michel agreed. He noted that Jiniel’s gaze was still\non Ichtracia and glanced over his shoulder to find her hanging back near the\ndoor, hands thrust in her pockets. She hadn’t said a word in the brief time\nsince they entered, and the look of appraisal on her face said that she was\nsizing up Jiniel the same as Jiniel was doing to her. She shot Michel a quick\nglance full of a thousand questions. They’d have to be answered later, he\ndecided. For now, he needed to explain her presence. There was an awful\nlot to go through, and he wasn’t sure whom to trust and how much to trust\nthem.\n“Why do you have a Privileged with you?” Jiniel finally asked.\nA moment’s consideration passed before he decided to tell Jiniel. He\ndidn’t have much choice. But that didn’t mean he had to spread it around.\nHe gave Devin-Mezi a significant look, and Jiniel spoke up immediately.\n“Give us some privacy, Cousin.”\nDevin-Mezi hesitated only a moment before showing herself out. Once\nshe was gone, Michel let out a breath he didn’t even know he’d been\nholding in. “You don’t trust her?”\n“I do,” Jiniel answered. “But the less she knows, the better.”\n“Compartmentalization,” Ichtracia said.\n“Exactly. I see that Michel has started training you how to think like\nhim.”\n“It’s an… education,” Ichtracia replied.\n“It is. He trained me, too. Michel, are you going to tell me why the\ngranddaughter of the Great Ka is running with you?”\nMichel sucked on his teeth. “She’s Ka-poel’s sister.”\nHe couldn’t think of a time in the past that he’d seen Jiniel genuinely\nsurprised, so the look on her face now was one that he cast to memory to\nenjoy for the rest of his life. He let the statement sit for a moment, then\nleapt into a very brief explanation of their adventures over the last few\nmonths. Jiniel remained silent throughout the whole thing, her fingers\nsteepled in front of her face. Once Michel had finished, with a few\ninterjections from Ichtracia, Jiniel opened a desk drawer, removed three\nglasses, and poured a finger of Palo whiskey into each. Michel took two\nglasses, handing one to Ichtracia. They all downed the unspoken toast in\nsilence.\nJiniel chuckled and ran a hand over her face. “I thought I had had a pit\nof a year. But you… by Kresimir, that is some story.”\nMichel rubbed the stubs of his missing fingers gingerly. “When I say it\nall at once, it certainly is.” He looked back at Ichtracia again. This was not"

This was not\nthe first time he’d been in the room with an ex-lover and a current lover at\nthe same time, but that didn’t make it any less uncomfortable. He was\nwilling to bet that both women had already sussed out that much about the\nother—Jiniel spoke to him too warmly; Ichtracia hovered too close.\nNothing was said, of course, but the very energy in the air put him on edge.\n“These sacrifices,” Jiniel said, pouring them each another round.\n“You’re certain about them?”\nIt was the one part of Michel’s story that had gotten a deep frown from\nJiniel, and he was not surprised to hear her come back to it so quickly.\n“That’s the problem. I have the word of a Blackhat, and Ichtracia’s own\ncertainty.”\n“But no evidence.”\n“No evidence.”\nJiniel sighed heavily. “I haven’t heard anything. Disappearances, yes.\nBut those happen in times of war and chaos. People die, drift away, or are\nnabbed by enemy agents.”\n“These would be… a few thousand disappearances in total since the\ninvasion.”\n“That’s not very many people in a city this big,” Jiniel said. “I’m sorry.\nNothing has snagged our notice.”\n“I need to find out,” Michel said, “and if it is true, the word needs to be\nspread.”\n“Of course! But I barely have enough resources to keep our organization\ngoing. We’ve been running from Meln-Dun’s men, attempting to sift\nthrough Dynize propaganda to find out how they really intend to treat us,\nand dogging what few Blackhats were left after that purge you conducted\nthrough the Dynize.” Jiniel paused, her face scrunched up in a scowl. “What\nyou’re saying is such an outlandish story that we need some kind of\nevidence to move forward on it.”\n“And what can you do if we can find evidence?” Ichtracia spoke up. She\nmoved to sit on the corner of Jiniel’s desk, crossing her arms and looking\ndown at Jiniel as if daring her to comment on it.\n“Fight back.” There was a note of helplessness in her voice. “Do what\nwe can.”\n“I have a plan for that,” Michel said, “but I’ll need your resources.”\n“Then give me something to work with.”\nProof of Sedial sacrificing citizens in a blood rite of some kind. When\nMichel crammed the thought into so few words, it sounded simple. But if\nno one had noticed anything wrong yet? Maybe he was chasing a breeze,\nand the ghost of je Tura was laughing at him from the afterlife. He tapped\nhis chin. Not no one. No one important. He needed to find the unimportant\npeople who might have noticed. “I’ll come up with proof. For now, I need\nyou to call off this trap you’re preparing for Meln-Dun’s men.”\n“Call it off?” Jiniel scoffed. “It’s happening tonight—and it’s not just a\nlittle trap. We’re going to ambush his goons at the same time we send a\nstrike team into the quarry.”"

We’re going to ambush his goons at the same time we send a\nstrike team into the quarry.”\nMichel inhaled sharply. “You’re planning on assassinating him?”\nJiniel nodded.\n“Don’t.”\n“The plan is in place.”\n“You have to scrap it.” Michel paused, considering. “Wait. No, don’t\nscrap it. But I think I can make it unnecessary.”\n“What are you planning?” Jiniel asked cautiously.\n“Something that will eliminate Meln-Dun’s threat to us without having\nto kill fellow Palo and without bringing the Dynize down on our heads.”\n“I’m listening.”\nMichel gave her a tight smile. “Compartmentalization.”\n“I forgot how much I hate it when you use that word,” Jiniel said.\n“Right?” Ichtracia added.\n“Okay, Michel,” Jiniel continued after a moment of thought. “If you can\nmake my attack unnecessary, well… I’ll be damned impressed.”\n“I’ll do it,” Michel promised. “Give me twelve hours.”\nCHAPTER 27\nS\ntyke swam until he could feel his strength beginning to wane, and then\npulled Orz down one of the countless tiny canals of Talunlica. It was a\nwaxing crescent moon that shone a pale light across the city, giving him just\nenough light to navigate by and—he hoped—just enough darkness to hide\nwithin. He found a tiny inlet, shallow enough for him to touch his toes to\nthe bottom, and broke a bit of reed weaving off one of the floating gardens\nto hook underneath Orz’s arm. He put his own shoulder beneath Orz’s other\narm and lowered himself into the water so that everything below his nose\nwas covered.\nOccasionally he could hear distant shouting. There were a few splashes\nearly on, and torchlight in the distance, but the Dynize did not seem readily\nequipped to organize a search. Styke mulled over his options. The\ndragonman had survived their conflict, which meant that he had seen\nStyke’s face. He would know to look for an immense foreigner. Once he\nhad a little bit of time to gather more searchers and widen the net, he might\nfind Styke hiding in the water—or even discover Styke’s men at the inn.\nStyke vacillated between abandoning Orz in an attempt to reach his men\nand get them out of the city, and remaining with the dragonman. His\nthinking drifted slowly toward the former option. Orz was as good as dead,\nbone-eye sorcery or not, and even if he could survive, he was just\ndeadweight.\nHe paused midthought as he felt Orz’s body shift. Lifting them both a\nlittle out of the water, Styke pressed his ear up against Orz’s mouth. “You\nstill breathing, you tattooed asshole?” Styke whispered. For a few moments\nhe thought that Orz had finally given up the ghost, but to his surprise the\ndragonman took a sudden deep breath.\n“Bolts… have to get… out.”\n“Those bolts are the only thing keeping you from bleeding out right\nnow,” Styke told him. “I can’t speak for the infection this damned lake"

He closed his eyes and saw, once again, the old\nwoman’s body being torn apart by crossbow bolts. He remembered the\nlantern she had hung in the window—a signal, probably. He also\nremembered, very distinctly, that she’d sent Orz out for water right before\nthe ambush. Styke wondered if she’d had a change of heart at that last\nmoment. They’d never know. Not that it mattered.\nOrz’s breath began to come a little stronger, ragged and loud. Styke\ncraned his head to try to get a good look at the nearby street. They were just\noff one of the countless little dead-end streets much like the one they’d\nescaped. Farther down the canal someone was smoking in the evening air,\nfacing the opposite direction, but otherwise the area was abandoned and the\noccupants asleep. “Should I be worried about swamp dragons, or do they\nstay out of the lake?” he whispered to Orz.\nThere was no answer.\n“Shit.” Styke craned his head again, this time trying to pierce the\ndarkness and get a good look at the silhouette of the surrounding mountains.\nIt wasn’t an accurate way to get his bearings, but it would be a start. He\nlifted Orz’s arm and hooked the dragonman’s limp fingers around the reeds\nof the floating garden, then swam out a couple of feet to get a better look. It\ntook a few minutes, but he was eventually able to spot the black shadow of\nthe godstone stabbing into the sky—probably a quarter of a mile to his\nnorthwest.\nHe had just one option: Get Orz to Ka-poel. She might be able to\nstrengthen the blood sorcery that had kept him alive this long. But to do so,\nhe’d need to risk the avenues, where frequent city guard patrols would spot\nhim within minutes. He considered swimming, or a boat. Both avenues\nwere more than likely to get him lost and confused.\nHe swam back to Orz. “You have any suggestions on how to get out of\nthis?”\nOrz took a ragged breath but did not answer.\nStyke eyeballed a canoe tied up behind one of the nearby houses.\nPerhaps there was another option. He disentangled Orz from the reeds and\nset off across the canal with the dragonman in tow. Reaching the opposite\nbank, he found a couple of brick steps just above the waterline and\nleveraged himself, then Orz, onto dry land—careful to move slowly to\nmake the least amount of noise.\n“Sorry,” he whispered to Orz, then dumped him off the land and into the\nbottom of the canoe. There was a loud thunk, and he grimaced into the\ndarkness, waiting for a face to appear in a window, or a door to open.\nMinutes passed. No one came to investigate the noise.\nStyke found a paddle and untied the canoe before lowering himself in.\nUsing deep, slow strokes, he pushed off and began to head down the middle\nof the canal."

There\nwasn’t a lot to go on—his earlier view from above the city, then their walk\nto the palace complex, and finally the trip to Orz’s mother’s house. But it\nwould have to be enough, he decided. He certainly wasn’t going far.\nOnce he was moving, he rooted around in the bottom of the canoe,\nfinding an old wool blanket tucked under the stern. It reeked of fish, but he\ntossed it over his head as a hood and continued to paddle.\nPulling out into open water gave him a better chance to orient himself.\nHe’d managed to make quite some distance in his panicked swim. There\nwas a wide channel, at least half of a mile between his current location and\nwhere he believed was the site of the ambush. The houses over there were\nlit, the streets filled with moving lanterns. There were a couple of boats in\nthe water, but they hugged the shore as if the searchers had not expected\nhim to get far with a body in tow.\nAfter getting his bearings he decided to cling to the bank, keeping a\nwary eye on the distant searchers. His progress was slow but fairly quiet,\nand the occasional soul that he passed in the night gave him little more than\na friendly wave. He returned those waves and continued on.\nAs he’d decided earlier, heading back to the inn would be too risky by\nwater. He didn’t know the canal routes at all, and getting lost would put him\nat great risk.\nHe did, however, have a pretty good idea where to find the Minister of\nDrainage.\nHe rounded several small islands and suburban promontories, leaving\nthe lamps of the searchers behind him, before spotting a watchtower ahead\nin the darkness. It was—he hoped—the same watchtower that marked the\nEtzi Household. Eventually the complex defined itself in the gloom: a large,\nwalled villa at the end of a man-made cape. It looked to be about the size of\na small village, with dozens of buildings rising above the short walls. Easily\nbig enough to house a small army or, as Orz had put it, a minor Household.\nBy the time Styke reached the villa complex, he was exhausted. His\narms and shoulders ached, his eyes hurt from trying to peer into the gloom.\nHe pulled up alongside the single cobbled road that led to the villa and\nrolled onto the land. After a few moments of rest, he reached back into the\ncanoe to fetch Orz.\nMiraculously, the dragonman was still alive, letting out a loud groan\nwhen Styke lifted him.\nStyke had thought to drop Orz on his brother’s doorstep and make his\nescape. But the noise brought an answering sound from within the walls,\nand within a few moments there were a handful of clacks and a low squeal\nas one of the big, iron-strapped doors of the complex opened. An old man\nwith a gray mustache held a lantern high on the end of a pole, thrusting it\ntoward Styke.\n“What’s this here?” he demanded in a low voice."

He considered making for the canoe, but\nthe idea of trying to flee yet another scene did not sit well with him. He’d\nmade his decision. It was time to throw himself on the mercy of others. And\nif that failed, he’d go for his knife.\nThe man took another step closer. “I asked you a question! Is that a\nbody?”\nStyke answered in broken Dynize, filling in any words he wasn’t certain\nof with their Palo counterparts. “I’m looking for Meln-Etzi. Is this his\nhome?”\nThe old man took a half step back, calling something over his shoulder\ninto the door behind him. “Yes, this is the Etzi Household.” Then he\nscurried forward, lowering the lantern to play on Orz’s face. He let out a\ngasp. “Go fetch the master,” he barked to a young girl who had appeared in\nthe doorway. He lifted his lantern, peering at Styke. This time he actually\nfled back to the door, standing with one hand on the wood as if to slam it\nshut in Styke’s face if he made a move.\n“I’m his slave,” Styke attempted.\nThe old watchman didn’t answer. A few minutes passed and some small\ncommotion took him inside, only for him to reappear a moment later.\nStyke had expected to find Orz’s brother to be older, but he was\nsurprised at the appearance of a bespectacled man in his midthirties who\nwore a hastily thrown-on robe over silk pajamas. Like Orz’s mother, the\nresemblance was uncanny. But while Orz had hard, unbending features, this\nman seemed soft and thoughtful. He paused in the doorway, his watchman\npeering over his shoulder as if his master would protect him from this\nhulking foreigner.\n“Who are you?” Etzi demanded.\nStyke bit his tongue, remembering Celine’s lecture, and bowed his head\nrespectfully. “I am Orz’s slave.”\nA grunt answered. “Do you know who I am?”\n“His brother.”\nEtzi took the lantern from his watchman and thrust it in Styke’s face for\na handful of moments, then gave another grunt and knelt beside Orz. He\ntook a deep breath, looking him up and down, then pointed at Styke. “You,\ncarry him inside. You.” His finger twitched to his watchman. “Fetch Maetle.\nBe quick about it and don’t wake anyone else up.”\nStyke obeyed, lifting Orz with both arms—in a manner somewhat\ngentler than he’d been treating him so far—and followed Etzi through the\ndoor. They didn’t have far to go, ducking through a darkened servant’s\nentrance just inside the compound walls and emerging into a long kitchen\nwith high ceilings, the likes of which would have been recognizable in any\nlordling or merchant’s manner hall. Etzi gestured for Styke to set Orz on\none of the long preparation tables and then walked briskly around the\nkitchen, shuttering windows, before turning up the lamps."

Styke was glad for the\nsilence—questions would start soon, and he’d never been a very good liar.\nThe longer he had to think of some story, the better.\nThe watchman soon returned, followed by a woman in her midtwenties.\nTo Styke’s surprise, she was not Dynize—or at least, not a full-blood\nDynize. She had dark brown hair and only a hint of freckles on her cheeks\nand arms. She carried a satchel over one shoulder and wore a nightgown,\nstill rubbing the sleep out of her eyes as she entered the room.\nShe froze at the sight of Orz, letting out a tiny gasp before rushing to his\nside and, in the process, shouldering Styke aside. He relinquished his spot\nto stand in the corner of the kitchen, where he could watch all three\nentrances as well as the figures swarming around Orz’s body. He casually\nrested his hand on the hilt of his knife.\nEtzi had called for Maetle, and Styke could only assume this was she.\nHe couldn’t smell any sorcery on her, but he’d seen a lot of surgeons in his\nday and she had the air. As if to confirm his suspicions, she disgorged her\nsatchel onto the table beside Orz’s head, revealing bottles, bandages, tiny\nsacks, and a full complement of small blades, tweezers, saws, and tools that\nStyke didn’t even recognize. Her equipment was tidily organized,\neverything labeled, and she quickly arranged a handful of items close at\nhand and pushed the rest away.\n“Well?” Etzi asked.\nMaetle paused with her hands hovering over Orz’s chest. Styke could\nstill see a slight rise and fall. Maetle responded to her master in Dynize,\nspeaking so quickly that it was hard for Styke to follow. “He’s still alive.”\n“I know that!”\n“And he may yet live. I can’t be certain.” She hesitated. “I’ve read about\nthis sort of thing, but I’ve never dealt with it myself.”\n“A pincushioned fool?” Etzi asked.\n“No,” Maetle shot back. “Dragonmen and the bone-eye sorcery that\nmakes them…” She cleared her throat and continued in a gentler tone.\n“Sorry, master. The bone-eye sorcery that makes them strong. Supposedly it\ncan help them survive wounds beyond anything a normal person could\nweather. This… he should have bled out… you, how long has he been like\nthis?”\nStyke’s head jerked up. He realized he’d been starting to nod off even\nwhile listening. “A couple of hours.”\nMaetle gave him a peculiar look. “What did you say?”\n“I said…” He realized he’d answered in Adran.

Bled out.\nBut dragonmen can go into a sorcery-induced trance that slows their heart\nand the bleeding.”\n“But you don’t know if he’ll survive?” Etzi asked.\n“I don’t. But I need to remove the bolts, clean the wounds, and find out\nif they punctured anything vital. Shall I begin?”\nEtzi rubbed his chin, staring down at his brother’s body. The silence\ndragged on. A minute. Then two. Styke felt as if he could see Orz’s breaths\ngrowing slower. Finally, none of Celine’s lecture about remaining meek\ncould keep him from losing his patience. “Well, are you going to save\nhim?” he demanded.\nAll three of them looked up sharply. The watchman raced across the\nroom and smacked Styke hard across the face. The sharpness of the blow\nseemed to shake off some of his exhaustion, and he set his teeth. The\nwatchman drew back his hand. “You do not speak to the master of the house\nin such a manner! You are a slave, you…” He swung again, and Styke\ncaught him by the wrist before the blow could fall. The old man seemed\nconfused, then immediately began to struggle against Styke’s grip.\n“Let him go,” Etzi ordered.\nStyke ground his teeth. “Are you going to save your brother or not?”\n“Let him go,” Etzi repeated. Styke knew the tone well, no matter the\nlanguage it was spoken in. He’d heard it as a young man in the military, and\nhe’d heard it every day for ten years in the labor camps. It took a supreme\nact of willpower not to snap the watchman’s wrist. Finally, he released the\nman.\nThe watchman stumbled back, wringing his hands. “What kind of a\nslave—”\n“That,” Etzi cut him off, “is not a slave. What is your name, foreigner?”\nStyke bit down hard on his tongue. He’d only ever been good at ending\nconfrontations with violence. It would not work this time—at least, it\nwouldn’t work in his favor. “Ben,” he answered.\n“This man,” Etzi gestured at Orz, “is already dead. He died when he spit\nat the emperor’s feet. He was imprisoned and declared an un-person. Now\nhe is here, as if having clawed his way out of a grave.” He used a word next\nthat sounded fairly close to an old Palo legend of the undead. “My duty\nwould be that of any man confronted with a zombie: to call the authorities\nto destroy it. Tell me, Ben, what would you do in my place?”\nStyke sniffed. “Metaphor means nothing in the face of the truth,” he said\nin Adran, trying to think of the right words in Dynize.\n“Metaphor is all I have,” Etzi replied, also in Adran.\nIt was not the first time Styke had been surprised to hear a Dynize speak\npassable Adran.

Someone slips into a coma, or comes\ndown with a disease of the heart that makes them sleep as if dead. I’ve\nheard one story of a woman digging herself out of her own grave. Other\nstories tell of strange sounds at night in the graveyard and when the body is\ndug up, there are claw marks on the inside of the coffin.”\n“What is your point?”\n“My point is that sometimes you think someone is dead. But they’re not.\nAll that matters now is what’s in front of you.”\nThe watchman had retreated to the door that led back out into the\ncourtyard, as if waiting for permission to run for the city guard. Maetle\nremained by Orz, one hand resting gently on his chest, eyes glued to Styke.\nEtzi stared into the middle distance between Orz and Styke, forehead still\nfurrowed, spectacles perched on the tip of his nose.\n“You called for a surgeon,” Styke said. “You wouldn’t have done that if\nyou didn’t care.”\nThe tension was suddenly broken by a hammering on the front gate of\nthe complex, followed by a call for the watchman. Everyone in the room\nlooked to Etzi, who himself glanced toward the source of the sound in\nannoyance.\nThe hammering continued.\n“It’s the city guard, master,” the watchman said in a low voice, casting\nmeaningful glances at Orz’s body. “They can deal with this.”\nStyke found his hand gripping the hilt of his knife, his stomach wrapped\nin knots. This was it. How he’d die. In a stranger’s home in a strange land,\nfailing the men he’d left back at the inn to get drunk. The authorities would\nclean this up in a few days. No one back home would ever know what had\nhappened. No glory. No memories. Just the disappearance of Mad Ben\nStyke and the Mad Lancers.\n“Answer them,” Etzi said sharply. “Say nothing of this. Leave them\noutside and then go to my rooms to fetch me.”\n“Master?”\n“Go! Maetle, turn off those lanterns. Ben, lift my brother.” The orders\nwere barked in a low tone, decisive and quick. Etzi ducked under one of the\npreparation tables and came back up with a handful of flour. Styke had no\nsooner lurched forward and lifted Orz than the flour was tossed across the\ntable. Etzi snatched up a flat blade and scraped the mess—including water\nand blood from Orz—onto the floor, then threw down more flour. At a\ncasual glance it looked like little more than a common kitchen mess.\n“With me,” Etzi said, striding to the corner of the room. He opened a\ndoor to a spacious pantry and quickly shuffled several crates, then reached\ndown and slid his finger into a ring. Lifting it revealed a dark, narrow hole.\n“Old smuggling cache,” he explained quickly. “You’ll have to drop him in\nthere and follow him down before he swallows too much water.”"

There was no adrenaline\nto fuel him into the water now, and he blanched. He could feel the silliness\nof it even as the fear swept through him. “I won’t even fit.”\n“You either go down there or you start by killing me and then however\nmany city guard you can manage until they put you down. It’s your choice.\nThe knife or the hatch.”\nStyke was taken aback. Etzi had no fear in his eyes, just businesslike\nexpectation. It was a strange thing to loom over such a bookish person\nwithout eliciting the tiniest bit of worry. He gave a growl and shifted Orz\nfrom two arms to one, slipping his hands under his shoulders and lowering\nhim, feetfirst, down the hatch. He got down as far as he could before\ndropping Orz, his body slipping into the water. Styke followed, forcing his\nshoulders diagonally through the narrow space. As soon as his head was\nbelow the floor, the hatch was closed and he could hear things being moved\nback on top of it.\nHe was in complete darkness, his feet touching slick stone about five\nfeet below the waterline. He lifted Orz with one arm and reached cautiously\nwith the other, getting a feel for the area. It appeared to be an open rectangle\n—just enough room for a rowboat to come and go, probably pushed in by\nsomeone in the water until it was directly below the hatch and then\nunloaded. There was a thick layer of slime on everything, including the iron\nrungs of the ladder, indicating it hadn’t been used in quite some time.\nStyke tilted his head, listening carefully to the muffled voices out in the\ncourtyard.\n“Foreigner… dragonman… betrayal… searching…” He only picked up\nbits and pieces, but it became quickly apparent that they were searching for\nhim. Protestations from Etzi. Questions. Demands. Voices raised. Then the\nsound of feet on the kitchen floor. At least a half-dozen pairs. Styke gently\npushed himself away from the ladder in case the hatch was opened.\nDoors were slammed. “Search here,” he heard someone say from the\nkitchen. There was the shuffling of pots and pans, the sliding of drawers\nand the creaking of cupboard hinges.\n“If you’re going to empty that, you should put it back,” Etzi said in a\nperturbed tone. “Oh, for the love of the emperor. Do you think I’ve hidden a\ngiant and a dead man in the silverware drawer? You, hang that back where\nyou found it!”\nThe door to the pantry opened. A sliver of light cut down through the\nfloorboards into Styke’s hiding spot. He drew his knife slowly, so as not to\nmake a sound in the water. Someone kicked over a crate. The door shut\nagain.

Styke put his knife back and\npushed himself up against the slimy stone wall of the smuggler’s nook,\nlistening to the distant sounds of rooms being ransacked.\nTime crept by and Styke summoned his last reserves of strength just to\nhold Orz’s head above the water. He had no idea how long he’d been there,\nor how long it had been since he’d heard the noise of searchers. He was just\nbeginning to think it was over when the kitchen door opened again and he\nheard two distinct sets of footsteps crossing the floor, accompanied by two\nvoices.\nOne was Etzi, speaking in a tired, conversational tone: “… happy to\nserve the emperor in any way possible, but if you could avoid waking up\nmy entire Household next time, I’d be most grateful.”\n“I’ll do what needs to be done,” the second voice answered in a harsh,\nclipped tone. Styke recognized it. It belonged to the dragonman who had\nambushed them at Orz’s mother’s house. He realized that one of the sets of\nfootsteps had a distinct limp, and it brought a smile to his face. The smile\nquickly disappeared when he realized that the dragonman must not have\nadmitted his role in the murder of Etzi’s mother.\n“And I’ll lodge a complaint to the emperor if this happens again,” Etzi\nresponded. “You know, I have a very talented surgeon on staff if you’d like\nsomeone to look at that leg.” The door from the kitchen to the courtyard\nopened and the voices grew too muffled to understand.\nOver an hour must have passed before there was a flurry of footsteps,\nthe scraping of crates, and then the hatch above Styke opened. He was\nmomentarily blinded by a lantern being lowered down, then looked up to\nsee the faces of Etzi, Maetle, and the watchman. Etzi seemed irritated.\nMaetle concerned. The watchman resigned. “Come on,” Etzi said in Adran.\n“Hand him up to us. I hope he’s still breathing.”\nStyke squeezed himself out of the hatch after Orz had been hauled up,\nthen stood dripping water on the floor while the three Dynize conferred\namong themselves. The watchman was sent away, then Etzi turned to Styke.\nHis face was thoughtful, and he looked at Styke with a considering eye.\n“The dragonman. You gave him the limp?”\nStyke shrugged. He didn’t have energy for anything else.\n“He claimed Orz had given him the limp and killed his men. But they\nwouldn’t have been able to stick Orz with so many bolts without an\nambush, and he clearly wouldn’t be fighting after that. So it must have been\nyou. Well, I’m glad my brother has been keeping good company. Come,\ncarry him to Maetle’s room. You can rest there.”\n“And Orz?” Styke asked.\n“You need to keep quiet and hidden. I don’t trust the emperor enough to\nnot have spies in my Household. Maetle will do what she can. It’ll be a\nmiracle if he’s still alive in the morning.”\nCHAPTER 28\nS"

        "text": "not have spies in my Household. Maetle will do what she can. It’ll be a\nmiracle if he’s still alive in the morning.”\nCHAPTER 28\nS\ntyke rolled off his uncomfortable reed mat and sat up, hitting his head\nhard on a piece of furniture. He rubbed furiously at his forehead, taking a\nfew moments to orient himself in the darkness before remembering that he\nwas in Maetle’s office, sleeping underneath her desk. He craned his neck\nand crawled out from underneath it, climbing slowly to his feet. He guessed\nit was around five o’clock in the morning.\nThe Etzi Household surgeon had her own quarters in the western corner\nof the compound. It wasn’t large—a bedroom, office, and infirmary—but it\nwas sequestered away from the rest of the sleeping areas. The last thing\nStyke remembered was laying Orz on the infirmary bed and collapsing onto\nthe reed mat while Maetle began work on the dragonman. He stepped\nacross the room, poking his head into the bedroom and listening to a\nwoman’s soft snores, before stepping into the infirmary.\nOrz was still there. His clothes had been cut away and his chest wrapped\nin bandages. Styke had to lower his cheek to Orz’s mouth to feel the\nslightest of shallow breaths. He wondered if Ka-poel’s sorcery would allow\nhim to survive such a mauling and if perhaps he’d been too hasty in\nrejecting it.\nToo late now. He needed to move—to get out of here before sunrise and\nget back to the inn. The city guard would be searching for unfamiliar\nforeigners. Styke needed to get his men out of the city as quickly as\npossible. Their best chance would be to ride south as hard as they could,\nposing Ka-poel as their local master and not stopping to answer questions.\nThey should be within twenty or thirty miles of the rendezvous. They could\nmake that in two days if they were quick about it.\nHe wondered if the landing had ever happened, if he was riding his\ntwenty Lancers toward an empty jungle with Dynize soldiers on their tail. It\nwas too late to hesitate at this point. The only way out was forward. Even if\nit got him, and everyone who depended on him, killed. He swore several\ntimes under his breath and gathered his clothes from the back of Maetle’s\noffice chair. They were still damp, but they’d have to do. He began to dress.\n“Ben?”\nHe jerked around to find Maetle sitting up in bed. He quickly began to\npull his boots on. Maetle was up in a flash, lighting a lamp beside her bed\nand hurrying out to him. “What are you doing?” she demanded.\nStyke was too tired to answer immediately, fumbling for the words in\nDynize. “I have to leave.”\n“You can’t.”\n“I have to.” He finished tying his boots and took a step toward the door.\nMaetle darted around him and threw herself against the door, arms spread.\n“You can’t leave,” she said firmly.\nStyke sucked in an angry breath. He didn’t have time for a girl a third\nhis size to tell him what to do. He reached for her shoulder, intent on\nmoving her as gently as he could manage.\n“You touch me and I’ll scream.”"

He reached for her shoulder, intent on\nmoving her as gently as he could manage.\n“You touch me and I’ll scream.”\n“What is wrong with you?” he growled. “I have to go. People are\ndepending on me.”\n“People are depending on you not to leave!”\nStyke scowled at her. “I don’t know what that means.”\n“It means that Master Etzi has put this entire Household at risk for you.\nIf you’re spotted outside the compound, you will be taken, and they’ll\nquestion you, and they’ll find out that he is hiding a fugitive.”\n“Then I won’t be spotted,” Styke said, reaching for her again. Her\ndetermined glare made him drop his hand.\n“You’re hard to miss.”\n“And if you scream, everyone in the compound will know I’m here.”\n“Better to keep it within the compound than for the city guard to find\nyou.”\n“Shit,” he growled. He was feeling desperate, now. The damned Dynize\ncould be coming for his men anytime. He needed to be there for them. He\ntapped one finger against his ring and stared at the door. “I have to go,” he\nsaid quietly. “You don’t want to stand in my way.”\nMaetle thrust one finger up between them. “Wait. Hold on.” Styke rolled\nhis eyes. He’d humor her for exactly ten more seconds, and then he had to\nmove. She rushed to the corner of her infirmary, rooting around in a cabinet\nbefore returning to the door. “Here,” she said, lifting something to his face.\n“Smell this.”\nStyke couldn’t help but take a deep whiff. He jerked back involuntarily\nfrom the slightly sweet, chemical smell. It filled his nostrils, his mouth, and\nhis lungs in the course of a few moments. He took a step back, then another,\nhis feet feeling heavy. “God damn it,” he slurred. “I can’t believe I fell for\nthat.” His vision grew dim and he began to fall.\nWhen Styke awoke, he was lying on his back on the floor with daylight\nstreaming in through the high windows of the infirmary. His vision swam\nfor the first few minutes of consciousness, and it took him some time after\nthat before remembering how he had ended up in this position. The thought\nmade his aching head pound even harder, and he had to force his temper\ndown to acquire any clarity of thought.\n“The effects shouldn’t last long. A couple hours at most.”\nStyke’s body still felt as heavy as a rock, so he tilted his head toward the\nsource of the voice. It was Maetle, sitting on the end of her bed, gazing at\nhim with trepidation.\n“Why does my mouth taste like shit?” Styke asked.\n“I had to dose you directly,” Maetle said. “A couple of drops between\nyour lips to make sure you’d stay down. I gave you enough to knock out a\nhorse, so don’t expect to be able to move for at least thirty minutes.”\nOut of curiosity—and no small amount of spite—Styke flexed his\nfingers.

He felt one arm twitch, then the other, and soon his body seemed to\nbe obeying his commands—albeit with the speed of molasses. He let out a\ngroan and rolled over and up into a sitting position.\n“By the emperor,” Maetle swore.\nIt was a small thing, but it made Styke grin. He didn’t need Ka-poel and\nher sorcery. He was still Ben Styke. The grin faltered at the brass band that\nbegan playing in the back of his head. A spike of worry shot through him as\nhe considered Celine, Ka-poel, and his Lancers. They might still be waiting\nfor him—they may have even been captured. “Pit, this hurts. What time is\nit?”\n“About two in the afternoon.”\nStyke tried to root around for some anger toward this diminutive\nwoman. It was there, certainly, but he couldn’t quite grasp it. He\nremembered their argument clearly. She’d done what she felt was necessary\nto protect her home. It just might have gotten all of Styke’s men killed at\nthe same time. He looked across at her, trying to put himself in her place\nand realizing that she knew absolutely nothing about him—why he was\nhere, who he was—she just knew that he was a foreign giant who’d brought\nher a dying man.\nHe wondered what Etzi knew or suspected, and how much he should be\nready to share. As far as he knew, he was trapped in this room until at least\nsundown. “Where’s your master?” he asked.\n“He went to the games.”\n“The games?” Styke echoed.\n“It is a forum. An area where the powerful gather to gossip and craft\ndeals.”\n“Ah. I can barely…” He had to substitute Palo words and hope they\nwere close. “I can barely think in Adran right now. Do you speak any\nKressian languages?”\nMaetle’s face lit up. “I do,” she said in Kez. “It’s a family language\ngoing back several generations. Do you understand me?”\n“Your accent is very strange,” Styke answered in kind, “but yes, I can\nunderstand you. So you’re Kez?”\n“Half Kez, half Dynize,” she responded, lifting her legs to fold them\nbeneath her on her bed. “My family were traders who remained in Dynize\nwhen the borders closed.”\n“So you’re slaves?”\nHer eyebrows went up. “My family? No, no. Free foreigners, they call\nus. Established. Looked down upon, but tolerated.” She frowned. “If you’re\nnot a slave, how did you come to be in Dynize?”\n“Do you know what’s going on in Fatrasta?” Styke asked.\n“We’re fighting for our land. For the godstone.”\n“You’re fighting for my land,” he countered. “I met Orz there. We came\nhere.” He shrugged, unwilling to tell her more than that.\nMaetle didn’t seem all that bothered by talk of the war.

He’d seen the same distant, casual disdain in the eyes of anyone\nhe’d ever discussed a foreign war with. There were no stakes for them, and\ntherefore no passion. At worst, it was barely an event. At best, a passing\ninterest. He’d probably been in the same situation himself before.\nBut this war was his and he had to fight back indignity at her dismissal.\n“In Fatrasta,” she asked, “are you a warrior?”\nStyke nodded, one hand twitching for his knife and realizing for the first\ntime it wasn’t there. “Where is my knife?” he asked quietly.\n“I had to take it,” she responded. “You seem prone to violence.”\nStyke crawled to his knees, then gained his feet. “Knife. Now.”\nMaetle set her jaw. A few moments passed before she gestured to her\noffice. “Behind the desk.”\nStyke found his knife and returned it to his side, then lowered himself\nonto Maetle’s office stool. It creaked angrily beneath his weight but did not\ngive way. He was still trying to gain full control of his thoughts and body.\nThe attempt was slow-going, but it seemed to help to talk. “No one has\ndiscovered us?”\n“I put a note outside my door that I am ill,” Maetle said.\n“And no one demands your presence for their own hurts and sicknesses?\nThis compound must have hundreds of people.” He could hear them, when\nhe strained—the sound of children playing, people passing within a few\nyards of this small house. He decided to lower his voice, just to be sure they\nweren’t overheard.\n“Dynize don’t ask questions,” Maetle responded.\n“Ah. Orz mentioned that. Very obedient people.”\n“You don’t approve?”\n“Obedience has its uses.”\n“To society?”\n“To powerful people.”\nMaetle scowled at him. “You don’t believe in obedience to the land? To\nlaws?”\n“I’m a soldier,” Styke said. “Laws only apply to me in times of peace.”\n“You don’t sound happy about that.”\n“I wish society were more consistent. Do you know Fatrastan history?”\n“A little. What they taught us in preparation for the invasion.”\n“I fought in the Fatrastan Revolution. I was a monster for my people,\nand when the war was over, they did this to me.” He pointed to the still-\nvisible scar along his cheekbone that had now been restitched by sorcery\ntwice. He then held up his hand. “And this. I refused to die, so they made\nme a prisoner.”\nMaetle looked horrified. “And yet you still fight for them?”\n“Life is complicated,” Styke said. It was an irony that he considered\nfrom time to time. But he was, he’d decided, fighting for Fatrasta—for the\npeople—and not for the assholes who put him in chains. He shook his head.\n“When will Etzi return? I need to get out of this place. To find… others.”\n“Other foreign soldiers?”\nStyke didn’t respond. Perhaps he’d already said too much.\n“He should be back soon. He never stays at the games longer than he"

        "text": "“Other foreign soldiers?”\nStyke didn’t respond. Perhaps he’d already said too much.\n“He should be back soon. He never stays at the games longer than he\nneeds to.” She looked away when she spoke of him, and Styke thought he\ncaught a hint of something.\n“You like your master?”\n“Of course I do! He’s a good man.”\n“You’re sleeping with him.”\nMaetle’s cheeks reddened. “How dare you.”\nStyke held up his hands at her anger. “Forget I said anything. Tell me\nabout him.”\nMaetle’s mouth formed a hard line and she held her glare for several\nseconds before finally looking away with an irritated sigh. “He’s the head of\na Household. He’s a good master. Thoughtful, fair. He does everything for\nthe sake of the Household. Taking in his brother is the first time I’ve ever\nseen him make a selfish decision.”\n“Selfish?” Styke echoed.\n“Against the Household, I mean. Very dangerous.”\nAnd she was protective of her master. He rubbed his head. She was also\nthe reason he was held up in here for the rest of daylight instead of riding\nhard through the suburbs at the head of his men. “I think I got that.” He\nlooked up sharply and saw that a curtain had been drawn between the\ninfirmary and Maetle’s bedroom and office. “Orz, is he…”\n“Yes,” Maetle answered just a little too quickly. “Dragonmen are very\nhardy. Hardier than I expected, certainly. One of the bolts punctured his left\nlung, but it doesn’t appear to be filling with blood.” She hesitated, and he\ncould see the discomfort in her face. “I know that bone-eye sorcery is\ndifferent from Privileged sorcery. Beyond that…”\n“It might just be enough,” Styke said. He felt like he should be\nambivalent over Orz’s survival—bringing him here was nothing more than\na debt paid. But he still remembered that night at his mother’s grave, and he\nfound himself hoping that the dragonman would pull through. It took him a\nfew moments to realize that his own survival could depend on it—if Orz\ndied, the whole Household might just as well turn on him.\nStyke’s head began to clear, and with little else to do he spent the next\nfew hours questioning Maetle about her country, the language, traditions,\nand everything else he could think of. She seemed more than willing to talk\n—even enthusiastic—and it occurred to him that she’d probably never met\na Kressian who wasn’t a slave or somehow naturalized to Dynize. His\ncuriosity seemed to surprise her, and though she never said as much, he got\nthe impression that the Dynize considered the rest of the world to be\nbarbarians who needed to be saved from themselves.\nWhich, he was almost certain, was how the Kressian countries would\nview the Dynize if the situation were reversed.\nTalking helped stave off the anxiety he had over his men back at the inn\n—but didn’t contain it entirely. He glanced at the window often, counting\ndown the hours until dusk. He was just beginning to lose his patience in the\nlate afternoon when there was a quiet knock on the door.

It was Etzi.\nThe Household head looked pensive—Styke had the distinct impression\nthat he looked that way a lot—and he glanced down at Styke’s knife before\nspeaking.\n“You didn’t tell me that my mother was dead.”\nStyke’s mouth went dry. He glanced at Maetle, whose face had gone\nwhite. “I didn’t think it was the time.”\n“Nor that the dragonman who visited here last night killed her.” Etzi\nheld up one hand to forestall a response. “It is good that you did not. I’m\nnot a violent man, but I would have refused his entry into the Household if I\nhad known it, which would have been suspicious. It might have undone us.”\nHe took a couple of deep breaths. “She died doing what she felt was right.”\nStyke bit his tongue. Hard.\n“My brother?” Etzi asked Maetle, the question hanging in the air.\n“He’s alive,” Maetle answered. “For now.” She hurried behind the\ncurtain and returned a few moments later with a glass of something dark. It\nsmelled like bourbon. Etzi took one sip and handed it back with a gesture of\nthanks.\n“I need to get out of here,” Styke said gently. “I have other\nresponsibilities.”\nEtzi looked him up and down. “I’m sure you do. The men at the inn,\nthey are yours?”\nStyke stiffened.\n“They were taken by the city guard early this morning.”\n“How bad was it?” Styke braced himself.\n“Bad? They didn’t put up a fight. Half of them were too drunk to stand.\nThe other half took their arrest in stride.”\n“And the little girl that was with them?”\nEtzi shook his head. “There was no girl.”\n“Or a Dynize woman?”\nAnother head shake.\nStyke chewed on the inside of his cheek, unsure whether this was good\nnews or bad news. The fact that they hadn’t put up a fight must have been\nJackal’s doing. He’d have realized that it was better to keep them all alive\nand together than get them all killed. And where had Ka-poel and Celine\nslipped off to? Unlike the rest of them, Ka-poel could walk the city at will,\nand Celine had enough Palo in her mongrel blood that she probably\nwouldn’t get a second glance from most people.\n“What are they doing with them?” he asked.\n“Questioning them.” Etzi’s eyes narrowed. “And getting nothing in\nreturn. There’s a Palo with them, and he’s claiming the whole group are\nslaves that have taken a vow of silence. It’s obvious that they’re not slaves.\nWhat they really are has everyone’s curiosity piqued.”\nStyke returned Etzi’s gaze coolly and wondered if the Dynize would\nsummon a bone-eye. All he could do was hope that Ka-poel had taken some\nprecautions.\n“You’re going to make me ask?” Etzi said.\nStyke remained silent.\n“Who are they? Who are you? What are twenty foreign soldiers doing in\nDynize with a disgraced dragonman?”"

What are twenty foreign soldiers doing in\nDynize with a disgraced dragonman?”\nStyke crossed his arms. “Would you believe me if I said we were\ninvading?”\n“No,” Etzi answered immediately. “No, I would not.”\n“Good.” Styke rubbed his eyes. His men imprisoned. Ka-poel and\nCeline in the wind. And himself unable to leave this place for fear of getting\ncaught. Somewhere to their south, the Mad Lancers were biding their time\nin the deep jungle, waiting for Styke to catch up with them. What the pit\ncould he do now?\nThere was another knock on the door, and Styke hid himself around the\ncorner while Etzi answered it. He heard a confused voice speaking in\nDynize. It sounded like the watchman from last night. “Master, there is\nsomeone here demanding to speak with a giant.”\nStyke reached for his knife.\n“Who?” Etzi asked. He sounded as confused at the watchman.\n“A mute woman and her foreign slave girl. They are dressed for travel\nand have three warhorses with them.”\n“Hold on.” Etzi closed the door and turned to Styke, one eyebrow\narched.\nStyke let his hand fall away from his knife, a wave of relief sweeping\nthrough him. That damned blood sorcerer had brought Celine and, from the\nsound of it, had even thought to escape with all their horses. “I suggest\nmaking her comfortable,” Styke told Etzi.\n“Who is she?”\n“The bone-eye who broke Ka-Sedial’s hold on your brother.”\nCHAPTER 29\nJ\nust before dawn, Michel slipped into the catacombs through an old\nbasement entrance in an abandoned townhouse in Upper Landfall. He\ndescended steep hallways and staircases, guiding himself with an oil lantern\nand maps cast to memory. He wasn’t completely certain he was heading the\nright way until the descent flattened out and he came across an alcove\ncarved into the side of the tunnel.\nIn that alcove were stacked twelve crates of Adran rifles. Michel swept\nback the canvas covering the crates and pried one open. Everything there.\nJust as ordered. He couldn’t help but smile to himself. Good old Halifin.\nNeat, punctual, and reliable.\nJust to be sure, Michel checked each of the crates.

This part\nof the quarry was long disused, far from most of the blasting and digging\nand as distant as one could get from the sounds and smells of Greenfire\nDepths without actually leaving it.\nMichel barely had to glance to his right to look down upon a small but\ntidy-looking foreman’s house: Meln-Dun’s residence when he didn’t have\ntime to head to his country manor. Michel watched for several more\nminutes, looking for guards, signs of movement, or anything else\nsuspicious. Nothing. He threw his bag over his shoulder and scrambled\ndown from his hiding spot, crossing to the back of the house in just a few\nsteps.\nHis heart was raging but his head was cool, and Michel carefully\nchecked each step off in the back of his head. No room for mistakes here.\nPicking the lock on the front door took just a handful of seconds. He\nslipped inside, paused to get his bearings. The house was a one-room\nresidence with a wood-burning stove in one corner, a one-person dining\ntable in another, and a card table in the center of the room. Like the outside,\neverything here was tidy. Meln-Dun had a maid come twice a day, his three\nmeals delivered from his favorite restaurant, and few visitors outside of his\nforemen, who came to play cards two nights a week.\nMeln-Dun valued his privacy, and only took his Dynize visitors at his\noffice a few hundred yards from the little house. No whores. No friends.\nMichel had been certain he’d be alone.\nAfter a thorough examination of the house, Michel cracked the door to\nthe one bedroom. One body in the bed. Gentle but deep snoring. No\nweapons within sight. He pulled his bag off his shoulder and produced his\npistol, taking several deep breaths as he left behind Michel Bravis and\nbecame Tellurin the thief-taker. With a sharp inhale, he burst through the\nbedroom door shouting.\n“Meln-Dun! Meln-Dun!”\nThe quarry master leapt from his bed, hands flailing, nightclothes\nasunder and pure confusion covering his face.\nMichel brandished his pistol but did not point it at Meln-Dun. “Quickly,\nmaster, is there anyone here?”\n“What? No, no, of course not!”\n“The Dynize,” Michel said desperately. “Are they near?”\n“No, I…” Meln-Dun’s eyes began to focus and they fell on Michel’s\npistol. “What are you doing?” he asked in horror.\nMichel looked at the pistol as if confused himself, then pointed it at the\nceiling. “Sorry, master, I had to be sure.”\n“Sure about what?” Suspicion crept into Meln-Dun’s tone. “Who are\nyou?” he demanded. “Wait, I know you! You’re—”\n“Tellurin,” Michel stated. “I’ve been working for Dahre. Look, there’s\nlittle time to explain, but Dahre has ordered me to get you out of here.”\n“What are you talking about?”\n“We’ve uncovered a plot.” Michel grabbed Meln-Dun by one shoulder\nto steady him. “Mama Palo, that insidious bitch, has set you up! She’s"

        "text": "“What are you talking about?”\n“We’ve uncovered a plot.” Michel grabbed Meln-Dun by one shoulder\nto steady him. “Mama Palo, that insidious bitch, has set you up! She’s\nconvinced the Dynize that you’re running weapons and spying for the Lady\nChancellor Lindet.”\n“That’s mad!” Meln-Dun continued to flail around, clearly trying to\nfight off the dregs of sleep still clinging to his mind. “Where’s Dahre?”\n“Of course it’s mad, but she’s managed to do it. We uncovered the plot\njust an hour ago. Dahre is trying to clean everything up, but the Dynize\nmight be here at any moment. If they get their hands on you, they’ll execute\nyou without hesitation.” Michel swore several times, working himself into a\ndesperate fury.\n“I’m their friend! They’ve been good to me!”\n“They don’t trust anyone,” Michel hissed. “Why do you think they’ve\nhad that dragonman hanging around the quarry?”\nMeln-Dun’s eyes grew wide in understanding. “That dragonman. Pit.\nOh, pit,” he wailed. “What do we do?” Meln-Dun began to clutch at\nMichel’s arm. Michel smiled inwardly. He had him.\n“It’s all right. We’ll take care of it. I have to get you out of here. We put\nyou in hiding for a couple of weeks and smooth things over with the\nDynize. It’ll take us some time to unwind the evidence that Mama Palo has\nplanted, but I’m convinced we can do it.” Michel gestured. “Quickly, get\ndressed. Grab anything of value. We have to move fast!”\nMeln-Dun threw himself into action, and it quickly became apparent that\nhe’d already put some consideration into what items he’d take with him\nwere he forced to flee, but he’d never actually practiced packing them. He\nattacked his bureau with vigor, dressing as he did a whirlwind job of his\nown bedroom. The wardrobe was flung open, a loose board removed from\nthe floor, and a small strongbox retrieved. Meln-Dun fetched a checkbook,\ntwo thick bundles of Adran krana, and a couple of small leather satchels,\ntossing them all into a shoulder bag not unlike Michel’s.\nWithin five minutes he was standing in the center of the room, looking\naround, breathing heavily. “I think I have everything,” he told Michel with a\nfearful nod. “We go?”\n“Not that way,” Michel said, taking Meln-Dun by the arm. “Out the\nback. Through the window. Let’s go.”\nMeln-Dun crawled out first. Michel hesitated, giving the room a once-\nover as well. While Meln-Dun had been trying to think of other valuables to\ntake with him, Michel gave it a critical eye. The place looked, even to an\namateur, like Meln-Dun had fled in a panic.\nPerfect.\nHe crawled out after the quarry boss and left the window open behind\nthem. He took Meln-Dun by the arm. “This way,” he ordered. They\nscrambled up the rock face, Michel being sure to scuff and mark the rock as\nmuch as possible, leaving a clear trail behind him. They went up and over,\nand Michel showed Meln-Dun the narrow entrance."

They went up and over,\nand Michel showed Meln-Dun the narrow entrance.\n“Pit,” Meln-Dun exclaimed in wonder as he crawled inside. “Just feet\nfrom where I was sleeping. I had no idea this was here!”\nMichel didn’t answer him. They gained the main tunnel and were able to\nstand, and Michel felt around for his lamp. He was able to get it lit within a\nfew moments, illuminating the tunnel and Meln-Dun’s frightened face. That\nexpression almost—almost—made Michel feel bad for what he was doing.\nBut it didn’t quite crack it. Meln-Dun had executed an old woman to\ncement his own position and then sold out the Palo to the Dynize invasion.\nThere was no sympathy for a man like that.\n“Where do we go now?” Meln-Dun asked.\n“This way.” Michel led Meln-Dun down the tunnel, past the covered\ncrates of Adran rifles. Meln-Dun was so busy fretting he didn’t even glance\nat them. They took a right turn and continued down a long hallway that\nzigzagged for some length roughly parallel to the wall of Greenfire Depths.\nMichel could hear Meln-Dun muttering to himself and half listened, noting\nthe fear and desperation turn to indignation, then turn to anger.\n“How dare they?” Meln-Dun asked himself. “How could they turn on\nme like this, after everything I’ve done? Greenfire Depths is mine! Mine!\nThey need me if they want to keep the Palo contained.”\nThe muttering erased any trace of guilt that Michel still felt. Once the\nanger began to grow, he put Meln-Dun in front of him. The quarry boss\ndidn’t even seem to notice the change, or the pistol that Michel now had\npointed at his back.\n“Take a left,” Michel told him. “Down there. Good, now to the right.\nOkay, we’re almost there.”\n“Where is there?” Meln-Dun asked.\n“To a safe place,” Michel answered. They took a short set of worn stairs\nup and past a handful of marked tombs, emerging into the basement of an\nold Kressian church. Michel ordered Meln-Dun to climb up into the chapel,\nand they soon emerged into a worn-out room with a handful of pews, lit\nonly by Michel’s lamp and a sliver of morning light coming in through the\none stained-glass window high up in the roof of the building.\n“Is this it?” Meln-Dun asked, looking around.\nMichel let out a long, relieved sigh and dropped into one of the pews.\n“This is it.”\nThey remained in silence for nearly a minute before Meln-Dun began to\nget antsy. “What are we waiting for?”\n“Friends,” Michel said loudly. The code word echoed off the high chapel\nceiling. He’d barely said it when a pair of figures emerged from behind the\naltar. Another came up from behind one of the pews. The chapel doors were\nthrown open, and four more entered.\nMeln-Dun whirled, peering at faces in the dim light. “Dahre? Is that"

Tellurin, who are\nthese people?”\nJiniel was the first figure Michel recognized. Ichtracia stepped into the\nlight of his lamp a few seconds later. Michel lifted his pistol and pointed it\nat Meln-Dun. “Meln-Dun, meet Mama Palo.”\nThe quarry head tried to run. He caught a fist in his belly and doubled\nover, collapsing to the feet of one of Jiniel’s foot soldiers. She looked down\nat him dispassionately until another foot soldier got a good look at his face.\n“It’s him, ma’am.”\n“What’s going on?” Meln-Dun moaned from the ground. He was\nsilenced by a swift kick from one of the foot soldiers.\n“Son of a bitch,” Jiniel breathed. “I can’t believe you actually pulled that\noff.”\nMichel put up his pistol. “He’s yours,” he reported.\n“And what did you leave behind?”\n“The Yaret Household will receive anonymous evidence of Meln-Dun’s\ncollusion with the enemy general Lady Flint within the hour,” Michel said.\n“They’ll rush to confront him and find that he’s fled ahead of any\naccusations that might be leveled. They’ll further find a stash of Adran\nrifles just behind his house. The evidence will all be there. They’ll shut\ndown his quarry and put a price on his head.”\n“How can you be sure?” Jiniel asked.\n“I’m not completely. But that’s how they’ll operate. The best part of all\nof this is they’ll tear apart his organization. Imprison a few for questioning.\nScatter the rest. If they try to cover up his alleged involvement with Lady\nFlint, we’ll leak it to the newspapers.”\n“You tricked me,” Meln-Dun hissed in horror.\nIchtracia laughed. Pure mirth, tinged with a small, terrifying splash of\ncruelty. Michel stood up. “Good-bye, Meln-Dun.” He took Jiniel by the arm\nand led her out through the front doors of the chapel, then turned to her.\n“Remember, you’re not to kill him.”\n“He deserves it,” Jiniel sniffed.\n“I have my reasons.”\n“You’re going soft?”\n“Softness has nothing to do with it,” Michel replied. “What I have in\nmind for Meln-Dun is far better than a quick death.”\nCHAPTER 30\nV\nlora examined both the Adran and Dynize camps in the morning gloom.\nSmoke from the charred remains of the southern Dynize camp obscured her\nview and made her eyes water.

It had been hastily abandoned in the wee hours of the\nmorning, leaving behind tents, unnecessary gear, and random spots of tidy\noccupation where the camp followers hadn’t been fast enough to follow\ntheir retreating army. Vlora’s own soldiers were currently picking through\nthe scattered remains to look for anything of value that General Etepali\nmight have left behind.\nVlora stared at it all through bleary eyes, functioning on a few hours of\ndeep sleep, smarting from fresh stitches from one of her medics. Last night\nfelt like a nightmare to her, a series of half-remembered events that barely\nformed a cohesive narrative. Yet here she was, looking at what remained.\nSomeone had thrown a blanket over her shoulders at some point, and she\nclung to it like a drowning man to a plank of wood. Beside her, General\nSabastenien read out reports. She half listened, nodding when she was\nexpected to nod and saying a word or two when she was expected to\nrespond.\n“Final word has come in from our scouts,” he was in the middle of\nsaying. “It seems that once General Etepali realized what was happening\nlast night, she woke her soldiers and organized an attack. They pushed our\nflank hard—that was a stroke of brilliance, having us build those barricades,\nby the way—but once they realized they couldn’t take advantage of the\nattack, they pulled up stakes and retreated. They’re about five miles directly\nto our southwest now.”\n“About what I expected,” Vlora said dully.\n“I wonder why she attacked our flank in our camp,” he mused out loud,\n“rather than attacking our troops that were undertaking the slaughter of her\nallies.”\nVlora roused herself enough to look at Sabastenien. “Because she didn’t\nexpect us to leave anyone to defend our rear. She expected us to be\ncompletely absorbed in the slaughter, which would have allowed her to\ncrush our camp and then sweep in behind us. That would have been more\neffective than going to the aid of her allies.”\nSabastenien blinked at her. “She allowed her allies to be slaughtered as a\ndistraction?”\n“It might have worked, too. It’s why I left Nila and Bo back in the\ncamp.”\n“I suppose you’re right.” Sabastenien cleared his throat. “She managed\nto do some damage, I’ll give her credit for that. Most of our casualties last\nnight came from her. About two thousand men killed or wounded.” He let\nout a half sigh, half laugh. “Initial estimates on the Dynize are twenty\nthousand casualties. I’d say that’s a resounding victory. Congratulations,\nLady Flint.”\nVlora tried to smile. “Thank you,” she whispered.\n“General, could you excuse us for a moment?” It was Bo, sidling up to\nVlora’s left and nodding at Sabastenien. Bo looked a little worse for the\nwear, with bags under his eyes and a tiny bit of his hair singed off the top.\nVlora wondered just how close Etepali’s Privileged had gotten to\noverwhelming him and Nila.\n“Of course,” Sabastenien replied, tipping his hat to Vlora. “Lady Flint.\nMagus Borbador.” He retreated down the hillside."

They were barely inside before Bo released her and\nbegan to pace violently, then finally rounded on her. “What the pit is wrong\nwith you?” he demanded.\nShe tried to find her voice, failed.\n“Are you trying to get yourself killed? Are you that bloody-minded right\nnow that you accompanied our troops on a night attack in your condition?”\nUnder normal circumstances she would have snapped right back. His\ntone was accusatory and venomous. Nobody talked to her like that. But all\nshe could see was the faces of her dead grenadiers.\nBo continued, “I just talked to Davd. He saw that fight with the\ndragonmen. Said that you would have died before he had the chance to load\nhis rifle if not for a handful of cuirassiers that rode down that dragonman.\nBlind luck. The cuirassiers didn’t even notice you.” He leaned forward,\ntaking her gently by the sides of the face. She could see the anger in his\neyes warring with concern. “You are not a powder mage anymore, Vlora.\nYou can’t do that!”\n“Just because I’m no longer a killing machine doesn’t mean that I\nshouldn’t lead from the front,” Vlora managed.\n“Yes, it does,” Bo responded, letting go of her and resuming his pacing.\n“And we’re not just talking about the lack of your sorcery. You almost died\nless than two months ago. You shouldn’t even be out of bed for more than\nan hour or two, let alone charging into an enemy camp in the middle of the\nnight. You…” He stumbled on his words, turning to peer at her face. A\nsudden realization seemed to dawn in his eyes. “You were trying to get\nyourself killed,” he whispered.\n“Don’t be absurd.” The very idea cut through Vlora, stunning her.\n“This is about Olem, isn’t it?” he asked. “Did you engineer this whole\nbattle, planning on getting yourself killed over some soldier?”\n“Olem isn’t some soldier,” Vlora finally snapped. “He is the love of my\nlife and he’s your friend. He abandoned us. Me. He walked away from this\nthing, and…” Vlora sputtered, her words stumbling into a cough that\nthreatened to knock her off her feet. “I didn’t engineer anything,” she\nfinally managed. “I made a tactical decision.”\n“A tactical decision to get yourself killed,” Bo said, his voice rising.\n“You know that this isn’t just about you, right? This is about an entire army\nthat crossed an ocean to help you stop something horrible. Never mind that\nyou have more important things to worry about than Olem—people here are\nready to die for you, Vlora. They have died for you. Or have you already\nforgotten the grenadiers who were torn apart by those dragonmen?”\nFaces flashed across Vlora’s vision. Bloody, startled faces.

Nila\nstrode into the room and grabbed Bo by the shoulder. “Out,” she ordered,\nshoving him back out the flap before he could respond.\nVlora stared into the middle distance, unable to move, unable to\nrespond. Had she tried to kill herself? Death by enemy wasn’t unheard of.\nOfficers whose lives had taken a dark turn and volunteered for dangerous\nmissions. Soldiers who charged without orders. Was it possible that she’d\ntried to off herself, without her even knowing?\nBo’s words suddenly hit her—she’d heard them when he spoke, but now\nthat he’d been shoved outside, they seemed to slam into her gut like a kick\nfrom a horse. He was right, of course. She’d gotten her bodyguard killed.\nAll of them would still be here if not for her insistence on charging in with\nthe infantry. She lifted her eyes, looking at Nila without seeing her. “They’ll\ncall it a victory,” she muttered.\nNila sighed. “Yes, they will. And so will you.”\n“I can’t. Have you seen that?” She pointed a finger toward the Dynize\ncamp.\n“I’ve spent the better part of the morning helping the wounded,” Nila\nanswered gently. She came to Vlora’s side, and Vlora allowed herself to be\nguided to her cot. They both sat down, and Nila pulled Vlora’s head against\nher shoulder.\nWithin moments Vlora was weeping. She didn’t even feel it start, but\nsuddenly the tears were flowing and her shoulders heaving. She felt a hand\non the back of her head, gently stroking her hair, and Nila spoke in a soft,\nsoothing voice.\n“The victory is in how few of those dead and wounded are your\ncountrymen,” she said. “So very few. These soldiers are your responsibility,\nand if you have to resort to a dirty trick to keep them alive, then so be it.\nYou’ve done it, and you can move on. The Dynize are not your\nresponsibility. They belong to whoever sent them to die by your hand.\n“I know that you miss Olem. We all do. He’s a fantastic commanding\nofficer and a friend to us all. I don’t know where he’s gone. I don’t even\nknow if he’s truly abandoned us. What Davd told you the other day was true\n—you betrayed him at the Crease. You did it as a lover rather than as a\ncommanding officer, and that’s what hurt him. You have to let that go.\nAdom willing, when this is all over, you’ll be able to find him and make\nthis right.\n“At this moment, however, you have a decision to make: You can back\nout of this. Cede command. There are a half-dozen generals in your army\nwho are all the equal of anything the Dynize can throw at us, and not a one\nof them would think less of you for stepping down after all that has\nhappened.

Forget Olem’s absence.\nFocus on your goals and leave the self-recriminations for when this is all\nfinished.”\nNila fell silent, and Vlora wept out her anger, grief, pain, and\nfrustrations. They remained in that embrace for some time, long after Vlora\nhad dried her tears and her mind and heart felt empty, a shell devoid of the\ntorrent that had so recently been raging within her. The ability for rational\nthought finally returned, and Vlora used it to probe within herself, looking\nfor that ugly, furious thing that had dominated her thoughts for so long. It\nwas still there, lurking in the corners of her mind, but it felt smaller and\ndiminished.\nShe finally sat up, looking Nila in the eyes. “Thank you.”\n“Of course. Bo’s good at a lot of things. Dealing with complex emotion\nisn’t one of them.”\nVlora barked a laugh. “That would require him to let his guard down.”\n“You say that like it’s not a family trait.”\n“Unfair.”\n“But true.” Nila lifted the hem of her dress and used it to dry Vlora’s\ncheeks. In all the time they’d known each other, it was probably the most\nintimate gesture that Nila had made toward her.\nThey sat in companionable silence for some time. Vlora stared at her\nhands, deep in thought, considering everything that Nila had said. She was\nright, of course. She could step down. Any of her generals could conduct\nthis campaign and do Adro proud in the course of doing so. But none of\nthem had seen the godstone, felt its dark power. None of them knew,\nfirsthand, all the things she knew. They hadn’t met Lindet and Ka-Sedial.\nThey hadn’t defended Landfall.\nThe moment she had accepted command of the army, she had taken\nresponsibility. And she had to accept that. She might be physically and\nemotionally fragile. But she was still sound of mind and great of will. Any\nexcuse that she gave in ceding command might be accepted by everyone\nelse. But she’d never forgive herself.\nVlora stood and walked to the tent, poking her head outside. Norrine\nwas standing guard just a few feet away, and Vlora wondered if she’d heard\nthe exchange. If she had, none of it showed on her face. “Pass on orders for\nthe general staff,” she told Norrine. “I’m allowing one day for our men to\nrest. Our medics are to treat our wounded first, then the enemy. Let General\nEtepali know that we won’t interfere with her retrieving her dead. We won’t\nbe taking any prisoners—anyone we scooped up will be left in her care.”\nNorrine nodded. “Yes, ma’am.

But cast it off I will. This is a war I must win myself.”\nCHAPTER 31\nT\nhe Etzi Household infirmary was crowded with people, all of them\nstanding in a circle around the unconscious form of Orz. Ka-poel stood at\nhis head, with Celine beside her, and Styke at his feet. Maetle and Etzi\nremained on the other side. The latter two stared at Ka-poel as if she were\nsome kind of adder slithering around their feet, while she didn’t seem to\nnotice their attention.\nI can speed up his healing, Ka-poel said, translated by Celine into\nAdran, but not by much. The sorcery that surrounds dragonmen is similar\nto the link I have with Taniel—but rather than a constant exchange of\nsorcerous energy, it is a onetime thing: a blessing of sorts. I think I can\nstrengthen it a bit. Like repairing a ship with material stronger than it was\noriginally made from.\n“Do what you can,” Styke replied. “We need him.”\nKa-poel looked at Etzi. You’re his brother. If you’re willing, I’ll use\nsome of your strength.\n“Neither Orz nor I have ever been on good terms with bone-eyes,” Etzi\nresponded. “Orz can’t speak for himself, but I certainly don’t want you\ncutting into me.”\nKa-poel made a gesture that was somewhere halfway between accepting\nand rude. I’ll use my own, then. She immediately set to work pricking her\nthumb with a needle from her satchel and touching the blood to Orz’s lips.\nShe worked slowly and deliberately, all focus on the body before her. The\ngroup watched silently for several minutes until Etzi finally spoke up.\n“So the Fatrastans have bone-eyes. None of our spies told us that.”\nStyke bit his tongue. He preferred to be straightforward, but even he\nknew when to let an assumption lie. If anyone, including Etzi, found out\nexactly who Ka-poel was, they might lose their only chance of surviving in\nthis damned city. He gently tapped on the small of Celine’s back—a signal\nfor her to stay quiet—and just grunted in response. “Your Ka-Sedial is\nfinding out a lot about Fatrasta that he didn’t know.”\n“And may it give him the worst kind of headache,” Etzi said, as if\ninvoking a curse. He rubbed at his temples.\nStyke eyeballed Etzi. “I thought you were loyal to Ka-Sedial.”\n“I am loyal to the empire,” Etzi replied, ducking his head slightly as if\nrealizing he’d let something slip. “I am loyal to my family and my\nHousehold. Ka-Sedial is none of those. Now, what do I do with you?”\nStyke had no response. He had no plan. Everything had been predicated"

Everything had been predicated\non getting through the city unnoticed and meeting up with Ibana farther\ndown the coast. So far he’d had no indication that Ibana’s army had even\nlanded—which could mean that they hadn’t, or it could mean they’d\navoided detection. And now twenty of his men had been arrested by the\nDynize. He’d considered a thousand different courses of action over the last\ncouple of hours and had been unable to land on any that weren’t completely\nsuicidal. He just didn’t know enough about the layout of the city, the\ngarrison, or the people to come up with anything proper.\n“You’re going to help us, right?” Celine asked. So much for keeping\nquiet.\nEtzi blinked at her. “You’re a bold little one.”\n“You have no idea,” Styke muttered.\n“Your brother is going to live,” Celine said. “We’ve saved him, so\nyou’re going to save us. Right?”\n“It is more complicated than my brother’s life,” Etzi told Celine. “It is\nthe lives of my entire Household.” He turned his attention back to Styke. “I\nwill speak bluntly. Fraternal love is only some of the reason I hid you and\nOrz from the dragonman last night.”\nStyke straightened, listening carefully.\n“Orz probably does not know this himself. If he was only released a\ncouple of months ago, he will not be up on local politics.”\n“Which are?”\nEtzi gave a hard sigh and said something to Maetle in Dynize that was\ntoo quick for Styke to follow.\n“It’s your decision, master,” she responded.\nEtzi rubbed his temples again. “Dynize has been on the brink of a new\ncivil war for almost two years. Sedial’s consolidation of power has divided\nthe nation, and his invasion of Fatrasta has both taxed everyone’s loyalty\nand kept us from tearing one another apart. He’s probably aware through his\npuppet-spies that the capital is politically volatile right now, but if he knew\nthe true extent of it, he would be back here at the head of his biggest army.”\nThis sounded very much like information Styke could use. If he had the\nbrains to figure out how. He was a soldier, not a politician. “It’s that bad?”\n“It is. The death of my mother, the search for you and Orz, even the\narrest of your soldiers—these things happened practically hours ago and\nthey’ve already sparked a wave of debates on everything from slave policy,\nto the use of sorcery by the government, to questioning Sedial’s authority\nall over again. I went to the games earlier today to hear the gossip.\nAssassinations happen from time to time, of course, but they don’t usually\nhappen in the… I suppose you’d call them the ‘middle-class suburbs.’ She\nwas a retired Household head. She should not have been collateral\ndamage.”\n“So you hid us because you might be able to use us?”\nEtzi gave him a sallow smile. “As I said, times are uncertain. Despite\nmy brother’s disgrace, he is still a dragonman. And you are the man who\nsaved him, so…”"

And you are the man who\nsaved him, so…”\n“I’ll try to stay useful.”\n“I’m not entirely certain how,” Etzi said. A troubled look crossed his\nface, and after several moments of silence he produced a piece of paper\nfrom his pocket and tapped it against his brother’s leg. “Tell me something,\nBen.”\nStyke shrugged at him to go on.\n“When someone in Fatrasta goes to university for an education, do they\nusually go on to work in their field of study?”\n“Usually…,” Styke said. “But not all the time.”\n“My own education was in the legal system.”\n“Oh?” The word must have sounded more sarcastic than Styke had\nmeant, because Etzi chuckled dryly.\n“We don’t operate entirely on traditions and imperial word,” Etzi said.\n“In fact, the emperor rarely involves himself in day-to-day politics. He lets\nSedial and the Household Quorum—our governing body—take care of all\nthat. Sedial is far away right now.”\nStyke could see the thoughts turning behind Etzi’s eyes. “And\nuniversities?”\n“Sorry,” Etzi said, passing a hand over his eyes. “I was a legal student. I\nwas very good at it, and I’d intended on making my career as a lawyer. I\nwouldn’t—I thought at the time—inherit the Household until I was quite\nold. But then Orz was disgraced, my parents stepped down as heads, and I\nfound myself here.” He gestured at the compound surrounding them. He\ntapped the paper against his brother’s leg once more and unfolded it. “Laws\nare often put into place by the powerful to control the weak. But they can\nalso be used against the powerful—especially when those powerful people\naren’t present. Do you know what this is?”\nStyke shook his head.\n“Maetle took it out of Orz’s pocket last night. It was sealed in wax, well-\nprotected from the elements. It’s stamped with Sedial’s seal and signed by\nhis own hand, and says that Orz is working on a conditional pardon on a\ntask from the Great Ka himself.”\nStyke finally began to follow. “What do you mean to do with it? Claim\npublicly that Orz was unjustly attacked by assassins?”\n“Exactly.” Etzi had a strange look in his eye now. Styke had seen that\nlook before—on Ibana, when she thought that one of his insane ideas might\nactually work.\n“But the assassin could only have been waiting for him at Sedial’s\ncommand,” he protested.\n“Give me a timeline of events. When did he betray Ka-Sedial’s orders?”\nStyke ran through a very basic outline of the past six weeks, leaving out\nthe fact that he’d been separated from an army intent on capturing the very\ncity in which they stood. It wasn’t an entire lie—but it did make it out to\nseem like Styke and his men had come from Starlight to help Orz in return\nfor his sparing Styke’s life. Both Celine and Ka-poel looked at him a couple\ntimes during the story but neither tried to correct him."

When Styke had finished, he said, “Based on your\nown version of events, a messenger from Sedial could not have beaten him\nback to Dynize.”\n“Sedial must have given the order through a puppet.”\nEtzi snapped his fingers. “Exactly! Puppets are not acknowledged by the\nlegal system. Everyone knows they exist. Everyone knows they are wrong.\nBut the bone-eyes have always had power and they avoid being held\naccountable by pretending—through laws—that puppets don’t exist.”\n“So you’re saying that any order given through a puppet is illegal?”\n“Not technically illegal. It just doesn’t hold any legal weight.” Etzi\nbounced the paper up and down in his hand. “This carries legal weight.”\n“So you’re not going to hide him?” Styke asked.\n“It would be foolish to try. The longer I keep him hidden, the more they\ncan claim that I know I’ve done something wrong. But if I take his presence\npublic, with this conditional pardon…”\n“You’re taking the fight to Sedial’s representatives in the city.”\nEtzi grinned in a way that reminded Styke of Orz. “And that bastard\nwho murdered my mother.”\nStyke knew right away that he was out of his depth. He didn’t know the\nlegal system in his own country, let alone in this strange place. He could do\nnothing but trust that Etzi knew what he was doing. But this all dealt with\nthe Orz problem and Etzi’s Household. “And me and my men?” he asked.\nEtzi’s mind was clearly elsewhere. “You saved my brother from\nassassins. Legally, I’m honor-bound to protect you.”\nStyke bit his tongue, considering what to tell Etzi. On one hand, the\narmy down south might never even have landed—they might have sunk, or\nheaded back to New Starlight, or landed somewhere far from here. On the\nother hand, if word suddenly arrived about Styke’s army, all of them\ncarrying the same skull-and-lance banner that he had in his saddlebags, it\nmight get both him and Etzi’s Household executed as spies.\nIt didn’t feel right to treat a host in such a way. But Styke’s primary\nconcern had to be staying alive—at least until he knew whether Ibana had\nactually landed and decided to wait out his arrival. “So what do I do?”\n“You remain here, as my guest. Sedial’s representatives in the city will\nask for clarification from him directly, which will take at least six weeks. I\nmuddy the water legally, Orz heals—he just needs to be able to ride—and\nwe get you all moving again.”\n“And my men?”\n“As I said, I’ll muddy the waters. I’ll put effort into seeing them released\nas accessories to whatever task it is that Orz is up to.” He paused, frowned.\n“Dynize is a tinderbox right now. I suspect that either Sedial’s allies will try\nto keep this quiet, letting me have my way in order to keep from stoking\nmore discontent…”\n“Or?” Styke asked.\n“Or they will make an issue out of it.”"

There was a resolve there that he hadn’t\nseen last night. It made him like the man, for all his bookish nature. “You’re\nsure that you’re up to protecting us?”\n“At the end of the day, I can claim ignorance. I protected my brother,\nwho I thought had been pardoned.” Etzi paused thoughtfully. His nostrils\nflared and he leaned across Orz. “No. That’s not just it. That dragonman\nmurdered my mother.

I’ll ask you to hide in here for another day while I prepare.”\nCHAPTER 32\nM\ny love is dead.\nIt was the last entry into Field Marshal Tamas’s journal for almost\nthirteen months, and Vlora found herself staring at that page for hours on\nend. She examined the paper, stained with thirty-year-old teardrops. She\nstudied the letters, written in a trembling hand. She sat in contemplation,\nstaring at nothing with the journal open to that page on her lap.\nTwo days had passed since what the men had taken to calling the\nMidnight Massacre. It wasn’t a name that would reflect well on Vlora in the\nhistory books, but she did not contest it. How could she? In those two days\nshe had searched Tamas’s journal for his mistakes—for any campaigns that\nhad gone poorly, atrocities attached to his name, Pyrrhic victories. She’d\nfound records of every one of those things, but he’d never written in terms\nof absolute regrets. The closest he’d ever come to self-recrimination was\nending three of his entries with the words “I will learn from this.”\nShe knew that he had regrets. She’d spent her teens in his household,\nlistening to stories about the Gurlish campaigns over the dinner table. It\nmade her wonder if perhaps he knew that others might study this journal for\nposterity and he was presenting a confident face for history.\nWhich made this one, raw entry all the more emphatic. My love is dead.\nNothing more. Just a date—the date that he would have been informed that\nhis wife had been executed by the Kez. Everything about that page spoke of\ngrief, as one might expect. Had Tamas been a normal person, this page\nwould be nothing more than a record of the death of a loved one. But Tamas\nwasn’t normal, and the following entry—those thirteen months later—\nwould no doubt give goose bumps to anyone with even the faintest\nknowledge of recent history.\nVengeance. Retribution. Justice. There is no word strong enough for\nwhat I am about to put in motion. Whether I succeed or fail, history\nwill remember me as a man with ambitions. I spit on the very word.\nThis is not about ambition. There is nothing I could gain that will fill\nmy heart. I only seek to expunge those who took her from me. I will\nerase their legacies from history or die in the attempt.\nThey have no idea what they’ve done."

        "text": "my heart. I only seek to expunge those who took her from me. I will\nerase their legacies from history or die in the attempt.\nThey have no idea what they’ve done.\nIt would be well over a decade from the time this entry was written to\nthe day that Tamas overthrew the last king of Adro and provoked a war that\nwould see the king of Kez murdered by his own kin. Vlora shuddered upon\nthe reading.\nIn the context of history, this was a declaration of war against the noble\ninstitutions of two countries. A war that the son of a poor apothecary would\none day win. Weighty words. Significant. But after the Midnight Massacre,\nVlora couldn’t help but see the cost of them. Hundreds of thousands had\ndied. Millions had suffered. All for the grief of one man. She couldn’t\ncondone that, just as she couldn’t condone her own poor decisions in the\nwake of her loss.\nI will learn from this. She took a deep breath and closed the journal,\nsetting it on her pillow and falling into a long, thoughtful contemplation.\nOutside her tent, she could hear the sounds of an army breaking camp, the\njoking of two porters while they waited for her to vacate her own quarters\nso they could pack her tent and baggage into a cart.\nShe put on her jacket and bicorn, using her sword as a cane as she\nlimped out of the tent and squinted into the morning light. There was a light\nmist on the broken terrain of eastern Fatrasta, burning away quickly beneath\nthe intensity of the rising sun. The army was spread across several rolling,\nabandoned cotton farms and she felt as if she was looking at that sea of\ntents with new eyes. She had to change. To learn. To become better.\nDavd was on watch outside her tent. He stiffened when she emerged,\nsnapping a salute. The two young porters dashed a last joke between them\nand then came to attention. She waved one hand at them. “Five minutes,”\nshe said. “Make yourselves scarce, then come back and break everything\ndown.”\n“Yes, ma’am!” they replied, chasing each other off into the camp.\nTheir absence left a loud silence between Vlora and Davd. He stared\nstraight ahead, rifle shouldered, his posture painfully stiff.\n“At ease,” she told him.\nHe didn’t move.\nShe clenched her teeth. Learn. Letting out a long breath, she said,\n“Davd, I want to apologize for the other day. You were only telling me what\nI asked to hear, and my outburst was entirely inappropriate.”\nIt didn’t seem possible for Davd to stiffen further. His shoulders\ntightened and his hands clenched his rifle until his knuckles were white. “It\nwas my fault, ma’am.”\n“Look at me,” Vlora said.\nDavd flinched.\n“Look at me,” Vlora commanded.\nDavd’s head gradually turned until they looked each other in the eye.\n“Ma’am,” he said, swallowing hard.\n“It’s not your fault. It’s mine. For the last two years, you powder mages\nhave been among my most valued companions. You aren’t just subordinate\nofficers; you are friends. I shouldn’t have done anything to compromise\nthat. Please forgive me.”"

Please forgive me.”\nA few moments passed before, like a deflating watchman’s balloon,\nDavd sagged. “Of course, ma’am.”\nVlora reached out and touched Davd on the elbow. “Thank you. I’m\ngoing to try to be a better officer. I’m going to try to learn from my\nmistakes.”\n“You aren’t—”\nVlora cut him off gently. “No platitudes. I get enough of those from my\ngeneral staff. The rest of this war will be painful. I need all the friends I can\nget, and I hope you’re one that I can count on the most.”\n“Without question.” The formality had left his voice, but his posture was\nstill overly rigid. It would take time for their relationship to mend. Vlora\nhoped that it might one day return to what it once was. She gave him a\ngrateful nod.\n“I’m going to find Bo. Accompany me?”\nThey found Borbador wearing a gaudy silk dressing gown, puffing on\nhis pipe while a dozen porters broke down the small canvas palace that he\nand Nila called a traveling tent. Nila was nowhere to be seen, but a half-\ndozen officers were gathered around Bo, wearing nothing more than what\nVlora could only assume were Bo’s extra dressing gowns. They stared\nbleary-eyed at the porters as if they’d badly overslept and had been kicked\nout of the tent. Only Bo was fully awake, as if this were a normal ritual for\nhim.\nOne of the officers spotted Vlora, whispered something to his\ncompanions, and the whole group scattered. Vlora tried not to memorize\ntheir faces—she didn’t want to know—and came up to stand beside Bo.\nDavd gave them a respectful distance.\n“You weren’t kidding about working your way through my officer corps,\nwere you?”\n“Not at all,” Bo replied happily.\n“I would insist on being invited to one of your parties, but that would\nprobably be gross, wouldn’t it?”\nBo cocked an eyebrow at her. “Gross has nothing to do with it. You’d\nbring the mood down like nothing else.”\n“I can be fun.”\nBo barked a laugh so hard that it threw him into a coughing fit. He\ndoubled over, slapping his knees, until Vlora thumped him on the back. He\nwiped a tear out of the corner of his eye and recovered, one last chuckle\nescaping his lips. “Right. You’re just a barrel of laughs. Especially these\ndays.”\n“That hurts,” Vlora replied. It did a little, but the arm that Bo draped\ncompanionably over her shoulders helped take the sting out.\n“My dear sister, you wouldn’t know what to do at an orgy. And I mean\nthat as a compliment. You’re a very organized, ordered person. A dozen\nlimbs going every which way would just put you into a fury.”\n“Thanks. I think.”\n“No problem. How soon are we marching?”\n“The head of the column has already hit the road.”\n“Ah. I should probably put pants on. Oi! You there, don’t pack that"

You there, don’t pack that\ntrunk. It’s got my pants in it!”\nVlora examined the side of Bo’s face. It was easy to write off his\nexcessive debauchery as the habits of a Privileged, but he also used it to\nbury his own deep trauma. She decided, in light of her recent realizations,\nthat she should judge him less for it.\n“I need a favor,” she said.\n“Oh?”\n“I need a real, honest answer. Do you have any idea where Olem went?”\nBo froze. “No?” he said.\n“Are you lying to me?”\n“No,” he said somewhat more confidently.\nShe stared at him, looking him in the eye until he began to squirm. “I\nhave an idea,” he finally said. “But I can’t be certain. He didn’t say\nanything when he left, but everyone I’ve asked seems to think he didn’t\nwant to be followed or found.”\n“Can you spare a couple of plainclothes scouts?” she asked.\n“You mean spies?”\n“Yes, I mean spies.”\nBo’s nose wrinkled. “You want me to chase him down?”\n“I just want you to find him. I’ll write four copies of a letter for your\nspies to carry. Once they find him, I just want them to hand over the letter.\nNo need for anything else.”\n“What’s in the letter?”\n“An apology.”\n“Probably a good idea.”\nVlora narrowed her eyes. “Well?”\n“Well what?”\n“Will you help me?”\nBo clicked his tongue thoughtfully. “Of course I’ll help you. You think I\nwould dare stand in the way of true love?”\n“Don’t,” she warned.\n“Sorry,” he said immediately. “I don’t mean to make light. I know\nyou’re hurting. I’ll do what I can, but I can’t promise results.”\n“I just need a letter delivered. No other expectations.”\nHe considered for a moment. “Yes, all right. I can do that.”\n“Thank you,” Vlora said quietly. “As you said, I’m an organized person.\nI’m trying to put my personal life in order so that I can finish this\ncampaign.”\n“Good idea.”\nShe let the remark pass. “How do things look between here and the\nUpper Hadshaw?”\n“I talked to one of your scouts about twenty minutes ago. Looks like\nGeneral Etepali’s army is still at the site of the Midnight Massacre, cleaning\nthings up and helping the wounded. Seems she’s going to be a bit more\ncautious about getting between you and your goals.”\n“You know,” Vlora said wryly, “I should have that scout shot for\nreporting to you before reporting to me.”\n“Oh, come off it. They reported to your general staff before me. Besides,\nyou and I are on the same side.” Bo grinned at her, but the smile faltered.\n“Are you sure about leaving Etepali behind us?”\n“Not at all. But speed is of the essence right now. If I take the time to\ndeal with her, we might lose whatever the Dynize recovered from Yellow\nCreek.”"

If I take the time to\ndeal with her, we might lose whatever the Dynize recovered from Yellow\nCreek.”\nBo pursed his lips, nodding. “Fair enough. As far as we know, the road\nbetween here and the Upper Hadshaw is clear. We still have one Dynize\narmy about twenty miles due south and holding their position. A second\nDynize army is about forty miles to our southwest and marching to join the\nfirst. They probably found out about the Midnight Massacre yesterday, and\nI imagine that, like Etepali, it will make them more cautious.”\n“Good. Then we’ll march double-time to the Upper Hadshaw. If we put\nour backs against the river, we won’t have anyone behind us anymore.”\n“And as many as three field armies in front of us.”\n“We’ll deal with that when it happens.”\n“Oh goodie,” Bo said flatly. “I do have some bad news.”\nVlora ran a hand over her face. “Is this news that I want to hear?”\n“No. But you need to.”\n“Shit. Go ahead.”\nInstead of answering, Bo walked away. He didn’t go far, stopping at the\ntrunk he’d yelled for the porters to set aside. He opened the top and threw\noff his robe without ceremony or an ounce of propriety. He rummaged\naround, producing a pair of pants with an “Ah-ha!” and began to dress.\nOnce he’d found a shirt, he finally looked up with a grave expression.\n“The politicians have arrived,” he said.\n“Excuse me?”\n“I had to do a lot of wrangling to take an entire field army out of Adro.\nEven if most of these soldiers weren’t on active duty, they’re still Adran\ncitizens, and this isn’t just one crack brigade off playing mercenary. Their\ndeparture threw the entire Adran legislature into a tizzy. I had hoped it\nwould take them months to get their act together and send someone after\nus.”\nVlora felt a creeping despair. “They’ve sent someone to stop me?”\n“You’re getting forty thousand Adrans involved in a foreign war,” Bo\nsaid. “Of course they’ve sent someone to stop you. That doesn’t mean\nthey’re going to succeed, but they can probably be a huge pain in the ass.”\n“Do you know who it is?”\n“Word arrived late last night. A squadron from Adro has arrived carrying\ntheir special envoy with orders to find out what the pit we’re up to.”\nVlora’s heart fell further. “And who is it?” she asked again, her tone\nfirmer.\n“Delia Snowbound.”\n“Oh.” Lady Snowbound was not just a political enemy. She was one of\nthe few old nobles who’d survived Tamas’s purge. The rest of her family\nhad died before the end of the Adran-Kez War, and she was able to return to\nthe country under a general amnesty. She’d dedicated her career to\ndismantling Tamas’s legacy—overseeing general disarmament, the forced\nretirement of hundreds of officers, and even gaining leverage over the head\nof the government, Ricard Tumblar.\nIt was no stretch to assume that she’d asked to be assigned as a special\nenvoy.

You want something to\nhappen to her?”\n“Are you suggesting I order the assassination of an agent of my\ngovernment?” Vlora’s head snapped around to make sure there was no one\nwithin earshot. Even for Bo, that went over the line.\nBo shrugged. “Just asking.”\n“No. We’re not going to have her killed, as much as I’d like to.” Learn.\nBecome better. “Do you have any suggestions?”\n“Unfortunately I don’t think there’s enough money in the world to buy\nher off. She hates you more than you hate her.”\n“Any helpful suggestions?”\nShe and Bo fell into a long silence, staring anxiously at each other. This\ncould derail her entire campaign. She’d expected to face an inquisition from\nthe Adran government at some point. She had, after all, gotten deeply\ninvolved in a foreign war that her mercenary company had never been hired\nto fight.

I want to be on their side.”\nMichel was surprised to hear a note of earnestness in Ichtracia’s voice.\nHe set aside the file and looked her in the eye. She was lonely, he realized.\nHe’d found his people, but at the same time it had isolated her. They no\nlonger had the shared experience of being two fugitives on the run. He was\nfighting while she waited around to enact plans he did not share with people\nshe did not know.\n“You’re on my side,” he told her gently. “These people don’t know you.\nThey don’t trust you. Jiniel will take you in on my word, but to be honest,\nnone of these people know me, either.” He let his own unhappiness leak\nout. “I’ve been listening the last couple of days. Overhearing. Turns out I’m\na bit of a legend with these people. They watched me infiltrate the Yaret\nHousehold and think I’m some kind of wizard for engineering the downfall\nof the Blackhats. But the only one who does know me is Jiniel, and we\nhaven’t spoken for years.”\nHe continued, “These are my people, but I’m an outsider, too. You and I\nneed to stick together. Do what we can to earn their trust. But they’ve got a\nhundred different projects and missions going on. We’ll go about our own\nbusiness, using what resources they can spare. Which will be less than we\nneed, I’m sure.”\n“You don’t have faith in them?” Ichtracia asked curiously.\n“It’s not that I don’t have faith in them. It’s like… like I just said.\nThey’ve got their own missions that they think are more important. They\ndon’t mind working against the Dynize, but they think our claims about\nblood sacrifices are fairy tales.”\nIchtracia snorted angrily. “If they won’t help, then what do we do?”\n“We give them a reason to help. We find evidence.” Michel hesitated a\nmoment, thinking of compartmentalization. Against his better judgment, he\nneeded Ichtracia to trust him more than he needed to keep her in the dark.\nHe handed her the report from Emerald and waited while she read through\nit.\nShe handed it back a few minutes later. “Nothing,” she said in disgust."

No evidence of blood sacrifice. This doesn’t\nhelp!”\n“Right,” Michel agreed. “But the rest of it.”\nShe sighed. “Your setup of Meln-Dun worked.”\n“It didn’t just work. It worked amazingly well. These are actual memos\nfrom within the Dynize government.” Michel waved the report at her. “The\nYaret Household found three separate instances of Meln-Dun working with\nAdran agents over the last decade that I didn’t even know about. On their\nown, they’re just a bit of bribery and light racketeering—nothing that the\nBlackhats would have used to move against him. But taken with Dynize\nparanoia, these paint Meln-Dun as an enemy of the state.”\n“Meln-Dun is down. Mama Palo can begin to operate in the open again.\nHow does this help us?” Ichtracia was clearly frustrated.\nMichel smiled, trying to keep any sense of condescension out of his\ntone. “Because with this,” he said, “we can break Meln-Dun in the way I\nneed him broken.”\nThe now-former quarry boss was being kept in a dank little cell underneath\nGreenfire Depths. The stone down there was cold, oozing water that drained\ndown through a crack in the floor. When Michel put his hand on the slimy\nwall, he could feel the vibration of the steam pumps that kept the lower\nlevels of the Depths from flooding. They were well below the Hadshaw\nRiver here—below even the nearby ocean.\nMichel let himself into the cell, hanging his lantern on a hook in the low\nceiling and turning to face the man huddling in the corner. It had been two\ndays since his kidnapping, and Meln-Dun did not look well. He was pallid\nand shivering. His bed was a mess of damp straw barely held together by\nsomething vaguely resembling a mattress cover. All he had for his waste\nwas a bucket in one corner. By the smell of it, it hadn’t been changed since\nhe arrived.\nIchtracia had wanted to come along, but this kind of questioning was\nmost effective if Michel could work one-on-one with the prisoner. He gave\nMeln-Dun a sad smile. “I’m sorry about the lodgings.”\n“No you’re not.” Meln-Dun’s words were angry, but they had no bite.\nHe looked more pathetic than anything else—a man who didn’t take much\nto feel as if he’d been broken. Michel had to remind himself that most\npeople ended up that way. No matter how much courage a man thought he\nhad, it amounted to nothing when he’d lost everything dear to him. “What\nare you here for? To torture me?”\nMichel peered at Meln-Dun. Per his instructions, it appeared he hadn’t\nbeen touched. “You think that’s what I do?”\n“I don’t know. I can hear them talking, you know. They’re planning on\nkilling me. They hate me. They want to make sure my death lasts a long\ntime.”\nThe “they” clearly referred to the guards posted outside the cell. Michel\nwondered whether he should put a stop to that kind of talk.

If they actually\nplanned to go through with their threats, it could ruin all his hard work. If,\non the other hand, it was a bit of wishful chatter… well, that could be\nuseful. “Of course they hate you,” he said with a sigh. “You sold out their\nleader’s predecessor to Lindet, then sold yourself to the Dynize.”\n“I did what I had to.”\n“For yourself. Yes, I understand that. I’m here to talk to you about what\nelse you can do for yourself.”\nMeln-Dun studied him through distrustful eyes for several moments.\n“What do you want from me?”\n“Information.”\n“I don’t have anything of use to you.”\n“That’s for me to decide.”\nMeln-Dun’s lip curled. “I’m not going to tell you anything.”\nMichel put on a strong air of world-weariness. It wasn’t a hard act. He\nfound a dryish spot on the wall to lean against and let out a heavy sigh,\ncareful that he look as unconcerned as possible. “That’s your choice,” he\nreplied.\n“It… it is?”\n“Sure. I’m not interested in bloodying my knuckles with your face. I’m\njust here to ask a few questions.”\n“And if I don’t answer them?”\nMichel shrugged. “Not my problem.”\n“What does that mean?”\n“It means I turn around and walk out of here. Nothing changes. You stay\ndown here, shivering in the darkness, listening to the brutal fantasies of the\nguards and eating whatever slop they feed you until you catch pneumonia\nand die alone.”\nMeln-Dun’s teeth began to chatter audibly.\n“Or,” Michel continued, “you answer my questions. I leave you a light,\nget you an extra blanket and a dry mattress. Small kindnesses, you know?”\nMeln-Dun stared at him as if he were a demon crawled from the very\npit. “What’s going to happen to me?” he whispered.\n“I just painted a pretty vivid picture,” Michel replied. “I mean, they\ncould lose their patience and execute you, of course. Nice and fast. That\nwould probably be better.” Michel was careful to phrase the actions in terms\nof “them” versus “me.” Two different entities. Give the prisoner something\nhopeful to grab on to.\n“I mean if I help you.”\nMichel took a deep breath. “You’re never going to be a free, powerful\nman again, Meln-Dun. But if you help me, it gives me leverage to help you.\nBest-case scenario is that, once the war is over, you are retired to the\ncountryside with a permanent guard but some amount of comfort and\nautonomy.”\nThis best-case scenario didn’t seem to sound all that best-case to Meln-\nDun. He visibly withdrew into himself, his face twisting in horror, hands\nclutching at his knees. “You’re not going to win, you know,” he said, his\nvoice stronger. “The Dynize. They’re going to beat you.”\n“If I were you, I wouldn’t root for them.”\n“They’ll free me.” Meln-Dun raised his chin. “They’ll free me when"

All of this will be explained to them, and—”\nMichel lost his patience, tossing a careful selection of Emerald’s report\nonto Meln-Dun’s lap. “I’m guessing you can read enough Dynize to see\nwhat those say?”\nMeln-Dun slowly lifted the reports, flipping through them as he peered\nat the words.\n“Those,” Michel explained, “are internal memos regarding the traitor\nMeln-Dun.”\n“These aren’t real.”\nMichel shrugged again, as if it didn’t really matter. “I could mock those\nup, probably. Getting the grammar right might be hard unless I found a\nnative speaker willing to do some forgeries for me. I didn’t need to, though.\nWe stole those right from the capital building.”\nMeln-Dun read through the report again and then looked up sharply at\nMichel. “You set me up. Everything you told me when you woke me up the\nother day—”\n“Was all true,” Michel said with a gentle smile. “Except for the part\nabout me working for Dahre. You were set up, and the Dynize did come and\ntry to arrest you about an hour after we left. Whatever suspicions they had\n—and I gave them quite a lot to work with—were cemented when they\narrived only to find that you’d fled with all your valuables.” Michel\nscratched the back of his head. “You’re dead to them now, Meln-Dun.\nDoesn’t matter what the truth is. They think they know, and if they ever find\nyou, they will execute you without a second thought.”\nMeln-Dun stared at Michel in horror. This was, he admitted to himself, a\nform of torture. Michel produced a newspaper from his pocket and handed\nit over. “Third page. The Dynize have already taken over your quarry.\nSeveral of your foremen have been apprehended for questioning. They’re\nnot leaking any more information, of course. They want to keep the betrayal\nquiet. But they’ve quietly put a price on your head.”\n“What are your questions?” The sentence seemed to tear itself from\nMeln-Dun’s throat. Michel had finally gotten through to him.\n“Are the Dynize kidnapping Palo for their own purposes?”\nThere was a flicker in Meln-Dun’s eyes, so quick that Michel might not\nhave noticed it if he weren’t watching carefully. Recognition. Then fear.\nMeln-Dun turned away, looking at his feet. “I don’t know anything about\nthat.”\n“You’re sure?” Michel prodded gently.\n“I’m sure.” The protestation had a firm, desperate finality to it, as if\nMeln-Dun was hoping that if he exclaimed hard enough, it would put the\nmatter to rest. “What else do you want to know?”\n“I want to know about the disappearances,” Michel pushed.\nMeln-Dun suddenly surged to his feet. “I know nothing about them!” He\nstared at Michel, his whole body trembling, until he melted back onto his\nbed.

They remained\nthere in silence, the only sound that of trickling water and Meln-Dun’s\nunsteady breathing. Michel knew beyond a doubt that he’d touched\nsomething. But whatever it was—if Meln-Dun knew the truth that Michel\nfeared was behind the abductions—it was too sinister for the greedy old\nsnake to address head-on. Michel needed to give him time that he didn’t\nhave.\n“Do you know why you haven’t been tortured and killed?”\nMeln-Dun shook his head fearfully.\n“Because I’m holding the wolves at bay, Meln-Dun. Because I think\nyou’re more useful to the Palo cause alive than dead. I can convince them\nof that, but only if you point me in the right direction.” No response. Michel\nswore inwardly. “I’ll give you twenty-four hours. Give me an answer, or I’ll\nlet Mama Palo decide what to do with you.” Michel opened the door. “I’ll\nleave you the light, and the papers. Give you something to read. To think\nabout.” He closed the door behind him, nodded to the guards, and headed\nup to street level.\nIchtracia was waiting for him, sitting against the wall in an empty room\nabove the holding cells. “Anything?” she asked, getting to her feet. There\nwas an anxiety in her tone and mannerisms. She wanted to know—to be\nvindicated in her hatred of her grandfather. For some reason, that thought\ngave Michel a moment of sadness.\n“Something,” Michel replied. “Definitely something.”\n“You don’t sound like it was something.”\nMichel considered the conversation. “I think we’re on the right track. I\nthink Meln-Dun was privy to the disappearances, maybe even had a hand in\nthem.”\n“No evidence, though? He didn’t give us a trail to follow?”\n“Not yet.” Michel glanced back down toward the cells. Twenty-four\nhours. “Not yet, but he will.”\nCHAPTER 34\nS\ntyke lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling of Maetle’s infirmary,\nconsidering the thousands of hours he’d spent doing the same in the labor\ncamps outside of Landfall. He’d come up with games to pass the time—\nsorting pebbles, thought experiments, even new war hymns to sing while\nfighting. He couldn’t recall any of it now; all flushed away in the flurry of\nexcitement that followed his release. He wished he remembered. It might\nmake being confined in one corner of Etzi’s Household compound a little\neasier to bear.\nThis was by far the most helpless he’d felt since leaving the labor\ncamps. Well, second-most helpless, after his duel with Fidelis Jes. But this\nwas worse than sitting in his cabin on the Seaward. At least there he could\ngo up on deck and watch the waves. Here, however, he had to wait for days\nhiding in a tiny room in a foreign city at the mercy of a single man.\nA tiny part of his brain wished for something to go wrong; that soldiers\nwould suddenly fill the doorway, bayonets fixed, here to arrest or kill him."

There\nwere a lot of noises around the compound—children playing, Household\nmaintenance, men and women going about their trades inside the walls of\nthe Household or heading out into the city for their work. It was a busy,\nthriving place that reminded him of his earliest memories of childhood on\nthe plantation. Before the madness took his father.\nThis particular sound came from several voices, and it was getting\ncloser. He rolled to his knees and stood up, facing the door when it opened\nto reveal five figures: Etzi, Maetle, the night watchman, and Ka-poel and\nCeline. The latter two had been living out in the open in the Household for\nthe last few days. No one was looking for them, nor seemed to question\ntheir presence.\nEtzi nodded seriously at Styke. “I’m sorry to keep you cooped up like\nthis longer than expected.” He ran a hand through his hair. He looked tired,\nbut pleased. “But we’ve finally made some progress. Follow me.”\nStyke pulled on his boots, checked his knife, and followed Etzi out of\nthe infirmary. It was midafternoon and he had to shade his eyes from the\nsun, squinting to try and see any of his surroundings. Three days being\nstuck inside and his legs felt cramped, his shoulders tight. Etzi led him\ndown an immaculately kept series of gravel walks that connected and ran\nbetween the buildings of the compound until a narrow alley opened into a\ngrass courtyard. The ground here was slightly depressed so as to create a\nsort of amphitheater, and it was filled with several hundred people.\nStyke fought a moment of panic at all the Dynize faces looking at him.\nHe felt foolish, like an ape in a zoo, and had to remind himself to stand tall,\nhands clasped behind his back, his face impassive. There was surprise\nwritten on most of the faces, and they stared at him with open curiosity as\nmurmurs laced back and forth through the small crowd.\n“I’ve assembled the Household,” Etzi told him, leading him to a spot at\nthe head of the tiny amphitheater.\n“You could have warned me.”\n“Ah. I thought Maetle told you. My apologies.” Etzi scowled, giving\nStyke no time to consider the gathering. “You’ll have to excuse them.\nKressians are rare enough, but I doubt any of them have ever seen anyone\nof your size. Now then…” He lifted one hand, and the amphitheater fell\nsilent as quickly as Styke’s Lancers would responding to his orders.\n“My friends,” Etzi addressed the Household, “for the last three days, we\nhave been harboring a pair of fugitives. These fugitives were unjustly and\nillegally attacked in the same violence that ended my mother’s life.”\nWhispers of sympathy and anger tittered through the assembly. Etzi stilled\nthem with a gesture. “One of those fugitives is my brother, Ji-Orz.” Gasps\nfollowed the announcement, and the ripple of excitement was harder to"

        "text": "them with a gesture. “One of those fugitives is my brother, Ji-Orz.” Gasps\nfollowed the announcement, and the ripple of excitement was harder to\nquiet. Styke gathered from the outburst that Orz was well known. Etzi\ncontinued over it. “Orz was released and pardoned by the Great Ka in\nFatrasta. Why he was attacked, we do not know. But we will get to the\nbottom of it, even as he struggles for his life in our own infirmary.”\nMany of the crowd glanced toward Maetle, nodding and whispering as\nthey put together her mysterious sequestering with Orz’s presence.\n“Master!” someone called. “Who is the giant?”\nA flicker of a smile caught the corner of Etzi’s mouth. Instead of\nrebuking the questioner, he gestured to Styke. “This man is named Ben. He\nis a warrior from Fatrasta, and he is an ally of my brother. In fact, he saved\nOrz’s life. He will be our guest while my brother recovers from his wounds,\nand I want you all to treat him as you would a member of this Household.\nUnderstood?”\nStyke cleared his throat and eyed the group. The faces staring back at\nhim looked as normal as any group he might find in a city or town—men,\nwomen, children; tradesmen, laborers, students; even a handful of soldiers.\nIt reminded him again of the plantation when he was growing up, except\nthat on the plantation there had been a very clear divide between his family\nand all of the “help.” Here, it seemed as if everyone was family. It felt odd,\nbut not bad.\nHe spotted Celine and Ka-poel in the back corner and gave them a small\nnod. Celine waved back at him. No one seemed to notice.\nEtzi said a few more words and then dismissed the Household. He\nturned to Styke and gave him a tight smile. “The Household is open to you\nnow.”\n“And it’s wise that they know I’m here?”\n“Everyone knows you’re here,” Etzi said. “I’ve spent the last two days\nlaying the groundwork for a suit against Ka-Sedial’s agents who attacked\nyou and Orz. I took it to the Quorum Hall this morning.”\n“And you’re sure they’re not going to come here asking questions?”\n“It will take them weeks to get that far,” Etzi replied confidently. “A\nlone dragonman and a handful of foreign soldiers is a curiosity, to be sure.\nBut they care far more about the murder of my mother—a retired\nHousehold head—and they care about the overreach of the Ka. I told you,\nthings here are boiling over. No one is happy, and Sedial isn’t here in person\nto silence the debates.”\nStyke opened his mouth, but he was interrupted by the approach of a\nchild. It was a small boy, perhaps Celine’s age, with a mop of dark red hair,\na broad face, and a stout, almost chubby body. He cleared his throat loudly,\nand both Styke and Etzi looked down.\n“Sir,” the boy said, the slightest tremor in his voice. “Celine says that\nyou are the head of her Household.”\nStyke blinked back at the child, looked up toward the corner to find"

He took a step\nbehind Styke’s shoulder and said in a low voice, “One of the boys tried to\nkiss her yesterday.”\n“And I didn’t hear about this?”\n“She knocked his front teeth out. Baby teeth—he’ll grow more—but the\nchildren are scared of her now.”\nStyke cocked an eyebrow at Celine, then looked down at the boy in front\nof him. “And this one?”\n“He doesn’t scare easily. His name is Jerio. A distant cousin of mine.\nMuch more polite than the other boy. And much smarter.”\nStyke cleared his throat. “That’s up to her,” he answered in his broken\nDynize, kneeling down next to the boy and holding up one finger. “But I’d\nsuggest not making her mad.”\n“Thank you, sir!” Jerio said, turning and running toward Celine before\nthe last word had left his mouth. He reached Celine, and the two had a\nquick exchange before they both ran down one of the corridors that left the\namphitheater. Styke felt like he had just witnessed some sort of strange,\nchildlike ritual. Celine had made it clear that she could not only fend for\nherself but that her guardian was bigger than anyone else in the city. She\nwas now forging alliances. Celine, he realized, was going to be a terrifying\nteenager.\n“Sir!” someone called. This time the word was directed toward Etzi. A\nyoung man approached in a hurried walk, his face pale, and whispered\nsomething in Etzi’s ear. Etzi looked up sharply at Styke.\n“What is it?”\n“That dragonman. He’s outside.”\n“I thought you said it would be a couple of weeks before he came\ncalling.”\nEtzi swore under his breath and hurried after the young man. Styke\nfollowed, checking his knife as he went. They navigated the corridors of the\ncompound and were soon at the front gate. This was the first time Styke had\nactually seen it since carrying Orz in here three nights ago. It looked\nsmaller in the daytime, an open-air vestibule that led off in a half-dozen\ndirections. The big doors were closed and a concerned-looking soldier stood\non a raised platform that let him look over the wall. Etzi climbed up to join\nhim.\nStyke elected to remain on the ground, putting his back to the wall and\nkeeping his eye on the gate, listening.\n“Good morning, Servant of God,” Etzi said in a formal tone.\nStyke couldn’t see the dragonman, but he could imagine the\ncondescending sneer on his face. He seemed the type.\n“Open the gate,” the dragonman called. “There are traitors I must\narrest.”\n“You must be mistaken.”\n“I am not. And I am not in the mood for games.

Probably\nbecause his own brother was a dragonman. He shook his head. “You know\nthe law, Servant. Take your henchmen and be gone. The men inside this\ncompound are under the protection of myself and the Household Quorum.”\n“This doesn’t have to go badly for you.”\n“It won’t,” Etzi replied with a hard note in his voice. “I am doing my\nduty. Or do you forget what it’s like to have a mother and a brother?”\n“You’re making a mistake.”\n“If you force your way into this compound and lay a finger upon my\nbrother or his friend, the Household Quorum will turn on your master with\na fury he is not prepared to fight. Go ask him. Go speak to one of Sedial’s\npuppets and find out just how much he’s ready to risk for a single\ndragonman.”\n“It’s not just about Orz.” The dragonman had the tone of someone trying\nto be reasonable with an unruly child. “It’s about that giant.”\n“He’s also under my protection.”\n“You have no idea what kind of snake you’re dealing with.”\n“He strikes me as more of an ox,” Etzi said. “Now, go on back to one of\nyour master’s puppets. Tell him he has to wait for the law to run its course\njust like everyone else.”\nStyke heard the distinct sound of someone spitting at the base of the\ngate, then the tramp of a dozen pairs of feet receding down the causeway\nthat led away from the compound. Etzi remained on the guard post,\nwatching them go, before descending. His face was troubled. “That one is\ngoing to be trouble.”\n“You knew that,” Styke pointed out.\n“Yes, I did. What did he mean about you being a snake?”\nStyke shrugged. He wasn’t about to tell him about the army that might\nbe south of the city. “He still have that limp?”\n“Ah, yes. I forgot that it may be personal for him. However, I had the\nsense that it was more than that. Something from Sedial.”\n“I killed a few of Sedial’s dragonmen.”\n“You don’t strike me as a boastful man, Ben,” Etzi said in a manner that\nvery clearly told Styke that he didn’t believe him.\nStyke shrugged again and deflected. “Orz said that the emperor is under\nSedial’s influence.”\n“It is a… rumor.” Etzi shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other\nas if Styke had just committed some blasphemy.\n“What happens if the emperor himself orders you to open that gate and\nhand Orz and me over to the dragonman?”\n“The emperor doesn’t get involved,” Etzi said. He cleared his throat,\navoiding Styke’s eye, and turned toward the watchman at the gate. “Keep\nthis door closed at all times. No strangers in or out.” He took a deep breath\nand nodded at Styke. “Again, thank you for your patience. I have a lot to do\nto prepare for the days ahead. Feel free to get to know the compound.

If you\nwant to leave, I’ll send you with an escort. Good day.” He strode away\nbefore Styke could respond.\nThe whole exchange had been hurried, a very obvious cover-up of the\nfact he hadn’t answered Styke’s question. Styke grit his teeth, unable to do\nmuch more than that. He tried to remember Celine’s advice: Don’t attract\nattention. That’s all he needed to do until Orz recovered.\nBut he also needed to be realistic. Etzi was using him for his own ends.\nThe winds could shift at any moment and this safe haven would be\nupended. Styke needed to make sure he had his own plans in motion.\nHe hurried to catch up to Etzi, who’d already rounded a corner and was\ngiving orders to a couple of his Household members. He looked up in\nexpectation when Styke approached. “I’m sorry, Ben. I have a lot to do.”\n“Just one request: I want to visit my soldiers in prison.”\nEtzi considered this for a moment and gave a hesitant nod. “I’ll try to\narrange it.”\nCHAPTER 35\nM\nichel spent his free time integrating both himself and Ichtracia into\nMama Palo’s command structure. Ichtracia’s eagerness to belong to\nsomething came in handy, and although she kept her aloof demeanor, she\nremained omnipresent—hanging around Jiniel or her lieutenants at every\nmoment, giving insight into Dynize operations, and never hesitating to offer\na helping hand whenever it was needed.\nHer gloves remained out of sight, and her true nature was only revealed\nto a handful of Mama Palo’s inner circle, with those sworn to secrecy.\nMichel kept his ear to the ground, listening for any rumbling that the\nDynize Privileged and bone-eyes had become alerted to her flash of sorcery\nthe other day. As time went by and soldiers did not march into the Depths\nby the thousands, Michel began to relax.\nThey’d gotten lucky.\nMichel himself did much the same as Ichtracia. He was immediately\nslotted into Jiniel’s command structure just below Mama Palo herself. But\nwhile her lieutenants seemed to accept this new state of things, he could tell\nthat it was uncomfortable for them. His reputation as a maverick spy won\nhim admiration, not loyalty. As he’d told Ichtracia, he was still an outsider.\nHe’d have to work to change that.\nIn the meantime, the fact that he had a reputation gave him anxiety. A\nknown spy was a bad spy. All it took was a single informant, or even one\npair of careless lips mentioning his name at the wrong time, to bring the\nmight of Ka-Sedial down upon them. He wondered if he should change his\nidentity again and work from the shadows, or leave the city altogether.\nJiniel was about as good a leader as the Sons of the Red Hand could get:\ncompetent, intelligent, fervent.

Michel replaced the spent lamp with his own and leaned casually\nagainst the one dry spot on the wall. “You wanted to talk.”\n“You have to guarantee that they won’t torture me,” Meln-Dun croaked.\n“I’m not guaranteeing anything,” Michel replied coolly. “As I said, I’ll\ndo what I can to make your life more comfortable. But my ability to do this\ndepends completely upon how useful you can be.”\nMeln-Dun stared at him for several moments, a flurry of emotions\ncrossing his face. He barely even glanced at Ichtracia. Once again, a sliver\nof pity nearly broke into Michel’s thoughts. He steeled himself,\nremembering who Meln-Dun was and everything he’d done.\n“You want to know about the disappearances,” Meln-Dun finally said,\nlooking down at his hands.\n“I do.”\n“It was Ka-Sedial.”\nMichel glanced at Ichtracia. She was watching Meln-Dun just as intently\nas he was looking away in shame. “Go on.”\n“He came to me just after the invasion. Told me that he needed people\nthat wouldn’t be missed. Said that if I could provide him with two hundred\na week, he would make sure that my quarry remained independent, that my\npeople would be taken care of.”\nMichel had expected this. He knew the sinister implications. But hearing\nit out of Meln-Dun’s mouth made his gut twist. “So what did you do?”\n“I provided them,” Meln-Dun whispered. “Kresimir help me, I provided\nthem. Old men. Children. Drifters and dispossessed. I put a couple of my\nforemen in charge of the gathering. I didn’t want to know the details.”\n“You’re a monster.” The absolute lack of emotion in Ichtracia’s voice\ncaught Michel’s attention more than any amount of anger. Her face was a\nstone wall, but her eyes smoldered. He prepared to throw himself between\nthem if it came to that.\nMeln-Dun looked up, his lip curled. “I did this to survive.”\n“You did this to enrich yourself.”\n“And save my people! Thousands depend on me for work! Tens of\nthousands depend on my quarry and work projects for survival! Without\nme, the entire Depths is doomed!”\n“Don’t flatter yourself,” Michel said, trying to hold in his own anger. He\nneeded to remain uninterested, detached. “So you gathered up the\nunwanted. What happened to them?”\n“Like I said, I didn’t want any details.”\nMichel almost swore out loud. The testimony of a condemned man"

The testimony of a condemned man\nmight be enough evidence to convince Mama Palo and her lieutenants, but\nit wasn’t enough to galvanize the population. He needed more. “You don’t\nknow anything?”\nMeln-Dun flinched. “I know they were taken to a keelboat every night at\nabout one. A handful at a time.”\nThis was something. Michel leaned forward. “And?”\n“They shoved off downriver.”\n“Toward the bay?”\nA nod. “I don’t know what happened to them after that. I didn’t ask; I\ndidn’t want to know.”\n“Are you still making deliveries?” Ichtracia demanded.\n“No. No! I… the requests stopped. Ka-Sedial said that he had enough.”\nMichel didn’t like the look of alarm that crossed Ichtracia’s face, and he\ndidn’t stop her when she crossed the room to snatch Meln-Dun by the front\nof the shirt. Despite her size, she jerked him around to face her and shook\nhim hard. “How long ago did the deliveries end?”\n“Weeks ago! He said he didn’t need any more. I think… I think we gave\nhim a couple of thousand people in total.”\nIchtracia released Meln-Dun, dropping him and staggering away. Her\nwhole body trembled, and she fled from the room without another word.\nMichel watched her go, then turned his attention back to Meln-Dun. “Is that\nall you’ve got?”\n“It is,” he whispered. “I don’t know anything else about it. I’ll give you\nthe names of the foremen I had doing the work. I’ll give you the keelboat\nlaunch. That’s all I have, I swear.”\nMichel swallowed his disgust. Meln-Dun didn’t need to know exactly\nwhat those “unwanted” Palo would be used for to know that it wouldn’t be\npleasant. He’d sold the lives of his own countrymen and worse, those that\ncouldn’t defend themselves. There was a strong temptation to go back on\nhis word and let Mama Palo’s foot soldiers tear the bastard apart. He\nwrestled with the thought for several moments before leaving the room in\ndisgust.\n“Give him a better mattress,” Michel told the guards outside. “And a\npermanent light.” He stormed off to find Ichtracia.\nShe’d retreated to the street outside. He found her on the stoop, her\nwhole body still shaking. Michel took one of her hands gently, sitting down\nbeside her.\n“I should have seen it happening,” Ichtracia whispered. “I should have\nput a stop to it.”\n“You couldn’t have known.”\n“I should have. I was willfully ignorant.” She rubbed her face hard\nenough to turn her cheeks red. “I knew that Ka-poel—I didn’t know her\nname then, just that my grandfather had an adversary—I knew that Ka-poel\nhad somehow locked the godstone. I knew that Sedial and his Privileged\nand bone-eyes were trying to remove that lock. I just thought they\nwere…”—she gestured mysteriously—“doing magic things to solve the\nproblem.

I should have known that those magic\nthings would require blood, and lots of it.” She cradled her head in her\nhands. “And that blood should have been mine.”\nMichel frowned, trying to catch up. A slow realization entered the back\nof his head. “So if the blood of those people was being used to undo Ka-\npoel’s sorcery, and the deliveries stopped weeks ago, that means…”\n“That Sedial already managed to unlock the godstone,” Ichtracia\nfinished.\n“Shit.”\n“Yeah. Shit.”\n“If he’s had it unlocked this long, then what is he waiting for?” Michel\nasked.\nIchtracia shook her head. “He doesn’t know everything. Perhaps he’s\nbeen studying it, trying to figure out how to activate it. Or maybe he’s\nwaiting until they can get their hands on the third godstone. Or waiting until\nhe’s finished off his enemies. I don’t know, but he must have a good reason\nfor not having used it yet.”\nMichel let out a shaky breath. “This is bad.” He wished he could tell\nTaniel and Ka-poel. They needed to know. He would get the information to\nEmerald as quickly as possible, but even if the albino knew how to find\nthem, it would take weeks to reach them. “Okay, one thing at a time. This\nmakes it even more vital that we rouse the Palo. But to do that, we need\nevidence.”\n“You think anyone will care?” Ichtracia said, a note of defeat in her\nvoice.\n“About the abduction and blood sacrifice of thousands of their kin?”\nMichel finally let his anger out. He was mad, but he was not helpless. He\ncould do something to avenge these people. “Of course they’ll care. Ka-\nSedial has made a mistake.” He got to his feet.\n“Where are you going?” she asked.\n“To follow the path Meln-Dun just gave us. To find evidence. Are you\ncoming?”\nMichel got the name of the keelboat landing from Meln-Dun. He and\nIchtracia found it without a problem, near the southeastern exit of Greenfire\nDepths. There was nothing particularly unique about the landing—it was\none of dozens within the Depths. Michel examined it thoroughly, asked a\nfew of the workers about smuggling opportunities, spread around a little bit\nof money. No one reported anything out of the ordinary. Michel wasn’t\nsurprised. With many weeks since its last insidious use, these might not\neven be the same people.\nMichel hired a small, two-man canoe. Ichtracia sat in the front while\nMichel took the back, giving her a brief boating tutorial as they pushed into\nthe middle of the river.\nThere was plenty of traffic on the river, both from the Depths itself and\nfrom farther upriver, shipping supplies and soldiers back and forth from the\nbay. Michel allowed the gentle current to take them and kept his eyes on the\nrock walls of the plateau. They were soon out of the Depths and entirely\nburied within the canyon.

He watched for smugglers’ coves, outcroppings,\nlow entrances to the catacombs—any place that the Dynize might take a\nkeelboat full of old people and children.\n“They’re taking them down to the godstone south of the city, correct?”\nhe asked Ichtracia.\nShe nodded unhappily. “From what I understand, the longer the blood is\nseparated from a person, the less useful it is. The most potent use will be\ndirect from them.”\n“That’s how je Tura described it,” Michel said, shuddering at the\nmemory. “Men, women, and children, their blood being spilled directly\nonto the godstone.”\n“That sounds right.”\n“So if they kidnapped them from the Depths, loaded them into the\nkeelboat, then…”\n“They would take them south.”\n“Right.” Michel kept his eyes on the walls of the plateau, but began to\nsuspect that he’d find nothing here. Already loaded onto the keelboat, it\nwould be easiest to take the prisoners out through the bay and down the\ncoast a couple of miles. “There’s a barge landing on the coastal plain near\nthe godstone. I’d be willing to bet that’s where they’re unloaded.”\nThey continued down the river in silence, dodging keelboats and river\nbarges, letting the current take them out into the bay, where they canoed\npast the big Dynize ships laying in anchor. It was a calm day, the ocean like\na sheet of glass, so they proceeded out past the breakers and turned south to\nhug the coast. They were not alone, either—plenty of traffic moved up and\ndown the coast, making them just one of hundreds of boats, ships, barges,\nand canoes.\nOnce they were out of the harbor, the stink of dead fish and city sewage\ndissipated, and Michel found himself breathing the ocean air in deeply. He\nwondered why he didn’t do this more often, then remembered that he’d\nbeen an active informant for most of his adult life, which left very little\nroom for innocent pleasures.\n“You act like you’ve done this before,” Ichtracia said.\nThey were the first words spoken in almost an hour, and Michel\nreluctantly brought his mind back from its pleasant trance. “When I was a\nkid,” he said, “I used to steal a canoe after the really bad storms and paddle\nup and down the shoreline looking for anything washed up from\nshipwrecks.”\n“Isn’t that… dangerous?”\n“Wildly. But you can see more when you’re out on the water. Trick is to\nstay close enough to land that you don’t get swept away, but far enough that\nyou don’t get bashed against the rocks. A day like today? An absolute\nbreeze.” Michel continued to paddle with long, even strokes, propelling\nthem through the calm water. His arms were beginning to hurt, but he didn’t\nmind.\nThe shoreline was his main concern. Much of it was marshy scrubland,\nproviding a barrier between the ocean and the plains beyond—the same\nkind of horrid swamp that Lindet’s forced labor camps had spent the last ten\nyears trying to irrigate around the plateau.

This was broken by the\noccasional rocky outcropping and, even less often, a gentle sandbar big\nenough to constitute an actual beach.\n“Should I be looking for anything in particular?” Ichtracia asked.\nMichel shook his head slowly. “I’m not even sure myself. Things out of\nthe ordinary, maybe?”\n“I don’t know what constitutes ordinary on a coast like this.”\nMichel didn’t answer. He was beginning to suspect that he’d taken this\nexpedition as a way to get out of the city more than anything else. What did\nhe hope to find out here? A trail, like he’d said, but the most likely trail led\nright to the barge landing that he could now see about a mile to their south.\nNot too much longer and they’d have to turn back. That landing was likely\nheavily guarded. He didn’t want to risk talking his way past those guards,\nnot with Ichtracia in tow.\nThey proceeded another half mile before he dug in his paddle and turned\nthem around, heading back north. The pleasant feeling was gone now,\nreplaced by frustration. Had he just wasted an entire afternoon paddling up\nand down the coast? His mood began to sink further, and he was just\nbeginning to lose his concentration when Ichtracia spoke up.\n“You see something in those rocks there?”\nHe followed her outstretched finger toward one of the rocky\noutcroppings. There was nothing out of the ordinary about this one—it had\na small gravel beach at its base, upon which the trunk of one of those giant\ntrees from up north had washed. As a child he used to love those giant\ntrunks. He would climb all over them, inspect their roots for caught\ntreasures, and pretend they were his mighty ship run ashore.\n“Nothing,” Michel answered her.\n“There’s a kid hiding behind the roots.”\nMichel watched carefully for several minutes. Finally, he saw a little\nflash of color and a movement. “Okay, I see it. Two kids, looks like.” He\npulled in his paddle, letting them drift, and considered their options. They’d\nseen relatively few people along the shore between here and Landfall. It\nwould be smart to walk all the way back, question everyone as they went,\nbut those long stretches of marsh made such an endeavor difficult.\n“They’re awfully far from the nearest fishing village,” Michel said,\nlooking up and down the coast. They were, it seemed, trapped on that\noutcropping by the marsh. “They might be local, though. We can go ask if\nthey’ve seen anything out of the ordinary.”\nHe turned the canoe toward shore. By the time they reached it, both of\nthe children had disappeared. Michel looked around the empty little beach\nand up toward the rocks, hesitant to go looking through that tangle. He\npushed the canoe farther onto the beach. “Stay here,” he told Ichtracia. “I\ndon’t want a couple of damned kids getting the drop on us and stealing our\ncanoe.”\n“They’d do that?”\n“It’s what I would have done for fun at that age,” he said over his\nshoulder. He headed up the beach, around the ocean-worn tree trunk, and"

He headed up the beach, around the ocean-worn tree trunk, and\nbegan to climb the rocks. He got to the top and looked around. They were,\nindeed, trapped on the outcropping, surrounded by marsh. He couldn’t see\nany kids, and he couldn’t see any likely path that they would have taken to\nget here.\nHe could see the godstone from here. It was a couple of miles away,\nrising from the plain like a twig thrust into a sandbar. Around it swarmed a\nsmall city, constructed entirely by the Dynize since they arrived. There were\nlaborers, soldiers, scientists, Privileged, and bone-eyes. The walls of a\nmighty fortress, as of yet unfinished and covered in scaffolding, surrounded\nthe monolith itself.\nThe very idea that that thing was active and usable, bathed in the blood\nof thousands, made him want to look away—to spill the content of his\nstomach into the rocks. He wasn’t sure whether it was the sorcery of the\nstone or just his own horrible knowledge, but the whole horizon seemed to\npulse with dark purpose. He shuddered and turned back toward the beach.\nOnly to come face-to-face with an old Palo man, bent and gray.\nMichel almost tumbled from his perch in surprise. The old man held a\ndriftwood branch over his head, as if preparing to swing. His clothes were\ntorn and weather-beaten, his beard and hair unkempt and unwashed. He\nseemed as surprised that Michel had turned around as Michel was that he\nwas there, making a oop noise.\n“Were you just about to hit me with that?” Michel demanded.\nThe old man brandished the stick. “Give us your canoe,” he said.\nMichel eyeballed the makeshift weapon. The old man’s arms trembled\nso hard that it almost fell from his hands just hanging there, and he doubted\nit could be swung with any strength. Michel raised one hand toward the old\nman and another toward the beach, where Ichtracia could no doubt see that\nsomething was happening. He didn’t want her to do anything rash, not out\nin the open like this.\n“Whoa there,” Michel said gently. “Hey old-timer, can I help you with\nsomething?”\n“You can give us your canoe.” Despite his trembling limbs, the man’s\nvoice was strong.\n“So you can go where?” Michel asked. “It doesn’t look like you’re fit\nfor rowing anything.”\nThe old man tried to brandish the stick again, but finally let out a\ndefeated sigh and let the weapon slip from his fingers. Michel gave him\nanother quick appraisal. He was whip-thin, the gauntness of his face\nspeaking of malnutrition. Michel wondered how long he’d been out here.\nWas he a hermit? A shipwrecked sailor? Did he have something to do with\nthe godstone? It was the final thought that sharpened Michel’s curiosity.\n“Who is ‘we’?” Michel asked.\nThe old man wilted to the ground. “No one,” he said, waving Michel off.\n“Just me.

Michel took a cautious look\naround, remembering the small figures he’d seen from the water. Two\nchildren. Alone, he had just written them off as local kids playing on the\nshore, much as he would have when he was a child. But with this old\nman… “Do you need help?”\nThe old man didn’t look up.\nMichel continued, “If you need help getting back to Landfall, I don’t\nmind rowing you to the city. But I’m not gonna let you strand me and my\nfriend here.” He tried to read the old man, to get a feel for who and what he\nwas. Mad? He didn’t seem mad. Just half-starved. “Look, I’ll make you a\ndeal. I’m trying to find out if there’s anything strange about that new citadel\nover there. You help me…” He trailed off, because when he gestured\ntoward the godstone, the old man flinched. Not a small flinch, either. He\nmight as well have cowered. Michel’s breath caught in his throat.\nAn elderly Palo man and a couple of children. The unwanted, the\nuncared-for.\nMichel crouched down, staring intently at the old man. “Do you know\nsomething about that place?”\n“No,” the old man growled. “Nothing. Now, go.”\nIt was an obvious lie. Michel continued on in a gentle, firm voice. “How\nlong have you been here?”\nNo answer.\n“Are you from Greenfire Depths?”\nStill no answer.\nMichel looked around for any sign of the kids. He thought he saw a bit\nof red hair poking up behind a nearby rock. It moved. He didn’t give any\nindication that he’d seen it, keeping one eye on the man and one on the\nrocks. “I’m from the Depths. I’m trying to find out about people who went\nmissing there. I think some of them were taken to the new Dynize citadel.”\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” The old man was a terrible\nliar. He was also clearly terrified. Michel caught sight of a tattoo on his\nwrinkled skin: the roots of a cypress tree on his upper arm. Michel knew the\nmark—it belonged to a large contingent of Palo soldiers who’d fought for\nFatrastan independence.\nMichel pursed his lips and spoke in a strong, confident tone. “I am a Son\nof the Red Hand, and you have no need to fear me, brother.”\nThe old man looked up sharply. His whole body convulsed and\nshuddered, and he suddenly sprang forward. Michel caught him in surprise,\nand soon found himself holding an old man who wept against his shoulder.\n“A friend!” the old man cried. “By my life, a friend!”\nIt took some time to calm the old man. The children were coaxed from\ntheir hiding spot—three of them, all looking as ragged as the old man, but\nnone nearly as starved. They gathered around Michel, touching his clothes\nand his hair.

They clapped and\nlaughed, and asked when they could go home.\nMichel struggled to maintain his professionalism. He would get them\nback to the Depths, of course. But he had to know their story. He prodded\nthe old man twice before it all came pouring out in short, staccato bursts.\n“Soldiers gathered us up. At least, I think they were soldiers. Armed\nPalo, carrying Dynize muskets. I was pulled from my tenement late at night,\nthreatened into silence. They took us to the docks. Old people, like me.\nKids. So many kids.” The old man spoke between deep breaths, every\nmoment threatening to burst into tears again. “Keelboats. Down the river.\nDown the coast. Marched us to the citadel. To that… thing. The Dynize,\nonce they had us, kept us placid with talk of food. Spoke of service to a\nhigher cause. Religion. Gods. I didn’t understand any of it. I’ve heard\npromises before, you see.” He tapped the tattoo on his arm. “I snuck off\nwhen I could. Got lost. Then I saw them… the bodies. It was the smell that\ngot me first, and then the sight. Within the citadel. A mass grave. Bloodless\ncorpses.”\nThe man began to shake and shudder. Michel put a hand on his shoulder\nto calm him. Several more minutes passed before he could speak again.\n“I saw them bloodlet a child. A child, damn it! Slit her little throat like\nshe was an animal to put in the stew, then dashed her brains against the base\nof the monolith. I fled. Managed to gather these three. I don’t think anyone\neven noticed. There were so many of us, and the night was dark and the\nsoldiers sleepy. We left through a drainage ditch in the citadel wall. But…\nbut I got lost in the dark. Led them across the marsh. It wasn’t until\nmorning that I realized I’d trapped us on this forsaken rock.”\n“Why didn’t you head back to the city?” Michel asked.\n“Fear,” the old man replied unashamedly. “Fear of the snakes and the\nbottomless marsh. Fear of the Dynize. Fear that we’d be rounded up the\nmoment we returned.”\n“How long have you been here?”\nThe old man looked at the oldest of the children, who held up one hand,\nfingers splayed.\n“Five weeks. We survived off fish we caught with our hands. There’s a\nlittle cave down under these rocks. Big enough to keep us out of the rain\nand sun.”\nMichel looked around the group. He didn’t let himself react to this story.\nHe couldn’t afford to. He had to harden himself. This was a horror, but he\nhad a job to do. He looked toward the beach, wondering how long he’d\nbeen gone, only to find Ichtracia standing less than ten paces from them.\nThe fury on her face told him that she’d heard enough. He took a long,\ncalming breath and turned back to the old man.\n“Do you still have any fight in you?”"

He took a long,\ncalming breath and turned back to the old man.\n“Do you still have any fight in you?”\nThe old man looked down at his own trembling hands. This time, there\nwas shame in his eyes.\n“Not that kind of fighting,” Michel said reassuringly. “A different kind. I\nwant you to come back to the Depths with me. Meet Mama Palo. Tell your\nstory.”\n“To who?”\n“To everyone.”\nCHAPTER 36\nV\nlora watched an approaching column with no small amount of\ntrepidation, knowing that if she’d still had her sorcery, she could spend this\ntime closely studying the faces of the men and women, gaining an early\nedge on her political enemies. Instead, she was left to stew in her\nimpatience, while her mood grew darker with every passing moment.\nHer army had stopped for the night, and she could smell the smoke from\nfires as company cooks began to turn rations into something vaguely\nresembling dinner. She’d been told she would enjoy venison herself—a bit\nof meat shot by one of the camp followers and sold to the general-staff chef.\nShe doubted she would actually enjoy it. Everything seemed to taste of ash\nthese days, even after her recent realizations.\nOne of her first duties as a commanding officer receiving politicians was\nto invite them to dinner. Vlora had no intention of doing so, and decided she\nwould have to get her pleasure from the petty snub.\n“That’s almost two thousand soldiers,” Bo said. Nila was off aiding the\nwounded, but Bo had elected to join Vlora. General Sabastenien was here as\nwell. No one else had bothered. Delia Snowbound was not popular among\nany of the soldiery, and less so among the senior officers. Even under the\nbest of circumstances Vlora herself had trouble dealing with Delia without\nlosing her temper. It was not even close to the best of circumstances.\n“The High Provosts,” Vlora spat. Even at this distance she recognized\nthe flags flying above the infantry column. One of them was the classic\ncrimson with the mountains and teardrop. The one below it was small but\nno less bold—a contrasting military blue with the same exact emblem, but\nan added chevron below the teardrop. The High Provosts were a wing of the\nmilitary police created after the Adran-Kez War as a sort of royal guard for\nthe new ministerial government. Delia Snowbound and her allies had\nmanaged to gain control of the High Provosts and turn them into a check on\nthe military leadership of the country. It had been the High Provosts who\noversaw the disbanding of much of the Adran Army.\nDelia herself was insult enough. But the presence of two thousand High\nProvosts was a slap to Vlora’s face and a clear statement of Delia’s\nintentions—she wasn’t just here to make sure that Vlora played nice in a\nforeign war. She was here to remove Vlora from power.\nVlora couldn’t let Delia get the better of her. Not now. She had to remain\ncalm.\nBo glanced in her direction and did a double take. “Are you okay?”\n“I’m practicing a pleasant smile,” Vlora told him."

Try total neutrality.”\nVlora rubbed at her jaw, trying to work some of the tension out of it.\n“How about now?”\n“You look constipated.”\n“Sabastenien?” She turned to her general.\nSabastenien cleared his throat, seemed about to say something, then\nthink better of it.\n“He agrees with me,” Bo said confidently. “Just relax. This won’t be that\nbad.”\n“Two thousand High Provosts and Delia Snowbound. How could it\npossibly be worse?”\n“Four thousand High Provosts?” Sabastenien suggested.\n“You’re not helping.” Vlora leaned back in her saddle, attempting to\nloosen the knot between her shoulders. The column continued their\napproach, and she noticed that hundreds of her soldiers had turned out to\nthe edge of camp to watch. She had a pang of fear. High Provosts were paid\nbetter than the regular army, and their numbers had been heavily recruited\nfrom the surviving scions of the old noble families who’d been\nexterminated by Tamas and their sympathizers. She worried that she\nwouldn’t have to do or say a damned thing for her soldiers to turn on the\nprovosts.\nAnything they did on their own initiative would reflect poorly on her.\nThe column finally reached the edge of camp and came to a stop. A\nsmall group detached itself from the main body and rode up the hill toward\nVlora. She recognized both Delia and the man at her side. Delia was a tall,\nslim woman with hawkish features and an overbearing air, her nose turned\nup and her lips fixed in something close to a permanent sneer. Her long\nblond hair trailed all the way down across her horse’s back. She wore a\nriding jacket and pants as if she’d turned out for a fox hunt rather than to\njoin a military expedition.\nThe man’s name was Valeer, and what he lacked in height—being only\nan inch or two taller than Vlora herself—he made up for in arrogance. He’d\ninherited the High Provosts from their original commander and done his\nvery best to turn them into Delia’s private little army. He wore the blue-and-\ncrimson uniform of a High Provost, with an epaulet on his left shoulder.\nThe pair looked every bit the part of the old aristocracy, and the\npresentation was, Vlora understood, absolutely deliberate.\n“Provost Marshal Valeer,” Vlora called as the two approached. “To what\ndo we owe the honor?”\nNeither of them answered until they’d ridden up close to Vlora and her\ncompanions. Valeer eyeballed both Bo and Sabastenien before turning to\nVlora. “A military crisis,” he said.\n“Lady Flint,” Delia greeted with a nod.\nVlora ignored the clear implication from Valeer and returned Delia’s\nnod. “Lady Snowbound. What an auspicious visit.”\nDelia looked around. “You had warning of our arrival?”\n“We did.”\n“Then where is the rest of the general staff?”\n“Having dinner, I believe.”"

Her voice cracked. Beside her, Bo cleared\nhis throat. “Pardon me,” Vlora continued, pressing a hand to her chest and\ncoughing. “I mean to say, I’d rather not interrupt anyone’s dinner. They are\ndining with their troops tonight.”\n“I see.” Delia cast a long look at Bo. He smiled back at her.\n“Lady Snowbound, is there something I can do for you?” Vlora asked in\nher most neutral tone. Even to her it sounded defensive. “We only found out\nabout your impending arrival yesterday morning and—”\n“Lady Flint,” Delia cut her off. “Marshal Valeer and I have come to\nrelieve you of your command. I would rather have told you the news\nformally, in front of the general staff, but there you have it.”\n“In front of witnesses, you mean?” Vlora asked lightly.\nDelia ignored her. “We’ve been instructed to send you, Magus Borbador,\nand Privileged Nila back to Adro to answer to the governing council. They\nturned a blind eye to your brigade of mercenaries, but you are still a sitting\nmember of the Adran Republic Cabal and an Adran general, and the fact\nthat you’re now leading a field army across a foreign continent puts our\nentire web of international relationships in peril. Once you are gone, Valeer\nand I will remain behind and attempt to sort out this war that you and\nBorbador seem to have thrown us into.”\nVlora leaned forward onto her saddle horn and frowned at Delia. The\nsilence stretched into nearly a minute, and Valeer was the first one to break\nit, shifting uncomfortably in his saddle. “Did you hear her?” he asked.\n“You’ve been relieved of your post, effective immediately. You should\ngather your general staff to pass on the news and formalize the changing of\ncommand.”\n“That’s not happening,” Vlora said.\n“Pardon?” Delia looked taken aback.\nVlora made a show of checking her pockets, then removed a small book\nfrom one of them. She’d borrowed it from the Riflejack military attorney.\nShe licked one finger and flipped through the book, then ran the tip of that\nfinger along the page to a sentence that had already been underlined for her.\nShe quoted, “Under extraordinary circumstances, and in possession of\nindividual knowledge that affects the well-being of the motherland, a\nranking general may operate his or her army in foreign territory\nindependent of orders from Adopest.”\nDelia sneered. “You believe that you can invoke Tamas’s Clause. At\nme?”\nIt took Valeer a moment to catch up, but eventually his eyes widened.\n“That clause was written during the Gurlish Wars to give Field Marshal\nTamas leave to operate without waiting for orders that might take months to\narrive.”\n“The clause is still very much on the books,” Vlora assured him.\n“And you think it applies to this circumstance?”\n“Absolutely,” Vlora replied confidently. “These are extraordinary\ncircumstances, and I possess individual knowledge that affects the well-"

        "text": "“And you think it applies to this circumstance?”\n“Absolutely,” Vlora replied confidently. “These are extraordinary\ncircumstances, and I possess individual knowledge that affects the well-\nbeing of the motherland.” She shrugged. “I’m afraid that since you must\nhave left Adopest between six and eight weeks ago, you couldn’t possibly\nknow about those extraordinary circumstances. Therefore, I can override\nyour request to hand over command of this army.”\n“It was not a request,” Valeer barked. “It was an order from your\ngovernment!”\n“Speak that way to Lady Flint again and I’ll slap that mustache off your\nface,” Sabastenien said coolly.\nBoth Vlora and Delia held up a hand in a mirror gesture to silence their\nsubordinates. It almost made Vlora laugh. “An ill-informed government,”\nshe assured them.\n“Tamas’s Clause does not allow you to act with impunity,” Delia\nwarned.\n“No, of course not,” Vlora replied. “I would never dream of it.\nAccordingly, I will order a briefing drawn up for you and Valeer. It should\nbe ready tomorrow. Once you know everything that I know, I’m sure you’ll\nagree that these circumstances are extraordinary and you will take your\nprovosts and return to Adro.”\nThat last bit was, Vlora knew, wishful thinking. But she couldn’t help\nbut try to steer them that way. Delia’s nostrils flared and her horse pranced\nto one side, as if sensing its rider’s anger. She spoke through clenched teeth.\n“We have the authority to take your command.”\n“And I have the authority to tell you to buzz off,” Vlora replied. “Don’t\nthink I mistook your intentions, showing up with two thousand provosts.\nYou may hate me because of who my father was, but you can’t possibly\nthink me a fool. I have no intention of risking my legacy on an\nunsanctioned foreign invasion—I will be vindicated in my actions.”\nDelia snorted and turned her horse away. “Prepare your briefing,” she\nsnapped over her shoulder as she began to ride back to her provosts. “We\nshall be the judge of this.”\nVlora felt herself once again missing Olem as she looked over a hastily-\ndrawn-up briefing titled “The Dynize-Fatrasta Conflict.” Normally, Olem\nwould handle this sort of thing and she trusted him so implicitly that she\nwouldn’t even have felt the need to read the draft. That sense of loneliness\ncut deep every time, refusing to go away until she consciously pushed it\naside. She had no more time for self-pity. There was too much riding on her\nability to think clearly.\nShe read through the briefing for a fourth and fifth time, adjusting the\nlanguage here and there in light pencil. She finally called for a secretary to\ntake it to be read over by a handful of her Riflejack officers. Instead of a\nsecretary, it was Bo who popped inside.\nHe took the draft out of her hand without a word and dropped onto her\ncot, reading through it quickly. “This looks good,” he finally said, handing\nit back. “I would change ‘threat to Adran interests in the region’ to ‘Adran\ninterests worldwide.’ A new god would, after all, be a worldwide threat.”"

Yes, that I have. Not a very good lot unfortunately. Delia\nspecifically made sure that most of the High Provosts she brought with her\nhave good reason to hate me.”\n“She has always been annoyingly thorough.”\n“Indeed. I was able to bribe a lieutenant.”\n“Get anything good out of him?”\n“Her,” Bo corrected. “But yes, a few interesting tidbits. It turns out that\nwhen Delia began to put together her expedition, she was absolutely\nconvinced that I had just left to invade Fatrasta.”\n“What did you tell everyone?”\n“‘Cabal business.’” Bo shrugged.\n“You got forty thousand soldiers into a fleet on ‘Cabal business’?”\n“It’s easier than it sounds when you do it in little chunks. Only the\ngenerals actually knew what we were doing. The rest of the soldiers all\nthought they were going on small, isolated missions. They didn’t find out\nuntil they reached a rendezvous well off the coast.”\n“You say that like it isn’t a terrifying feat of subterfuge.”\n“It took some planning,” Bo admitted. “I’m honestly surprised we left\nwithout a major inquest by the First Minister.”\n“Well, they’ve caught up with you.”\n“Right! About that—so, they thought I was leaving to invade Fatrasta.\nHowever, they found out about the Dynize invasion just before they left and\ndidn’t really get any new information until they reached our fleet a few days\nago. They thought they were coming to arrest a rogue group of generals and\na couple of Privileged—those provosts include half a dozen mage breakers\namong their number. Instead, they find out that I’ve handed command to\nyou and that no one is planning any sort of foreign invasion. Everyone in\nthe fleet, and indeed our own general staff, considers this a peacekeeping\nmission.”\nVlora frowned, feeling a tiny thread of optimism. “Are you saying we\nmight be able to convince Delia that we’re in the right?”\n“I’m saying that Delia is going to spend the next few days rethinking her\nposition. She didn’t actually know you’d be here until she met with our fleet\ncommanders. Seems to have thrown her off a bit. Quoting Tamas’s Clause\nat her has her in an absolute fury. I have no doubt she’s going to figure out\nhow best to make your life miserable—but I’m fairly confident you can\nkeep your command without going into open rebellion against the Adran\ngovernment.”\n“And if that happens?” Vlora asked.\nBo crossed his legs and tapped absently on his prosthetic. “Let’s not get\nahead of ourselves. I break a lot of rules because I can get away with it, but\nI’d really rather not get involved with actual treason. I imagine most of the\ngeneral staff feels the same way.”"

I imagine most of the\ngeneral staff feels the same way.”\n“So, no treason,” Vlora mused. “I’ll keep that in mind.” She took a few\ndeep breaths. Delia had arrived and Vlora still had her command. One step\nat a time. But she had to remain vigilant. Delia hated her, Bo, and every\nother officer and soldier who’d helped with Tamas’s coup ten years ago.\nShe wasn’t going to give up simply because of a clause named after the\nvery man who had executed her family.\nCHAPTER 37\nS\ntyke sat in the corner of the courtyard of Etzi’s Household compound,\ntucked in the shade while he whittled horses out of Cypress wood and\nwatched Celine play in the shallow bowl of the amphitheater. It was early\nafternoon, and the heat had already made him sweat through his shirt. All\naround him the Household carried on its duties; washerwomen, cleaners,\nand gardeners passed through the courtyard regularly. It had been two days\nsince Styke had been introduced, and they still glanced at him furtively\nevery time they came near.\nThe children seemed less bothered by his presence. Jerio, Celine’s quiet,\nserious, chubby little friend, had taken to stealing pastries from the kitchens\nevery morning and bringing them to Styke. It was not a subtle gesture—\nvery clearly meant to win Styke’s favor—and it was working well. Any boy\nclever enough to keep Celine’s attention was a good kid in Styke’s mind.\nThe pastries didn’t hurt.\nHe finished whittling a horse and blew the dust off his fingers, then set it\ndown with a half-dozen others. He’d already distributed one to each of the\nchildren in the compound, but this group was being saved for something\nspecial.\nHe adjusted each of the horses so that they stood in a perfect line on the\nflagstone, then raised his eyes to check on Ka-poel. Unlike Celine, she\nhadn’t taken to the Household. The language barrier saw to that. She spent\nher time shadowing Styke, watching people come and go, and fiddling with\nlittle bobs and bits that she kept concealed in her lap. Knowing a little how\nher sorcery worked, he wondered if she was gathering leverage over the\nHousehold or simply taking stock of what she’d already gathered. She\ndidn’t bother to tell him.\nEtzi had very pointedly not told his Household that she was a bone-eye.\nHe’d told them nothing about her, as far as Styke could discover, beyond\nthe fact that she was a guest and was to be treated as such. Even her\nconnection with Styke was not explicit, though the Household must have\npicked up on it at some point.\nHe left her to her devices and turned his head at the steady sound of\napproaching footsteps. A few moments later, Etzi emerged from a corridor,\nwalking unhurriedly but businesslike toward Styke. It was the first time\nsince Styke’s introduction to the Household that he’d even seen the\nHousehold head. Whether Etzi was avoiding him or just busy, Styke\ncouldn’t say.\nThey exchanged a cool nod, and Styke climbed to his feet and dusted off"

Whether Etzi was avoiding him or just busy, Styke\ncouldn’t say.\nThey exchanged a cool nod, and Styke climbed to his feet and dusted off\nhis trousers. “Afternoon.”\n“Good afternoon, Ben,” Etzi said with a friendly but tired smile. “I\napologize for my scarcity—this suit has taken up every second of my time\nthe last few days.”\n“Of course,” Styke said, resisting the urge to demand an update. He was\nstill trying to follow Celine’s rules for going unnoticed, and one of them\nwas simply not acting like himself. He needed to be polite. Gracious.\n“I do have news, both good and bad,” Etzi said. “The bad news is that I\nhaven’t been able to get your men released into my care.”\nStyke wasn’t surprised. “And the good?”\n“You have permission to speak with them. I have an hour of spare time\nright now, and a carriage waiting. It’ll go easier if I accompany you.”\n“Excellent.” Styke forced himself to smile. He needed an opportunity to\nput his own plans in motion, and although Etzi might be a better chaperone\nthan an escort of prison guards, he also spoke flawless Adran—which\nmeant he could overhear whatever Styke said to his men. “I would\nappreciate it. Celine!” he called, then gestured at the horses he’d been\ncarving. Celine paused in her play to nod. He then exchanged a glance with\nKa-poel. “Let’s go,” he told Etzi.\nThe carriage was not ideal. It was small and narrow, with two seats\nfacing each other in a covered box and a driver out front directing a single\nhorse. The wheels squealed loudly beneath Styke’s weight, and he could tell\nby the nonplussed expression on Etzi’s face that such a sound was not\ncommon. They rode in silence for a couple of minutes before Etzi gave him\nan embarrassed smile.\n“I’ll get a larger carriage next time,” he promised. “It’s easy to forget\njust how big you really are.”\nStyke hunched his shoulders to keep them from splitting through the thin\nwooden walls, and resisted the urge to get out and walk. “Don’t mention it.”\n“It’s better this way,” Etzi went on. “You’re the buzz of town right now,\nand even on foot you’re likely to draw crowds.”\nStyke leaned forward to look out the narrow window, watching the\npeople pass. Occasionally someone spotted his face and exclaimed to a\ncompanion, pointing, but by the time they’d made a ruckus, the carriage had\nlong passed.\n“You’ll be pleased to know that I was able to retrieve your men’s horses\nfrom the foreigner’s inn where they’d been lodged,” Etzi said.\nStyke perked up. “Yes, I am. Thank you for that. And…”\n“And that strange armor, yes, I’ve retrieved that, too.” Etzi got a peculiar\nlook on his face. He reached beneath his seat and drew out a bundle.\n“You’re lucky the innkeep didn’t take too close a look at those saddlebags,\nelse that armor would have disappeared by the end of the first day. Magical\narmor.” The last two words were more of a mutter than anything else, and"

        "text": "else that armor would have disappeared by the end of the first day. Magical\narmor.” The last two words were more of a mutter than anything else, and\nhe pinched the bundle by one corner and held it up in the small space\nbetween them, letting it unfurl. It was the skull-and-lance of the Mad\nLancers. Probably came right from Jackal’s saddlebags.\n“Company standard,” Styke explained. That peculiar look was beginning\nto bother him.\n“Yes, so I gathered. Very striking. Striking enough that it caught my\nmemory.” Etzi reached beneath the seat again and drew out a book—very\nnice, leatherbound, if rather worn. Styke recognized the stitched title down\nthe side: A History of the Fatrastan Revolution. They’d only gotten books\noccasionally in the labor camps, but this one was hard to miss. It was\nwritten four years after the end of the Revolution and had become a best\nseller overnight.\nStyke clenched his teeth while Etzi flipped to an earmarked page.\n“Our spies have smuggled us many books over the last few years,” Etzi\nexplained. “The heads of larger Households get the pick of them, of course,\nbut a few trickled down to me. It says here that this is the standard of the\nMad Lancers. There’s even a sketch, which is what caught my memory.”\nEtzi turned the book to show Styke a rendering of the flag that was lying\nacross Etzi’s lap.\nEtzi closed the book, set it on the seat beside him, then carefully folded\nthe flag back up. Styke remained silent throughout the process. When he\nwas done, Etzi said, “The odd thing to me was that Colonel Ben Styke, an\napparently infamous hero of that war, was executed for treason. The Mad\nLancers were disbanded. Odder still, a cavalry unit under this banner was\nseen at the Dynize capture of Landfall. Fighting for the Fatrastans.”\nStyke stared at the banner for a few moments, considering. His position\nwas fraught, and he’d never been a good liar. What was it that Markus had\nonce told him? The easiest way to lie is to tell a half-truth? To steer the\nconversation? “Ben Styke wasn’t executed,” he finally said. “He was put up\nagainst a wall and shot.”\n“That sounds an awful lot like an execution.”\nStyke tapped the still-visible scar on the side of his jaw, then the one on\nthe back of his hand. “Not if you’re more stubborn than a dozen bullets.”\n“I see.” Etzi opened the book again, flipping through it seemingly at\nrandom. “This Ben Styke was a giant of a man, a monster and a hero. A god\namong men, if the author is to be believed.”\n“There are a few exaggerations.”\n“The one about killing a Kez Warden with your bare hands?”\nStyke did not fail to notice that Etzi had switched from “he” to “you.”\nHe grimaced. “I was a lot younger then.”\n“You know, when you said that you’ve killed dragonmen, I assumed it a\nboast. Perhaps, I thought, you finished one on the battlefield. But the man\ndescribed in this little chapter here—this tall tale—would be more than\ncapable of fighting one of our emperor’s holy warriors.”"

But the man\ndescribed in this little chapter here—this tall tale—would be more than\ncapable of fighting one of our emperor’s holy warriors.”\nStyke cleared his throat and looked out the window. If Etzi knew who he\nwas, and knew that Styke fought for the Fatrastans, it made both their\npositions weaker. It made Styke’s position downright dangerous.\n“I don’t want to know,” Etzi said.\n“Eh?” Styke looked up at his host sharply.\n“I don’t want to know,” Etzi repeated. “I don’t want to know why you’re\nhere. I don’t want to know whose side you’re on, or what you intend to do\nin my country. I don’t believe you’re a spy, and if you’re part of an invasion\nforce, your presence here on your own is testament that it has failed\nspectacularly.”\nHe continued, “Ignorance, as they say, is bliss. I’ve begun a legal battle\nthat I cannot—that I will not—stop, and you and Orz are the linchpins. All\nthis”—he gestured at the book and the folded battle standard—“will remain\nhidden. No need to let it out, as long as both you and your men remain\nsilent. All you need is a few weeks for Orz to recover enough to walk. Then\nyou’ll be out of my hands, and whatever comes out, I can claim ignorance.”\nStyke decided not to tell him just how close his guess was. “You’re\ntaking a great risk.”\n“Revenge isn’t sweet without risk,” Etzi said with a cold smile that\nreminded Styke of Orz. “My greatest hope is to have Ji-Patten executed for\nthe murder of my mother. But at the very least, I will have given Ka-Sedial\na handful of sleepless nights.”\n“That doesn’t seem worth it,” Styke observed.\n“It takes a lot of work to make the Great Ka lose sleep.”\nTheir conversation was cut short by the carriage lurching to a stop. Etzi\nleaned forward and looked out the window. “We’re here,” he announced. A\nmoment later the driver opened the door for them, and Styke followed Etzi\nout into the sunlight.\nStyke found himself in a walled courtyard of rough-cut red stone. The\ncourtyard was large enough to accommodate a dozen carriages like theirs,\nand was about half full. The traffic continued around them, citizens coming\nand going, and more than a few stopping to stare at Styke. Etzi ignored\nthem, so Styke followed suit, continuing after his host across the dusty\ndrive and up a wide set of stairs. They proceeded down a high-arched\ncorridor and then a side hall toward a suite of offices.\nDespite the archaic look of the building—it was more ancient castle than\nthe rest of the construction in the city—it had a very modern feel to it that\nreminded him of the prisons in Fatrasta. The hallways bustled with activity,\ncity guardsmen marching here and there, long-coated investigators speaking\nwith administrators and lawyers in low voices, slouching criminals in irons\nbeing ferried about.\nEtzi strode past them all without stopping, until they reached a large,\nofficial-looking door.

Etzi announced himself to the guardsman outside,\nwho nodded briskly and disappeared, only to reappear a moment later with\na handful of keys. “Good afternoon, Meln-Etzi,” the guard said, nodding to\nthe Household head but not taking his eyes off Styke. “Arrangements have\nbeen made. If you’ll follow me?”\nStyke tried to ignore the work stoppages as he passed, his shoulder\nblades itching from the feel of eyes following his every move. They wound\nback through the halls, then took a short causeway out through the open air\nand entered a second building. It looked more like a prison and less like an\nadministration hall—the windows were barred, the doors double-hinged.\nCells marched down either side of the dank hall and around a corner.\n“Ben?” His name was echoed a dozen times, and suddenly faces\nappeared at the bars of those cells. Three or four to a cell, his Lancers began\na clamor that the guard unsuccessfully attempted to silence.\nStyke searched the faces for a few moments. No one seemed hurt or\notherwise mistreated. They seemed surprised to see him, with a mixture of\ngiddiness and caution. “All right, quiet down,” he said. Silence fell.\nThe guards glared at Ben. “They won’t say a word for three days, and\nnow he arrives and they won’t shut up,” one of them muttered in Dynize.\nStyke looked up and down the row of cells again, then glanced to Etzi.\n“Can I get any privacy with them?”\n“I’m afraid not,” Etzi replied. He coughed into his hand. “I thought they\nhad taken a vow of silence?”\n“They’re not great at it. Everyone all right?”\nA round of nods. “The food here sucks, Ben,” someone grumbled loudly.\n“I prefer our road rations.”\n“They seem to be in good spirits,” Etzi commented.\n“They’re hard to get down. All right, you idiots. Etzi here is Orz’s\nbrother. He’s working on a lawsuit to get you released. He’s our friend.”\nOne of the guards stepped forward. “Speak in Dynize,” he snapped.\nStyke grinned at him. “You don’t understand me?” he asked in Adran.\n“I’m watching you,” the guard warned.\n“How about now?” Styke switched to Kez. He received a blank look, so\nhe continued in that language. “Etzi is trying to get you out,” he repeated,\n“but you’re not to trust anyone here. Don’t tell anyone anything. Got it?”\nAnother round of nods. “How’s Celine and Pole?” someone asked.\n“They’re with me, safe. We’re staying at Etzi’s compound. Orz and I\nwere ambushed by enemy agents. Etzi has taken us in. That’s all you need\nto know for now. Hopefully you won’t be here long.” More nods, and Styke\nran a hand over his face. No grumbling. No remonstration. He deserved\nboth, for leading them into this shitty mess. He wished again that Ibana\nwere here, just so someone would tell him he was an idiot.\n“What language is that?” Etzi asked."

The guards followed him, scowling, and he grinned over his\nshoulder at them.\nJackal nodded to him as he approached and said in a low voice, “The\nwoman guard there speaks a few words of Kez, so don’t let them fool you.\nOne of the men speaks passable Adran. They’re listening.”\nStyke leaned against the cell, one hand on the cold stone. “Sorry about\nthe other night. We were ambushed.”\n“I gathered as much. They told us you were captured, but once Pole and\nCeline disappeared, I figured everything would work out.”\n“Have they questioned you?”\n“Quite a lot. We’ve given up nothing.”\n“They didn’t bother to collect your things from the inn,” Styke said.\n“Etzi grabbed them. He knows who we are but is keeping silent.” He spoke\nquickly, in Kez, hoping that the words would be too fast for a half-schooled\nDynize guard to keep up. By the frown of concentration on her face, he was\nright.\n“Are we safe?”\n“Speak up!” one of the guards said angrily. “No whispering! Speak in\nDynize!”\n“For now,” Styke answered, ignoring the guard. “But I still have no\nintelligence on Ibana.”\nJackal gave a small nod. “Do you remember that marshal in New\nAdopest?”\nStyke had to search his memory. Jackal had been picked up as a “public\nnuisance” by a marshal in New Adopest while on leave during one of the\nfew short lulls during the Revolution. Styke hadn’t even had to get involved\n—Jackal simply escaped the city prison and rejoined the Lancers before\nnews of his arrest had even reached Styke.\n“Similar situation?” Styke asked, resisting the urge to case the locks,\nbars, and walls.\n“Yes.”\n“Good. If you need anything—anything—just look for Etzi’s\nHousehold.”\nAnother small nod. “Yes, sir.”\nTheir conversation was finally broken up by the irritated guards, who\nmade a stink about a time limit. They hurried Styke and Etzi out of the\nprison and back to the main administration building. Etzi argued with them\nthe entire way—complaining about the time limit—but didn’t physically\nresist. The guards grumbled about foreign languages and secret deals. Styke\ndidn’t object. He’d gotten what he came for.\nThey were soon alone in the courtyard, waiting for their carriage to\nreturn. “You should have spoken in Dynize if you wanted longer,” Etzi told\nStyke.\n“My men barely understand it,” Styke replied, staring up into the sky in\nthought. He wondered how long it would be until Jackal attempted to\nescape. The last thing he needed was Jackal getting caught and killed—or\nworse, taken alive—but the risk was necessary. He needed to find out about\nIbana."

I’m guessing they don’t like us having visits like that.”\n“You guess correctly.”\n“Would it be easier if you had one of your Household check in on them\nevery day?”\n“Significantly.”\n“Do that, then.” Styke remembered to add a “please” and “thank you” at\nthe end, hoping it didn’t sound insincere. It wasn’t as if he was ungrateful—\nhe just wasn’t used to being all that polite.\n“Of course.” Etzi waved it off. He scowled as their carriage rolled into\nthe courtyard. There was a boy riding on the running board, and the\nmoment the boy saw Etzi, he leapt off and ran on ahead. “Master, master!”\n“Yes?” Etzi asked, greeting the boy with a touch on the shoulder.\nThe boy looked both directions, wide-eyed, and then leaned forward to\nwhisper loudly. “Master, Orz is awake!”\nCHAPTER 38\nM\nichel gave the old man a day to recover—a good meal, sleep in a real\nbed, a bath and shave, and gentle conversation. Still, he refused to give his\nname. Whether he did not want to be associated with a checkered past or\nsimply feared the telling of his tale to come back and haunt him, Michel\ncould not decipher. He dubbed the old man Survivor, and he took him and\nthe three children to Jiniel and her lieutenants and listened carefully while\nhe told his tale.\nThe reactions varied. Devin-Mezi looked on in horror. Another\nlieutenant was aghast with disbelief. Two more wept openly. Jiniel herself\nlistened in stoic silence, her jaw tightening, veins bulging from her forehead\nas more details came out. Once Survivor had finished his story, she gestured\nfor the children to give their own testimonies. Everyone was finally sent\naway, leaving Michel and Ichtracia with Jiniel and her four lieutenants.\nNo one spoke. Michel could read the shock on their faces. He gave them\nseveral minutes to process the information before he cleared his throat.\n“You wanted evidence,” he said.\nDevin-Mezi swore.\n“I did not imagine…” Jiniel trailed off.\n“I didn’t, either,” Michel replied. “I suspected the details, but I didn’t\nconsider the real implications of this.”\nJiniel looked around at her lieutenants, then focused her eyes on Michel.\n“What do we do?” There was a note of helplessness in her voice. “We are\noutnumbered. Outgunned. The Dynize hold everything. We have been\ndoing what we can to safeguard the Palo from our position here, but we’ve\nbeen operating on the assumption that the Dynize are our friends. Now we\nknow they aren’t. They are using us, just as everyone else has used us.”"

They are using us, just as everyone else has used us.”\n“You’re wrong about that,” Michel said. He’d been thinking about this\nfor weeks. Planning. Considering.\n“About what?”\n“That we’re outnumbered and outgunned. The Dynize have recruited\nPalo into every facet of their lives. We clean their houses, run their new\nlabor camps, build their citadel around the godstone. They’re even training\nus to fight for them. They may have the armies, but this is our land. We\noutnumber them ten to one. We exist here. They made a tactical choice to\ninclude us in their new empire—a good choice, from their perspective. But\nthey then thought they could steal away our lowliest citizens and use them\nin their blood magic. If they’d stopped at the first, you and I might be\nreaching out to help them take their fight to Lindet. But they didn’t.”\n“So we have the people,” Devin-Mezi replied bitterly. “But we are\noutgunned. We have what, a few thousand fighters?”\n“Right now? Yes. But an angry population can mobilize to arms in a\nfrighteningly short amount of time.”\n“You’re suggesting we rise up?” Jiniel asked.\n“I am.”\n“We’ll be slaughtered.”\n“There will be casualties,” Michel admitted. The idea stuck a knife in his\ngut, but he had to ignore it. “There might be a lot of casualties. But if we\ndon’t stop the Dynize now, we will forever be a people in bondage.”\nJiniel examined him over steepled fingers. “Michel and Ichtracia, can\nyou give us a moment?”\nMichel nodded. He and Ichtracia retreated to the hall, where they stood\nin silence while a murmur of voices came to them through the door to\nJiniel’s office. Ichtracia still looked shell-shocked with anger. Of all the\npeople here, Survivor’s story seemed to have struck her the deepest. Michel\nthought about what she’d said weeks ago—of her claim that all that blood\ncould have been avoided if she’d just offered her own. He wondered if she\nstill felt the same way. He wondered if she had doubts. He knew he did.\n“I might be goading my people into walking into a slaughter,” he said\nquietly.\n“You’re hesitating?”\n“Of course I’m hesitating. Like I said, I might be—”\n“Don’t.” The word was whispered forcefully. “Just… don’t. These\npeople—your people—need to fight. You’re giving them the best chance.”\nMichel did not reply. He sank into his own thoughts and plans, turning\nthem over and over again in his mind while they waited. Finally, after what\nfelt like hours, they were summoned back inside.\nMama Palo and her council looked shaken but determined. “You’ve\nclearly considered this,” Jiniel said. “And we’ve agreed that you should be\nin command. How do we do this? How do we rouse the Palo? How do we\nfight back?”\nMichel sat down. “Word travels fast in the Depths,” he began. “We are\ngoing to fight the Dynize the same way that Lindet has kept us down and"

Putting all\nthis in motion won’t take long, but the results could come in a week, or in\nmonths. So we begin our propaganda campaign immediately.”\n“You have a plan for this?” Jiniel asked.\n“I do. But also know this: Once we unleash this thing, there is no going\nback. There is no controlling it. Landfall will suffer. We will suffer.”\nJiniel looked around at her lieutenants once more. “We are agreed.”\n“Good. It’s time to start the fire that will burn everything down.”\nStyke stood outside the Etzi Household infirmary, trying not to listen to the\nrising voices within. On the other side of the doorway stood Maetle, her\neyes on the ground, twiddling her thumbs.\nA particularly loud shout issued from within, mostly consisting of a\nstring of obscenities. Everyone else had already cleared out of this wing of\nthe compound, leaving Styke and Maetle alone. He wished he had his\nwhittling, or something to read, or anything to pass the time while the two\nbrothers fought inside.\n“Should I go?” he asked Maetle.\nThe nurse finally looked up, met his eyes momentarily, then resumed\nstaring at the opposite wall. “He said to wait here.” She shrugged. “So we\nwait here.”\n“Is this sort of thing normal?”\n“The shouting? Oh, no.” Maetle scowled, as if the question itself were\nimpertinent. “You overhear arguments and lesser dramas living with the\nHousehold, but Etzi is a gentle man. His relationship with his family,\nthough…” She trailed off.\nStyke didn’t push her further. “Understood.”\nIt was at least fifteen minutes before the arguing died down to something\nmore civil, the words less pronounced and more difficult to make out.\nAnother ten minutes after that passed before the door opened and Etzi\nemerged, red-faced and hair mussed. “Stubborn bastard,” he muttered,\nrunning a hand across his face. He seemed to realize he was not alone,\nlooking first to Maetle and then to Styke.\n“Did he hurt himself?” Maetle asked in a gentle tone.\nEtzi had the wherewithal to look embarrassed. “He might have strained\nhimself a little.”\n“I need to check on him.”\n“Wait.” Etzi held up one hand. “First, he wants to talk to Ben. I’ll be in\nmy office if anyone needs me.” Etzi strode off, muttering under his breath,\ngesturing angrily to himself.\nStyke watched him go, then turned to Maetle. She shook her head. “Best\nsee what he wants. Try not to get him too worked up. I know dragonmen are\ntough, but the more he exerts himself, the longer it will take him to\nrecover.”\n“Right.” Styke stepped inside and closed the door behind him.

His eyes opened when\nStyke reached his side, and they took a few moments to focus on Styke’s\nface.\n“You stupid piece of shit,” Orz said weakly in Adran.\nStyke rolled his eyes and sat down beside the bed, drawing his knife and\nusing the tip to clean dirt from beneath his fingernails. He’d been accosted\nby more than one angry, injured soldier in his time. Nothing to do but\nweather it. “You’re welcome.”\n“Don’t ‘you’re welcome’ me. I told you I didn’t want to involve my\nbrother.”\n“Yeah, well, I didn’t have much choice after you walked into an\nambush.”\n“You should have left me to die.”\n“Maybe.” Styke shrugged. “But I didn’t. I still have use for you.”\nThere was a long moment of silence. Orz closed his eyes, his breath\ncoming out in shallow, ragged gasps. Just when Styke thought that he might\nhave passed out, his eyes flashed open once more. “He thinks I got our\nmother killed.”\n“You kind of did.”\nOrz’s brow wrinkled. Another tense silence, and he let out a wheezing\nlaugh. “You would have made a terrible doctor.”\n“There’s a reason I do what I do.”\n“Yes. And despite what Etzi may think, my conscience is clean. I did not\nkill her. I was trying to save her.” He made a fist, then let his fingers relax,\nthen repeated the effort as if to judge his own strength. “I thought I knew\nSedial’s mind. I won’t make that mistake again.”\n“Probably for the best,” Styke commented.\n“Etzi knows nothing of our designs here?”\n“I haven’t told him and he’s made it clear that he doesn’t want to know.”\n“Etzi is no fool.”\n“He told you about the suit?”\n“Yes. It’s our best chance at vengeance, but it may still get him and his\nentire Household killed. He’s being careful not to attack Sedial openly, but\nthe Ka will still see it as a slap in the face. When he returns—”\n“If he returns.”\nOrz took a few long breaths. “You think your sister can best him? When\nwe left, she had all but lost the continent.”\n“She was on the back foot,” Styke admitted. “But she’s not a fool, either,\nand she won’t pull punches.”\nOrz eyeballed Styke. “No, I imagine she won’t. You know, I was spying\non a group of officers camped outside of Starlight when the rumor came\naround that you were her brother. One of them actually spit his drink on the\nother two.” He let out a weak chuckle.\n“There’s a reason we kept it hidden for most of our lives.”\n“Family provides a weakness that can be exploited by your enemies,”\nOrz said, touching his bandaged chest with two fingers.\n“Among other things, yes.” Styke used the tip of the knife to root a\nblackberry seed out from between his teeth. “This sorcery you’ve got\nkeeping you together—is it strong enough to put you back in a saddle?”"

But not nearly as long as a normal person, either.”\n“How long?”\n“A few weeks, I’d say. It’ll hurt, but I’ll be able to ride.”\nStyke didn’t think they had that long. “We need to get out of here as\nsoon as possible. Preferably before someone finds my army down south.”\n“Have you confirmed that they made landfall?”\n“No. But I’ve dispatched a man to do so.”\n“And if they haven’t?”\n“Then I’ll have to change my plans right quick.” Styke twirled his big\nLancer ring with one finger. “We’ll get you out of the city, head down the\ncoast, and try to find a port where we can bribe, threaten, or beg our way\nback to Fatrasta.”\n“An ignominious end to your venture.”\n“Quite.”\n“Will you give up on the godstone?”\n“I never said that. But I will need to regroup.”\n“Good to have contingency plans.”\n“I’ll need a lot of those. I’m not completely confident that Etzi can get\nme out of the city, or save my men from Sedial’s goons, or even keep\nhimself alive through the next few weeks. I’m going to keep my knife\nhandy.”\nOrz did not respond, but he gave the smallest of nods as if he agreed\nwith Styke’s assessment. “You saved my life,” he said suddenly.\n“It sounded like you’d rather I hadn’t.”\n“It doesn’t matter what I want. The fact is you did save it, and for that I\nthank you.”\n“Help me get out of the city and we’ll call it even.”\n“Done. But I have another request, one I am loath to put upon you.”\nStyke hesitated. Orz was no longer a stranger, but it was difficult to call\nhim a friend. They shared an odd kinship, that was for sure, but he didn’t\nknow how much more involved he wanted to become in the dragonman’s\nlife. “What is it?”\n“If I die,” Orz said, “and if it is within your power to do so, I want you\nto kill the dragonman who murdered my mother.”\nStyke considered the request. He had enough experience now that he felt\nhe could kill a dragonman. But he also knew he was taking his life in his\nhands every time he crossed paths with one of them. It was not something\nto take lightly. “I’ll consider it.”\n“A smart man would say no without hesitation.”\n“Have I ever struck you as a smart man?”\n“Smarter than you’ll admit, Ben Styke.” Orz let his eyes fall closed and\nlet his head fall back. His sweating had intensified again, his hands\ntrembling. “How is Ka-poel?”\n“Keeping her head down.”\n“Etzi was not happy about you bringing a bone-eye into his Household.”\n“He hasn’t said anything to me.”\n“Because he’s considering.”\n“Considering what?”\nOrz did not answer.

He was out. Styke stood up, tapping his ring against his thumb, and\nleft the room quietly. “He’s asleep,” he told Maetle, who nodded in\nappreciation and headed inside.\nStyke thrust his hands into his pockets and looked up to the cloudless\nsky, admiring the vibrant blue of it. He could hear Celine laughing\nsomewhere nearby, and the happy shouts of her playmates. The sound\nboosted his mood, but he knew that this moment of comfort was an illusion.\nEverything he’d seen and done here had complicated his feelings about\nDynize—complications he could not afford. Sedial’s agents would soon\nstrike back, and he still had a job to do on this continent.\nThere was a storm on the horizon. The only question was who would\nunleash it first: him, or his enemies?\nCHAPTER 39\nV\nlora listened as an aide finished giving a long, comprehensive briefing of\nthe Dynize-Fatrastan situation to a tent jam-packed with senior officers and\nnewly arrived dignitaries, but primarily, to Delia Snowbound and Provost\nMarshal Valeer, both sitting in the front row. The briefing had begun the\nmoment the army stopped to make camp over an hour and a half ago, and\neveryone had been listening in complete silence for the entire duration.\nBo and Nila had chosen the presenter strategically—a young, clean-cut\nofficer with a penchant for public speaking. He’d been with Vlora for these\nlast two years in Fatrasta, so he could talk with personal passion and\nexperience, but he had no personal ties to the Adran coup of a decade ago\nand would not, in theory, offend Delia and Valeer by his mere presence.\nVlora had half listened. She’d written the majority of the briefing, after\nall. Her real concern was watching the faces of the special envoys, hoping\nagainst hope that she might be able to get through their thick skulls and\nimpress upon them the importance of everything that was going on across\nthe continent.\nTheir expressionless absorption of the information did not give her a lot\nof optimism.\nThe young aide finished the briefing with an overview of the Midnight\nMassacre. Vlora had decided not to sugar-coat it, hoping that if she gave\nDelia the ammunition to humiliate her before the government back in Adro,\nthe special envoy might not ruin everything now. It was a minor gamble as\nthese things went—Delia would find out about the Midnight Massacre\neventually, if she hadn’t already. But if there’s one thing Bo had taught her\nabout politics, it was to play to the plans and prejudices of her enemies.\nThe aide cleared his throat, thanked the audience, and took a seat. Vlora\nwaited a few beats and then climbed to her feet, leveraging herself with her\nsword, and limped to the center of the room. She swept her gaze across the\nstern visages of her general staff. They knew most of this already, of course,\nbut she had wanted them here to solidify their loyalty. Delia would try to\nget to them over the next few weeks. She needed them all on board with her"

        "text": "but she had wanted them here to solidify their loyalty. Delia would try to\nget to them over the next few weeks. She needed them all on board with her\nconcerns—and her plans in dealing with those concerns.\n“Taniel Two-shot is alive,” Delia said, breaking the silence.\nIt was not the first thing Vlora had expected to hear, and it threw her off\nguard. “That is correct,” she answered, swearing quietly to herself. She\nshould have expected it. He would no doubt immediately rise to the top of\nDelia’s shitlist, making Vlora grateful that he’d left after the Crease.\n“It sounds very much as if he’s gone native.” Delia paused, as if\nexpecting an answer. When Vlora did not respond, she went on. “I will need\nto gather more information, but in the meantime I want him brought in for\nquestioning. Take a note, Provost Marshal. Taniel Two-shot should be\nconsidered an enemy of the state of Adro. Nothing he says or does should\nbe trusted until we are able to debrief him.”\nVlora’s stomach turned. An arrest warrant for Taniel. She wasn’t worried\nabout him, of course. As far as she knew, he was on the other side of the\ncontinent by now. She exchanged a glance with Bo. “Lady Snowbound, I\nwould recommend against taking an antagonistic stance with Taniel.”\n“Would you?” Delia asked lightly.\nVlora could sense a trap, but she went on anyway. “Taniel helped save\nthe lives of my mercenary company, and he’s a war hero back from the\ndead. If the men find out that he’s wanted for questioning, it might not go\nwell for morale.”\n“That’s not my problem, Lady Flint,” Delia said in a clipped,\nprofessional tone. “As long as you remain in command, I expect you to\nkeep the discipline among your troops. My order stands.” She removed a\npair of reading glasses from her breast pocket and put them on, gazing\ndown at a stack of notes that she’d been adding to throughout the briefing.\n“Now, may I continue?”\n“Go ahead,” Vlora said through clenched teeth.\n“My first point of order is this: The moment at which you ceased being a\ncommon mercenary thug and began operating as an agent of the Adran\ngovernment is the moment that you accepted command of this army. What\nwas the date and time of that?”\nVlora glanced at Bo again, who just shrugged. “I’m not entirely certain.\nI’d have to check.”\n“Do so. Now, as I mentioned before, we shall regard Taniel Two-shot as\na foreign national. Any interaction with him or his agents is highly suspect.\nFortunately for you, it appears that he left this camp before you became\ncognizant enough to take command of the army.” She swept her gaze across\nto Bo. “That is not the case, however, for Magus Borbador. Magus, you\nmay have cowed many members of the governing council with threats and\nbribes, but you won’t find me nearly as lax with your blatant disregard of\nAdran law. Raising an army at the behest of a foreign national?” She\nscoffed. “You’ve broken dozens of laws.”"

Raising an army at the behest of a foreign national?” She\nscoffed. “You’ve broken dozens of laws.”\n“I left my legal counsel in Adro,” Bo said lightly. “I’m afraid you’ll have\nto wait and take it up when you get back home.”\n“Dozens of laws, I say! You’ve consorted with an enemy agent,\nsmuggled an entire field army out of Adro, and engaged the forces of a\nsovereign nation, all without proper authorization from your betters. As you\nyourself have reminded me in the past, this is no longer pre-coup Adro.\nPrivileged cannot get away with doing whatever they want.”\nBo adopted a dismissive air, removing his pipe from his pocket and\nslowly, meticulously cleaning it before packing in new tobacco and lighting\nit with the flick of gloved fingers. Despite his presentation, Vlora could see\nin his eyes that he was fuming. He had to have known that Delia would\nthrow all of this in his face. Had he been so confident in his own position\nthat he hadn’t bothered preparing a rebuttal?\nDelia continued, “We may be in a backwater, but I’m sure we can\nconvene a perfectly legal tribunal to try the case. I have no interest in\nwaiting to deal with your cabal lawyers back in Adro.”\nA cloud of smoke rose from Bo’s puffing. He regarded her coldly. “Try\nit.”\n“Are you threatening me, Magus Borbador?” Most people would sweat\nbullets dealing with a Privileged, even these days. But Delia didn’t blink.\n“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Bo replied. “As Lady Flint tried to do a few\nminutes ago, I just want to remind you where you are.”\n“Surrounded by war hawks,” Delia spat, looking around the room.\n“Don’t think I don’t know. And don’t think that if I disappear on this\nexpedition, every single one of your careers won’t end the moment you\nreturn to Adro. There’s not a single one of you who won’t face charges for\nyour complacency in this farce. How extensive those charges are will\ndepend entirely on your cooperation.”\nThere was a general, uncomfortable shift in the audience. Several of the\ngeneral staff clearly took the threat to heart—faces went pale, uneasy\nmutters were exchanged in the back row. Others hardened, as if this were\nsome kind of challenge. Delia was known as a woman not to be trifled with,\nbut those angry stares made Vlora wonder if she’d have to post an extra\nguard outside Delia’s tent just to make sure none of her officers took this\ninto their own hands.\n“‘Farce’?” Vlora’s voice cracked as she repeated the word.\nValeer leaned over and whispered in Delia’s ear. She inhaled sharply, her\ngaze returning to Vlora. “A poor choice of words,” she said, sorting through\nher notes for a few moments as if to gather her thoughts. She finally\ncontinued. “Despite our mutual antagonism, we are all Adrans, and this is,\nfor better or worse, an Adran expedition.

Your briefing was most thorough,\nand I’m not an idiot—we are clearly dealing with something that warrants\nthe attention of not just the Adran government but likely the governments of\nthe entire world.” She paused to whisper back to Valeer. They had a quick\nconversation, and she went on.\n“In my authority as special envoy, I declare thusly: The organization and\nlaunch of this expedition is in question. However, I believe that question\nshould be dealt with once we return to Adro. Furthermore…” She paused,\nsighed. “Furthermore, the expedition is here, regardless of legality. I agree\nthat the situation warrants Lady Flint’s invocation of the Tamas Clause.”\nA collective breath was released in the room, and Vlora’s added to it.\nShe felt a knot between her shoulders loosen just a tiny amount. But she\ndidn’t allow herself to grow too complacent. Delia clearly wasn’t done.\n“And?” Vlora asked.\nThe special envoy fixed Vlora with a long, thoughtful gaze. “The Tamas\nClause requires that the head of the army in question engage in constant,\ngood-faith negotiations with whatever force he or she has engaged. Have\nyou done that?”\n“I met with the Dynize general outside of New Adopest,” Vlora said,\nslightly confused. That part of the clause was wide open to interpretation.\nNot much Delia could do to pin her with treason.\n“And before the Midnight Massacre?”\n“Strategy necessitated that we not meet with the enemy directly before\nthe battle.”\n“I see.” Delia wrote something down. No doubt a note to make sure\nVlora suffered for that mistake. But she still wasn’t done here, and Vlora\nfound herself on edge. “Good.” Delia looked up. “Well, now that I’m here, I\ninvoke my powers as special envoy to take over any and all negotiations on\nbehalf of Adro with the Dynize and Fatrastan governments.”\nVlora felt as if she’d been punched in the gut. There it was. Delia had\njust established herself as the Adran authority in the region. Vlora was still,\nessentially, field marshal of this army. But Delia’s political authority—using\nVlora’s own declaration of the Tamas Clause—now put her in position to\nsecond-guess all of Vlora’s decisions, all the while engaging in talks with\nthe Dynize that could at any minute put a stop to all of Vlora’s plans.\nShe felt herself suddenly so weak and tired. All of her work, all of her\nanguish, now put in the balance. This could have happened with any special\nenvoy, of course, and she knew deep down that Delia was right—the Adran\ngovernment couldn’t afford to allow an entire field army to operate in a\nforeign war without any oversight. But the fact that it was Delia made it a\nthousand times worse. Vlora had every confidence that Delia would go to\ngreat lengths to undermine her at every turn.\n“All right,” Vlora said weakly. “Is there more?”\n“Much more, but it can wait until I’ve better mapped the lay of the\npolitical landscape.” Delia tapped her pencil against her chin. “The army\nneeds to stop marching so that I can make contact with the Dynize and\nFatrastans.”"

She couldn’t even muster\nindignation. Just flat annoyance.\n“Excuse me? Were you not paying attention to—”\nVlora cut her off. “You’re in charge of the politics. I’m still in charge of\nthe army and I’m waging a goddamn war.”\n“A war that I am charged with ending!”\n“Independent of my actions,” Vlora replied. “Begin your negotiations.\nMake contact with Sedial—I imagine that the two of you will get on very\nwell with your mutual loathing of me. But I will not give up strategic\nadvantage so that you can make overtures to a blood-hungry warlord. If you\nhave any other questions, feel free to put them to General Sabastenien or\nMagus Borbador. I’m going to get some rest.”\nThe last thing she heard when she left the tent was Delia’s indignant\nhuffing, but the sound didn’t give Vlora any pleasure. She stood outside for\na moment, trying to gather her thoughts, when she was joined by Bo. She\nheld up a hand to forestall whatever it was he was about to say. “I’m too\ntired, Bo.”\n“I know, but I have something you want to see.”\n“Can it wait until the morning?”\nBo cleared his throat, glancing around to make sure no one would\noverhear him, and then said in a low voice, “If you’d like. I received a\ncoded message from Taniel.”\nThe words sent a spark through Vlora, giving her just enough energy to\nreact. “Give it to me.”\nBo produced a folded paper and slipped it to her. “Came by messenger a\nfew hours ago. I spent the meeting translating it.”\nVlora opened the paper. It was a long letter, containing a great deal of\nmundane gibberish that a distant spouse might write to keep their other half\ninformed. At the bottom was one short paragraph, written in Bo’s\nhandwriting: the real message.\nThird godstone is in Dynize. Styke has gone after it with Ka-poel.\nProblems with the crossing. Their position is fraught. Possible\nDynize allies. On my way to join them as quickly as possible. When\nyou reach Landfall, make contact with Michel Bravis. Fully trusted\nspy. This will be my last update before setting sail.\n—T\n“In Dynize.” She sighed. “Which means they probably already have it in\ntheir possession.” The idea made her stomach twist.\n“Seems likely.”\nVlora read it again and looked at Bo. “His last update? Were there\nothers?”\n“No idea. It’s possible he sent us a couple of messages that we never\ngot. Or he’s just warning us that we won’t hear from him again.”\nThe tension of sitting through that briefing after a hard day’s march had\nleft Vlora dizzy. She gave the letter back to Bo. “We can’t expect any help\nfrom Taniel, except for the man he left in Landfall.”\n“Could be useful. Interesting that Styke is in Dynize now.”"

That madman.”\nShe rubbed her face. There was nothing she could do for Styke or Taniel but\ngo ahead with her own plans. And to do that… well, she needed sleep. She\nbid good night to Bo and headed to her tent, forced to lean on Davd’s arm\nfor the last few dozen paces to her own quarters. She went inside and\ncollapsed onto her cot without removing her uniform.\nA few hours of sleep, then she’d review the daily reports by candlelight.\nNot enough time to rest. Even more than before, speed was of the essence.\nCHAPTER 40\nV\nlora sat on horseback in the center of an abandoned town just off the\nhighway in east-central Fatrasta. The air was choked with the dust of her\narmy marching past just over the next hill, and the oppressive afternoon sun\nmade her want nothing more than to find a nearby tree and take a nap. But\nthey’d ridden into the foothills and then back down onto the plains, which\nwere chock-full with cotton and tobacco. Trees here were few and far\nbetween.\nGeneral Sabastenien sat beside her, examining the silent town with a\nfrown. “We’ve come across a dozen towns like this in just the last twenty-\nfour hours,” he said. “Completely abandoned. Stripped of all resources,\nsigns of violence, no one to tell us what has happened.”\n“Violence?” Vlora echoed. The town, she didn’t mind admitting,\nspooked her. Doors hung off their hinges; wind whistled through open\nwindows. Livestock pens were empty. There wasn’t a soul in sight. She\ncouldn’t even spot any dogs or cats anywhere. Out of sight, a lone crow\ncalled.\n“Mass graves,” Sabastenien said solemnly.\n“By Adom,” Vlora swore.\n“We haven’t had the time to exhume any of them, but from what we’ve\ngathered, it seems that whole populations were marched to the edge of town\nand shot, then buried.”\n“Who would do this?”\n“There are really only two options: the Dynize or the Fatrastans. Lindet\nmay be a dictator, but I never pinned her as the type to slaughter her own\npeople.”\n“Maybe her armies are stripping the countryside and killing the\nwitnesses?” Vlora didn’t believe it herself.\n“Maybe?” Sabastenien allowed.\n“Why would the Dynize do this?”\nHe shook his head. “Your bet is as good as mine.”\n“Why haven’t I been told about this?”\n“As I said, it’s just been the last twenty-four hours. We had to come\nsome distance from the Cape of New Adopest before we ran into these\nabandoned towns.”\nVlora’s scowl deepened. There was a mystery here, something she\ncouldn’t quite get her hands around. It had to relate to the current war, but\nshe couldn’t come up with a good excuse to slow down and investigate. She\njust had far more urgent matters on her hands. “Could it be something else?\nA local warlord using the war to establish their own power base?”"

She\njust had far more urgent matters on her hands. “Could it be something else?\nA local warlord using the war to establish their own power base?”\nSabastenien spread his hands. “I wish I knew.”\n“Right.” Vlora sighed. “We can’t afford to stop, but I want you to put\ntogether a fire team and a couple of surgeons. Next time we come across\none of these towns, give them an hour to try and figure out what happened.\nOh, and tell Nila and Bo. They’ll want to check for any signs of sorcery.”\n“Yes, ma’am.”\nA chill went up Vlora’s spine as she realized her mistake. Sabastenien\nwas not one of the few people privy to her condition. He simply nodded and\nturned his horse back toward the column. If he’d caught her slipup, he\ndidn’t mention it. She stilled her thumping heart and rode after him.\nShe found Bo about a half mile up the column. She let her horse nudge\nhis way in between Bo and Nila’s horses. The two exchanged a glance, both\nof them giggled, and then Bo broke into an open laugh as Vlora began to\nride between them. “What’s so funny?” she asked, casting a look at each of\nthem.\n“Nothing, nothing,” Bo said.\n“Nothing at all,” Nila echoed.\n“Privileged shouldn’t giggle,” Vlora growled. “It completely destroys\nyour image.”\nNila cleared her throat, regaining her composure before her husband.\n“She’s right, you know.”\nBo nodded gravely.\nAs much as these two could get on Vlora’s nerves, she had to admit that\nit was good to hear genuine laughter. Her general staff tended to be an\nolder, more serious lot, while her soldiers were always so formal around\nher. The fact that Bo and Nila seemed to actually find joy in just about\nevery situation helped mend her heart.\nShe rolled her eyes. “Have you heard about these abandoned towns?”\nshe asked.\nBoth of them shook their heads.\n“Talk to Sabastenien. Something strange is going on and I want to make\nsure there isn’t a sorcerous component.”\nBo shrugged. “We can do that.”\n“Have you been keeping an eye on Delia?”\n“Do you really have to ask?” Nila replied indignantly.\n“What do you have?”\nBo snorted. “Nothing we didn’t expect. She wasted no time in sending\nout emissaries. Riders went out from her High Provosts last night after the\nbriefing. Looks like she’s sent people to all three of the armies closing in on\nus, as well as down to Landfall and down around the Ironhooks to try and\nmeet up with Lindet.”\n“She’s moving quickly,” Vlora commented.\n“Very quickly,” Nila confirmed. “Last night after you retired, she met\npersonally with every one of your general staff.”\nVlora resisted the urge to growl like a dog. Delia was going to do\neverything in her power to turn the generals against her. “And?”\n“The meetings were private, so we didn’t have any spies to listen in,” Bo\nsaid, “but I’ve talked to a few of them, and she’s just doing the same thing"

Half\nof your general staff is terrified of her and the other half wants to add her to\nthe unmarked grave where Tamas buried all of her noble cousins ten years\nago.”\n“‘Terrified,’” Vlora spat. She tried to rein in her disgust. If she wanted\nto, she could retire tomorrow and travel the world comfortably for the rest\nof her life without many regrets. Unlike her, most of the generals had a lot\nto lose—they had families, hard-won careers, reputations, and more that\nDelia could threaten. They weren’t stupid, and only the most stubborn of\nthem would openly defy her. “Any impressions?”\n“Too early to tell,” Bo said. “I will note that Delia is no fool, and she’s\nnever indicated that she would sell out the country just to spite her\nenemies.”\nVlora hesitated. She and Delia had butted heads on several occasions\nthroughout the Kez Civil War. While she had to admit that Delia had never\nsold her out directly, she’d made several decisions for the sole purpose of\nspiting Vlora—and this was part of what made her so unpredictable. When\nwould she do what was best for Adro, and when would she do what was\nworst for Tamas’s old allies and kin?\nShe let her meditations turn toward Sedial. The Dynize warlord was\nhimself an enigma. He’d shown both ruthless cunning and petty\nvindictiveness. Would he hold his grudge toward Vlora and keep up the\nfight? Or would he lose his nerve at the sight of an Adran field army and\ngrab on to whatever terms Delia offered to end the conflict? Dynize itself\nwas also a mystery. Their armies had proved to be both numerous and\nstrong, and it was impossible to tell just how many more they had ready to\nsend over from their mainland.\nShe scowled at the sky, wishing it was late enough that she could call a\nhalt. Many more miles to go today, though. “Is Prime Lektor with us?”\n“He is,” Nila said. “Hiding with the baggage train, I understand.” She\nsniffed in irritation.\nVlora cocked an eyebrow at her. “You met him?”\n“Nila is under the impression that Prime is a bit of a worm,” Bo\nexplained.\n“Oh?” Vlora asked. “You know what he is, right?”\n“I know exactly what he is,” Nila grumbled. “A man with that much\npower has responsibilities. Instead, he’s a coward. He prefers to put his\nhead under a rock and study his books rather than take an active role in the\nworld.”\n“I think the term you’re looking for is ‘pacifist,’” Bo suggested.\n“I know what a pacifist is,” Nila objected, “and I’ve met pacifists who\nwouldn’t raise a fist to hurt a fly but would still work for the betterment of\nmankind.”\n“Prime,” Bo said as if in an aside to Vlora, “is terrified of Nila.”\n“I can’t imagine why.” Vlora rolled her eyes. “Keep him close.

This\npedestal we’re going to retrieve from the Palo Nation irregulars is part of\nthe godstone he studied in Yellow Creek. We’ll need his expertise.”\nNila snorted but offered no other comment.\n“Lady Flint!” A voice cut off Vlora’s next thoughts, and she turned to\nfind General Sabastenien riding toward her. She waited until he was close\nbefore raising a hand in greeting. He returned the gesture. “Ma’am, I have\nnews about these abandoned towns.”\n“So soon?”\n“One of our scouts just brought in a survivor. Would you like to meet\nhim?”\nVlora cast a glance back over at Bo and Nila, then gave a nod. “Lead\non.”\nThey left the two Privileged behind and headed to the baggage train,\nwhere Sabastenien directed her toward the back of one of the wagons. It\nhad been pulled off the road, a bit of canvas thrown over the back to shade\nit. The driver was off to one side, watering the mule, while an officer and a\nsurgeon tended to a figure sitting on the open tailgate. It took Vlora a\nmoment to realize that the figure was a young man—rather than a child—\nhunched over and clutching at a blanket tossed over his bare shoulders.\nVlora dismounted and approached to a respectful distance. The officer\nwatched thoughtfully while the surgeon asked questions in a gentle tone.\n“How long has it been?”\nThe young man shivered violently. “Three weeks, I think. What’s\ntoday?”\nHe was given the date.\n“No—four weeks. I remember because it was Nan’s birthday.”\n“And you’ve been hiding in the hills all this time?”\nThe young man looked up, squinting at Vlora before turning his gaze\nback to the ground between his knees. “It was about a week before I got up\nthe courage to come down to the town… but they’d stripped us of\neverything. Cattle, flour, fruit and veg. They even found the bottle of spirits\nthat Dad kept under the floorboards for a rainy day.”\n“Who?” Vlora cut in.\nThe officer gave Vlora a nod and then asked softly, “Donovel, this is\nGeneral Flint, the leader of our expedition. Do you think you could tell her\nwhat you told me a few minutes ago?”\nDonovel looked up again, this time with a sharp sort of recognition.\n“Flint? Flint?” he echoed. “You crushed the Dynize at Landfall?”\n“Aye,” Vlora answered gravely.\nHe suddenly lurched forward, leaving the wagon tailgate and nearly\nfalling face-first in the dirt as he caught Vlora by the hand. “It was the\nDynize,” he said desperately. “They swept through like locusts. Took\neverything we had, bundled up all the Palo, then dragged all of us Kressians\nto the edge of town and shot us. My dad, my Nan. Everyone I know and\nlove.”\nVlora’s jaw clenched. “Do you know why?”\n“I wasn’t there,” Donovel said. Tears began to form. “I was out tending"

They got my goats a\ncouple hours later, but they didn’t get me. I managed to hide near the old\nwindmill—good view of the town. I saw what they did to everyone, and I\nsaw them leave again.” The words came out in a jumbled panic, barely\nunderstandable.\nVlora resisted the urge to shake off his grip, instead giving his hand a\nlittle squeeze. So it was the Dynize. But why? What purpose could they\npossibly have to gain in killing Kressians and kidnapping Palo? Hard labor?\nIf so, why didn’t they take the Kressians, too? A sudden thought struck her.\n“This was a month ago?”\nA nod.\n“Describe the banners this army had.”\nDonovel sketched out the normal black with red stars, but also a number\nof secondary banners of varying shapes, designs, and colors. Vlora gave a\nsidelong look at the officer and surgeon. “Any of that sound familiar?”\nThe officer spoke up. “It wasn’t that field army that slipped us outside\nNew Adopest.”\n“General Etepali.”\n“Not them, no.”\nThe surgeon nodded to herself. “No, ma’am. It was the army that you\nand Taniel Two-shot…” She trailed off.\nVlora held back a snarl, turning back to Donovel. “Your kin have been\navenged.”\nHis eyes grew wide. “You’re certain?”\nVlora unbuttoned the front of her jacket and pulled it aside to show him\na puckered scar that ran from her collarbone down and across her left arm.\nEven after all this time it was a nasty-looking wound. “I got this from their\ndragoons. I’m alive. They’re not.”\nDonovel threw himself against her, nearly knocking them both to the\nground. He wept openly now, his whole body shaking and trembling. Vlora\nstiffened, then let her arm fall around his shoulders while he cried against\nher chest. She allowed him to remain there for several minutes while the\nsurgeon and officer looked away respectfully. Even Sabastenien, still\nmounted and some distance off, bowed his head.\nVlora finally gestured to the surgeon, and with her help managed to get\nDonovel back into the wagon. She stepped away, bringing the officer with\nher. “Anything else to report?” she asked, jerking her head at Donovel.\nThe officer frowned, glancing at Sabastenien. “Well, ma’am, I was just\nput in charge of this thing minutes ago—right before this poor fellow\nstumbled into our baggage train.”\n“Right, of course. I’ll leave you to it.”\n“Thank you, ma’am. I’ll try to find out what I can.”\n“The why of it is our most pressing matter,” Vlora told him, then headed\nback to her horse. She allowed Sabastenien to dismount and help her into\nher own saddle. Once they were both riding, the brigadier general cleared\nhis throat. She looked at him sidelong. “Something wrong?”"

I\ndidn’t think anything of it before, but now…”\n“This seems very out of character for the Dynize. All the major cities\nthey’ve captured are still fully intact, correct?”\n“As far as our spies have been able to get back to us.”\n“Then why the towns?” She shook her head. “Very strange. That poor\nbastard back there—make sure he gets good care. And keep an eye out for\nmore like him.

Did\nthey go with the army?”\nDonovel blinked back at Vlora through teary eyes. He seemed not to\nunderstand the question, and then a light went on. “No, ma’am. They didn’t.\nThey were sent west, back the way the Dynize had come. Just marched off\nwith a handful of guards.”\n“In chains?”\n“No. Just walking. Seemed to me they were allowed to take their\nvaluables with them, too.”\nVlora scowled. “Right. Thank you.” She turned back to Sabastenien as\nhe caught up with her. “Next time we take prisoners, I want you to\npersonally see to it that we get some answers.”\n“Of course, ma’am.”\nVlora left him with a nod, riding back to the column and falling in with\nNorrine.

She looked serious, but pleased.\n“We’re getting requests from every corner of the Depths,” she said in a\nlow voice. “Everyone wants Survivor to come tell his story.”\n“Congratulations,” Michel replied, “you’re now the booking agent for\nthe greatest act in the city.”\n“It’s not an act,” Ichtracia said. She was listening intently, though she’d\nheard the story half a dozen times already. She wore the same look of horror\nas she had the first time and seemed no less affected. If anything, her\nemotional response seemed to grow with each telling. Michel remembered\nonce that she’d called herself a monster in service of the state. He could no\nlonger believe that. She seemed to care just as much as he did.\n“Maybe it should have been,” Jiniel said cynically. “We could have\ngotten this up and running earlier if we’d just hired a couple of actors.”\nMichel could see Ichtracia begin to react to the cynicism. He cut in\nquickly. “No. First off, we didn’t know the details. Second… well, no actor\nis this good. No actor can be this convincing.” Survivor was, he had to\nadmit, a natural storyteller. Not in a dramatic way, but with the gravitas of a\ngrandfather who’s lived through a dozen wars. He spoke in a clear,\nmeasured tone, tired emotion leaking through into his words with each\nretelling. He never smiled or tried to play to his audience. There was a raw\nhonesty to his words that no actor could possibly capture.\nJiniel nodded in agreement, and Ichtracia settled back into her seat.\n“Other than pub owners looking for something to bring in an audience,\ndo we have any rumblings?” Michel asked.\n“‘Rumblings’ is a good word,” Jiniel answered. “It’s all over the Depths.\nJust on the way over here, I saw a couple of teenagers pulling down those\nDynize propaganda posters. I’ve got word from friends on the Rim that\ngossip has already reached Upper Landfall and the Palo who moved up\nthere after the evacuation.”\nMichel trusted Jiniel not to overembellish, but he tried to remain\ncautious. Survivor had only started his public stories early this morning. It\nwas now almost midnight. Eighteen hours, give or take, was not much time\nfor word to spread. But if it was already reaching Upper Landfall, this was,\nas a friend of his in theater used to say, a performance that “had legs.”\nIt needed to be more than a performance. It needed to be the galvanizing\ncry for an entire people.\n“What other intelligence do we have?” Michel asked. “I’ve been\nfollowing Survivor around all day. Tomorrow I’m passing him off to Devin-\nMezi, but for now I need to catch up.”\nJiniel reached into her pocket and drew out a sealed envelope, sliding it\nacross the table to him. “A message from your mysterious friend,” she said.\nEmerald.

They’ve unlocked the godstone and are\nactively studying it. No word on whether they already know how it works\nand are just being cautious, or if they’re waiting for something.”\n“Probably both,” Ichtracia replied. “Sedial has collected every known\nscrap of information on the damned thing. If anyone knows how it works,\nit’s him. He spent years studying the Talunlica godstone.”\n“Talunlica?” Jiniel asked.\n“The Dynize capital,” Michel explained. “It’s where they have the\nsecond godstone.”\nJiniel scowled at them both. “Did they kill orphans for that one, too?”\n“I… I don’t think so.” Even Ichtracia seemed uncertain. “They found it\nin the swamp and constructed a city around it. But there was no protective\nsorcery to break. They didn’t need blood to make it work.”\n“I’m not sure if that’s better or worse,” Michel said.\n“Neither am I.” Ichtracia’s uncertainty deepened. She seemed about to\nsay something, but to think better of it. She glanced purposefully at Jiniel,\nand Michel made a note to ask her what she’d wanted to say the next time\nthey were in private.\nMichel waved the envelope from Emerald. “This just confirms\nsomething we already suspected. But it does mean that we need to move\nfaster. We need leverage on Ka-Sedial.”\n“What, to blackmail him?” Jiniel asked.\n“Even if we had anything, blackmail doesn’t work on Sedial,” Ichtracia\nsaid flatly. “I’ve seen it tried. He kills everyone suspected of involvement,\nand sorts out the corpses later.”\n“That’s not what I meant.” Michel tapped the envelope on the table\nthoughtfully. “I just mean anything we can use against him or the Dynize.\nYou have your agents sweeping up any information they can get their hands\non?”\nJiniel nodded. “I’ve impressed upon all of them how important it is.”\n“And how important it is not to get caught?”\n“That, too.”\n“Good.

It was\nbarely big enough for the four of them, dominated by a small dice table.\nOnce they were all seated, Devin-Mezi produced a thick binder and tossed\nit down on the table.\n“What’s this?” Michel asked.\n“Intelligence,” Devin-Mezi said. “One of our people got hired as a maid\nfor a townhouse near the capital building last week. Turns out the owner is a\ndragonman—too dangerous for us to keep her there for any length of time.\nThis morning, we had her snatch up every important-looking document she\ncould get her hands on and then made her disappear.”\nMichel raised both eyebrows at the binder. “Why didn’t I know about\nthis?”\n“You’ve been busy,” Devin-Mezi said, jerking her head toward the\ncommotion going on in the common room.\n“I authorized this,” Jiniel cut in. “Like she said, it was safer to do a\nsmash-and-grab than to try and keep someone that close to a dragonman.”\nMichel glanced at Ichtracia, who shrugged. “They’re probably right.\nDragonmen can be arrogant, but they pay more attention to their immediate\nsurroundings. Far more likely to notice someone acting suspicious.”\n“Fair enough.” Michel undid the cord on the binder and let the contents\nspill out onto the table. He was immediately taken aback. This didn’t look\nlike the contents of a warrior’s desk—this looked more like it had been\npilfered from a general or politician. There were sealed envelopes, work\norders, army missives, quartermaster reports. And that was just at a casual\nglance. “Wow,” he managed. “This is quite the coup.”\nDevin-Mezi gave them all a self-satisfied grin. “I thought so.”\n“You’re sure this came from a dragonman?” Ichtracia asked, leaning\nover the pile while Michel sorted through it.\n“I am.”\n“Do you know his name?”\n“Ji-Noren.”\nThe name tickled the back of Michel’s memory, but Ichtracia’s reaction\nwas far more telling. Her eyes grew wide and she drew in a sharp breath.\n“You’re kidding.”\n“I think that was his name?” Devin-Mezi said.\n“No, no. I believe you.” Ichtracia swore under her breath. “You just\nrobbed Ka-Sedial’s right-hand man.”\nThere was a moment of silence as that sank into the group. “Oh,” Devin-\nMezi replied.\n“You don’t rob Ji-Noren,” Ichtracia continued. “He’s one of the most\ndangerous men in the empire, easily in the top five besides Ka-Sedial\nhimself.” She looked at Devin-Mezi. “Whatever you think you’ve done to\nhide the woman who did this, do better. Get her out of the city. Far out of\nthe city. No doubt he’s already discovered that these are missing and begun\na search.” She ran a hand through her hair. “Pit, you’ve kicked a hornet’s\nnest.”\nMichel watched everyone for their reactions.

We might have done something stupid by accident, but that\ndoesn’t mean we can’t benefit.”\nDevin-Mezi waited for Jiniel to give a nod before leaving the room.\n“He’s that terrifying?” Michel asked Ichtracia.\n“I’m a Privileged, and I’m scared of him. That man you told me about,\nthe enforcer for Chancellor Lindet?”\n“Fidelis Jes?”\n“Yes, him. Ji-Noren is like Sedial’s version of him. Not as bloodthirsty\nor egotistical, but equally effective.”\n“Okay. Well, we’ll deal with this. In this meantime…” Michel resumed\ngoing through the stack of intelligence. No use in worrying about mistakes\nalready made.\nIchtracia suddenly perked up, leaning forward again and searching\nthrough the stack with one hand. She fished a little bundle out from the\nmiddle: a number of envelopes, all bound together with a black ribbon.\nThey were stamped with the three-star seal of the Dynize emperor. “I know\nthese,” she said.\nSomething about the way she said it struck Michel. “Those in\nparticular?”\n“Yes.” She got a distant look on her face. “In Sedial’s study. I saw them\nby accident.”\n“Well, let’s see what the old man has to say,” Jiniel said, reaching for the\nbundle.\nIchtracia snatched it away. “No. These are warded. Very subtle. I almost\ncouldn’t sense it, but now that I’ve touched them, they could have any sort\nof nastiness stitched into them. Open one, and it could burn the envelope, or\ncripple you, or even alert the owner that they’ve been touched.”\n“Shit,” Michel said. “Can you do anything about that?”\nIchtracia stared at the envelopes for a few moments. “The wards are\nvery tightly wound. But given a day or two, I should be able to pick them\napart.”\n“Any idea what’s in them?”\nShe shook her head.\n“All right.” Michel returned his gaze to the rest of the intelligence.\n“Let’s sort this out. Ichtracia will unwind what she has there.” He pointed to\nJiniel. “You and I will figure out what we can use. The rest leaves the city.”\n“To go where?”\nMichel sucked on his teeth. “We can send it to either Lindet or Lady\nFlint.”\n“Lady Flint? The woman who killed the last Mama Palo?” Jiniel asked\nin disbelief.\n“Or Lindet.”\n“Those are terrible options.”\n“Maybe. But Lady Flint is a friend of Taniel and Ka-poel’s, and she’s\nactively fighting to get the godstones away from Sedial. And Lindet… well,"

And Lindet… well,\nLindet has fought the Dynize to a standstill out west. She’s probably going\nto lose, but anything we can do to distract Sedial is a good thing right now.”\n“Why don’t we make a copy and send one to each of them?” Jiniel\nasked.\n“Fantastic idea.”\n“I was being sarcastic.”\n“I wasn’t. Get it done.” Michel glanced at the envelopes in Ichtracia’s\nhands. Something about them seemed off—so different from all the other\nmissives and reports in the stack. Despite the official seal, they looked more\nlike love letters than orders—thicker envelopes made out of heavy,\nexpensive paper. He tilted his head, turning his ear toward the common\nroom where one of Survivor’s young wards was talking about the horror of\nthe Dynize citadel.\n“Whatever you have on your schedule for Survivor, double it,” he told\nJiniel. “And get our printers going on the propaganda we’ve sketched out. I\nwant everyone in Greenfire Depths to see a poster or handbill describing the\nevils of the Dynize by the end of the week. We have no idea when Sedial\nwill use the godstone. We have to work as quickly as possible.”\nCHAPTER 42\nS\ntyke was awakened by a commotion in the Etzi Household compound.\nHe was soon sitting on the edge of the bed, his boz knife lying across his\nlap as he tried to get his head around the sounds of a hushed, but angry\nconfrontation. He couldn’t make out any words, but there were multiple\nvoices involved.\nHe, Ka-poel, and Celine had been given a small room not far from the\nkitchens. It wasn’t a large space, and it suffered from being close to both the\nnoise of the kitchens and the front gate, but it was private. He looked to the\nother bed, which lay perpendicular to his own against another wall, and\nlistened for Celine’s quiet snores. She and Ka-poel were cuddled up\ntogether, but when he sought Ka-poel’s face, he saw the twin dots of the\nearly-morning light reflecting off her eyes. She’d heard the ruckus, too.\nHe guessed by that light that it was around five or five thirty. He rubbed\nhis eyes, then found his ring and slipped it on, followed by his pants and\njacket. The voices outside continued. It might have nothing to do with him,\nbut…\nThe thought ended with a gentle knock on the door. He got up to answer\nit, only to find Maetle waiting outside. She shifted from one foot to another.\n“You’re dressed?”\n“Heard a commotion.”\n“You’d better come,” she told him.\nStyke stuck his knife in his belt and followed her out into the compound.\nIt was just two short turns before they reached the front gate. Two groups\nhad already gathered—one consisted of Etzi, the night watchman, and four\nof his Household guards. The sight of the other group almost made Styke\nmiss a step, and he swore quietly. It was Ji-Patten, along with six of the city\nguard."

It was Ji-Patten, along with six of the city\nguard.\n“You!” Ji-Patten snapped, taking two steps toward Styke.\nStyke entered the courtyard, but only just, leaning against the kitchen\nwall and cocking his head at Ji-Patten. He didn’t have to pretend a yawn. It\ncame naturally, and he made no gesture to stifle it. “How’s your leg?”\nThe dragonman’s nostrils flared, but he didn’t rise to the bait. “What did\nyou say to your men the other day?” he demanded.\nStyke raised both eyebrows. “I asked them how they’d been treated.”\n“What else?”\n“That’s it.”\n“Liar.”\nStyke sniffed and turned to Etzi. “What is this?”\nEtzi frowned at the dragonman, then turned that frown on Styke.\n“They’re making serious accusations, Ben. I suggest you handle them\nrespectfully.”\n“From him?” Styke jerked his chin at Ji-Patten.\n“From him,” Etzi confirmed, clearly reluctant to do so. “He is an agent\nof the emperor.”\nStyke yawned again and stood up straight, dropping a half bow toward\nJi-Patten. “O mighty dragonman, what are you so angry about this\nmorning?”\n“Ben!” Etzi hissed.\n“I will not allow you to goad me, foreigner,” Ji-Patten growled. “If the\nlaws didn’t prevent it, I would teach you respect.”\n“You think you can do that with six men?” Styke asked, jerking his head\ntoward the guardsmen behind Ji-Patten. He was beginning to get annoyed\nhimself. “You want a bigger limp? Is that what you want?” He caught\nhimself, remembering Celine’s words—remembering that he was a guest\nhere. Gritting his teeth, he snapped his head back and forced down his own\nrising ire. Etzi’s scowl deepened, and Styke held up one hand to forestall\nwhatever he was about to say.\n“I apologize,” Styke growled. “Not enough sleep, you see? What can I\ndo for the Servant of the Emperor?”\nEtzi took a deep breath, nodding at Styke’s apology and then turning\nexpectantly to the dragonman. Ji-Patten’s eyes remained narrowed, but he\nbit back his tone when he next spoke. “One of your men has escaped.”\n“Oh?” Styke asked, trying to sound surprised.\n“The Palo. During the changing of the guard at midnight. No one\nnoticed until just an hour ago.”\n“Have you bothered to look for him?”\n“Of course. We’re scouring the city and widening our net. He will be\nfound. What I want to know is what you said to him the other day.”\n“I already told you,” Styke insisted. “I inquired whether they were being\ntreated well. Nothing more. I didn’t have time to before your guards hustled\nme out.”\n“If you had nothing to do with this, then you must help us find him,” Ji-\nPatten said. “He must be returned to his cell until this… suit of yours has\nbeen resolved.” His eyes darted briefly to Etzi."

Neither of us knows anything about this place. I don’t\nknow why he escaped—certainly not on my orders—but he should be easy\nenough to find.” Styke narrowed his eyes. “How do I know that you haven’t\nsnatched him yourself?”\nJi-Patten looked taken aback.\nStyke pushed on. “You’ve already shown that you have no problem\nmurdering an old woman in a nighttime ambush. What’s to say you didn’t\nsnatch one of my men to take him off for questioning?” Styke feared that\nperhaps he was right. What if Sedial’s men had snatched Jackal before he\nwas able to escape, and had taken him away to be questioned by bone-eyes?\nHe’d have to check with Ka-poel to see if she was protecting Jackal.\n“That’s preposterous,” Ji-Patten objected. It was clear he wasn’t used to\nbeing confronted in such a manner. As a dragonman, he probably expected\neveryone to bow and scrape—even the Household heads.\n“It better be,” Styke said. “I protect my men. You find him—for his own\nsafety—or you’ll have me to answer to.” Despite his fears, he grinned\ninwardly. Too bad Celine couldn’t see him now. Terrible actor—bah.\nJi-Patten looked from Styke to Etzi and then back at Styke. “Damn you\nboth. There will be consequences for this.” He pointed a finger at Styke.\n“The first is this: As an agent of the emperor, I bar you from seeing the\nforeign prisoners until this suit is over.” He whirled suddenly and strode out\nthrough the open gate, heading toward the horses waiting at the other end of\nthe long causeway. Styke noticed that his limp was less pronounced, as if it\nwas healing quickly, and he thought of the sorcery that had kept Orz from\ndying due to a punctured lung. If they did end up fighting, that wound\nwould not give Styke as much of an advantage as he wanted.\nThe compound gate was soon closed, and Etzi ran a hand across his\nface. He was clearly exhausted, his cheeks flushed, bags beneath his eyes,\nand hair mussed. He took several long breaths before turning to Styke.\n“What…,” he began, then held up a hand. “Never mind. I don’t want to\nknow.” He stepped forward and said in a voice low enough not to be\noverheard by his guardsmen. “One of your horses went missing. Two hours\nago. The boy watching the stables said that it just disappeared. Do you\nknow anything about that?”\n“No,” Styke answered. How Jackal had managed to slip into the stables\nand out again on a warhorse without waking anyone up was beyond him.\n“Good.” Etzi let out a shaky breath. “I hope whatever you’re doing is\nworth not speaking to your men again. This will make my task more\ndifficult.”\n“I’m not doing anything,” Styke said. The words came out dull and\nheavy. Not very convincing."

Not very convincing.\n“Of course not,” Etzi said, waving the subject off. “I’m going back to\nbed. I suggest you do the same.”\nStyke followed Etzi’s suggestion, returning to the guest room, where he\nfound both Ka-poel and Celine sitting up in bed. He removed his shirt and\nsat down on his own, yawning. “Do you have anything on that Ji-Patten?”\nhe asked Ka-poel.\nShe shook her head and gestured. Dragonmen are more cautious about\nnot leaving behind detritus for bone-eyes. Styke didn’t need Celine to\ntranslate.\n“Makes sense. Well, if you get the opportunity don’t hesitate. That\nbastard is starting to annoy me.”\nKa-poel pressed her lips into a hard line. I am spread thin.\n“So you can’t help?”\nI’ll do what I can. But a dragonman is harder because of the sorcery\nthat gives him his strength.\n“How about my Lancers?” Styke asked. “If they are questioned by a\nbone-eye, can you keep them from being compelled to answer?”\nThat tight-lipped expression turned up into a wicked little smile. They’ve\nalready tried.\n“And you didn’t tell me?” Styke took in a sharp breath and swore.\nThey were… unsuccessful. And quite baffled as to why.\nStyke frowned. “Good. Wait. Could this tip your hand to Ka-Sedial? He\ndoesn’t know you’re here, but if he finds out…”\nI understand. I’m being very cautious.\n“I hope so.” Styke looked at Celine. “You should go back to sleep, little\none.”\n“I will,” she yawned. “Are you going to fight Ji-Patten?”\n“Maybe.”\n“Don’t let him kill you.”\n“I don’t intend to.”\nCeline got up and joined Styke, sitting on the edge of his bed and putting\nher head in the crook of his arm. Her expression was very serious. “I mean\nit. You’re not allowed to let him kill you.”\n“How do you like the kids here?” Styke asked, changing the subject.\n“They’re fun,” Celine said dismissively. “A lot nicer than the kids in\nLandfall. Jerio is my favorite, though.” Her tone became suddenly excited\nat the mention of his name. “He’s very clever. And very funny, too. He\ndoesn’t let the bigger kids bully him. They’re almost as afraid of him as\nthey are of me.”\n“Why is that?”\n“Because he doesn’t back down.” She scowled. “That’s not allowed\nhere.”\n“Here?”\nKa-poel’s hands flashed from across the room. Styke nodded to her to\nrepeat herself. She means in this society.\n“Ah. People here aren’t allowed to stand up for themselves?” he asked\nCeline.\nShe waggled her head from one side to the other. “Kind of? It’s not that\nthey can’t, it’s just that they’re expected to do what they’re told by people\nstronger or more powerful than them. I heard one of the adults call Jerio a\ntroublemaker because he thinks for himself.”"

There were levels to the politics here that he could only\nsense on the edges of his awareness. Etzi was more confident with those\nlevels, and Celine seemed to have already sussed them out. He wondered, if\nall of them survived this war, whether he should let Celine spend time with\nLindet. They would either love or loathe each other. Celine certainly was\nalready showing she had a mind closer to Lindet’s than his own.\nHe took a deep breath, thinking of Orz’s words the other day—the\npromise he’d requested of Styke to fight and kill Ji-Patten. “If something\nhappens to me, I want you to keep your head down. Survive.”\nCeline squeezed his hand and said in a sleepy voice, “Don’t worry, I\nwill. But nothing is going to happen to you, Ben. You’re too strong.”\nStyke looked across at Ka-poel. She wore a small smile, gazing at\nCeline. The moment she noticed Styke’s glance, the smile disappeared and\nshe lay down, rolling over to put her back to him. He wondered, not for the\nfirst time, what she was up to every day. Biding her time. Making plans.\nPreparing for that storm he sensed on the horizon.\nProbably making better use of her time than carving a wooden army for\nthe Household kids. Styke leaned back in bed, letting Celine settle against\nhis shoulder. She soon dozed off, filling the room with her soft snores.\nStyke was awakened again by a knock on the door. He gently slid Celine\noff his shoulder and padded over to answer it, only to find Etzi standing\noutside. One of his guards was shadowing him, something that Styke hadn’t\nseen before.\nEtzi wore a worried frown. He looked up at Styke, hesitating a moment,\nthen said, “There is nothing you can do, but I wanted to let you know that\nSedial’s counterattack has begun.”\n“In what form?” Styke asked.\n“Mobs,” Etzi said. “They began this morning. They’re roaming the city,\nposing as discontented laborers angry about the foreigners in the city.\nSeveral slaves were caught and lynched.”\n“You’re sure this has to do with us?”\n“I have no proof,” Etzi said, “but I am certain.

All of them belonged to my Household.”\n“Shit,” Styke breathed.\n“Yes. Yes indeed. It has begun, Ben Styke. I would like to say that you\nare safe within the compound, but… sleep with your knife at your side.”\nCHAPTER 43\nM\nichel finished his morning’s work and retired to a small, dark pub not\nfar from Mama Palo’s headquarters, where he ordered a drink and kicked\nhis feet up onto the chair opposite. He’d worked nonstop for almost thirty\nhours, but for the first time in weeks he felt like he was getting somewhere;\nSurvivor and his young wards were now the talk of the Palo slums, telling\ntheir stories of horror to anyone who would listen.\nAnd, it seemed, everyone wanted to listen. Grumbling spread as fast as\nword of mouth. Thousands of Palo had already begun to abandon the\nmilitary training camps outside the city. Hundreds of laborers had quit their\njobs in protest. Community leaders were demanding answers about this\ncitadel-under-construction and the godstone within it.\nMichel and Mama Palo’s people worked tirelessly behind the scenes to\nstoke the fire. They produced propaganda, took meetings with community\nleaders, and whispered in all the right ears.\nThe Dynize, for their part, barely seemed to have noticed anything was\nwrong. The stories had been circulating for less than two days. Michel\nwondered how long the Dynize would remain in ignorance—and then how\nlong after that until they responded. The response, he knew, could come in\nmany different forms: violence, denials, cover-ups, or combinations thereof.\nHe and Jiniel were working on contingency plans for whatever the Dynize\ndecided to do. He hoped it was enough.\nHe had to believe it would be enough.\n“Have you seen this?”\nHe jumped as a newspaper was thrown down on the table in front of him\nand realized that he’d been half asleep in his chair. Ichtracia sat down\nacross from him, taking the beer that he hadn’t even noticed had been\ndelivered, and draining half of it. He rubbed his eyes and yawned, turning\nthe newspaper so that it faced him. Before he’d had a chance to read more\nthan the main headline, Ichtracia snatched it back and began to read. Her\neyes moved furiously across the lines for several moments.\n“Are you going to let me see it?” Michel finally asked.\nShe handed the newspaper back and turned away. Michel watched the\nside of her face for a few moments. Her jaw was clenched and a vein stood\nout above her cheek. Something had clearly set her on edge. Was it the\nnewspaper article?\n“Your fomentation is working,” she said. “The Palo are going nuts.”\n“You don’t sound happy about that.”\n“It’s working too well, I think.” Ichtracia tapped the newspaper. “A Palo\nwoman was caught defacing the capital building. She wrote We will never\nbe slaves again in horse blood in very large letters.”\nMichel skimmed over the details of the article. He wondered if it was\none of Jiniel’s operatives or just someone inflamed by all these rumors."

He wondered if it was\none of Jiniel’s operatives or just someone inflamed by all these rumors.\nEither way, the culprit had been thrown into prison. The newspaper claimed\nthat she was a madwoman and would be dealt with leniently, but that the\nDynize city guard would be more active the next couple of weeks. He\npushed the newspaper away and looked up at Ichtracia again. She fidgeted,\nnot meeting his eyes.\n“Are you all right?” he asked.\n“It’s barely been any time at all. I’ve been reading the reports going\nacross Jiniel’s desk. These stories have been circulating for, what, a day and\na half at best? And people are already defacing buildings and throwing\nrocks. I heard there’s supposed to be a march across Upper Landfall in just\na couple hours.”\nMichel ran his tongue along his teeth. That was new, and not one of his\nplans. Jiniel might have organized it. “The stories are true. In the right\npolitical atmosphere, truth has wings.”\n“It doesn’t matter if they’re true or not. What shocks me is that people\nare eating it up so quickly. I know you’re good at what you do, Michel, but\nyou’re not that good.”\nMichel stifled a smile. “Your point?”\n“Then, what is it? The Palo were singing Dynize praises just a few days\nago, and now they’re on the edge of rioting.”\nMichel considered the question for a few moments. “You have to\nunderstand our people. We’ve been put down and kicked around for so long\nthat we were desperate for relief—any relief. Lindet and her Blackhats had\nus terrified into inaction, and for good reason. She was brutal. So when the\nDynize came along and treated us so well, we took it without asking too\nmany questions. What’s that old saying? Don’t look a gift horse in the\nmouth?”\n“It’s ‘Don’t look at a gift goat’s hooves’ in Dynize,” Ichtracia replied. “I\nget your meaning. But you haven’t answered my question.”\nMichel tapped the side of his head. “We didn’t turn our noses up at a\ngift. But we’ve also been burned before—dozens of times in living memory.\nEveryone you see around us here in the Depths, we all loved the Dynize\ntreatment. But we were all thinking the same thing: Everyone else has\nbetrayed us. When will the Dynize? We Palo were all just waiting for the\nDynize to show their true colors. And now that they have, we’re pissed\nabout it.”\n“As simple as that?”\n“As simple as that,” Michel confirmed. “That anger is exactly what\nwe’re trying to stoke.”\n“Like I said. I think it’s working too well.”\nMichel pursed his lips. “Why?”\nIchtracia shifted uncertainly. “It’s changing so fast. I’m worried what\nSedial will do when he finally grasps the situation. He can be a subtle man,\nbut not when he’s taken by surprise.”\n“Honestly, I’m worried about that myself.” Michel drank the rest of his\nbeer and pushed it to the edge of the table. “Is that what’s bothering you?”"

It was the stack\nof envelopes she’d claimed from those reports stolen from the dragonman’s\nhome.\n“You broke the wards already?” Michel asked in surprise.\n“Sedial thinks his favorite Privileged are the best at everything. They’re\nnot great at wards.”\n“You’re better?”\n“Enough to only need a day to pick through them. Once I unwrapped\none, the rest were easy.” Ichtracia smiled, but it came across as pained.\n“You going to look at them?”\nMichel kept his eyes on her as he picked up the top envelope and flipped\nit open, finally looking down. The lettering was neat, and he knew enough\nabout Dynize to recognize the tone as formal. He read through it slowly,\ntranslating the words as he went, his hackles rising with each new line. It\nsaid:\nBy Order of the Great Ka, Written with the Full Authority of the\nEmperor of Dynize\nAt the appointed hour, the bearer of this order is given authority\nto execute a complete and utter purge against the Household of\nYaret. All men, women, and children in the immediate Household are\nto be put to death. All ancillary Household members will be branded\nas slaves and scattered to the wind. All possessions will be seized and\nall dwellings razed. The name of Yaret will be struck from Imperial\nrecord.\nThe execution of this sentence is the will of the Emperor, for the\ngood of His domain. Any who question it will be scattered with the\noffending Household.\nMichel inhaled sharply and read it again. “Did I translate this right?”\n“It’s a purge order targeting Yaret and his Household.”\n“I did, then.” He set the envelope down. “Why Yaret?” was the first\nthing he managed to say. “Was it because of me?”\n“You?” It seemed to take Ichtracia a moment to realize that Michel was\nblaming the purge order on his infiltration of the Yaret Household. “Oh, no.\nNot at all. Sedial and Yaret have always hated each other. Look at the date\non the top right-hand corner. This was written before the invasion fleet left\nDynize, and it’s signed by the emperor. Besides, look at the rest of the\nenvelopes.”\nMichel began to pick them up, one at a time, reading through them\nquickly. Each one was a copy of the former—only the names were changed\nto target a different Household. When he realized that they were all\nidentical, he stopped bothering to read and instead just counted the pile.\nThere were twenty-three in total. Everything clicked. “These are all of\nSedial’s Dynize enemies, aren’t they?”\nIchtracia gave him a small nod. “The ones in Landfall, yes. It’s\nthorough, too.

There are a few names missing, but I’m\nnot sure if that means he’s decided to spare those Households or if he’s just\nhanded the purge orders to a different lieutenant. My guess is the latter.”\nMichel swore and checked the execution date again. Just nine days\naway. He took several deep breaths, forcing aside his sudden worry, trying\nto detach himself from the situation. He needed to think about this\nrationally. He could use this—the Palo cause could use this. If there was to\nbe a purge, it would throw the Dynize into chaos and the Palo could rise up\nand…\nHe felt his thoughts circling, unable to focus. He rubbed the bridge of\nhis nose.\nShit.\n“You should probably head back to headquarters,” he told Ichtracia,\nleaving money for his beer and gathering all the purge orders into his bag.\nShe didn’t move. “What are you going to do?”\n“You sound worried,” Michel said, giving her a soft smile.\n“And you look resigned. I don’t like it.”\nMichel suddenly felt so tired. It wasn’t his usual exhaustion, either, but\nsomething deeper. It was the same thing he’d felt that night when he was\nconfronted by Tenik, and confessed that he worked for the Palo. It was the\npain of being so many people at once. He realized why Ichtracia had been\nso on edge: She knew what he’d do when he saw the orders. He closed his\neyes for a moment, leaning on the table until he could gather his resolve.\n“You can’t go to Yaret,” Ichtracia told him gently. “You’ll risk\neverything.”\n“I’m not stupid,” Michel replied, pushing himself away from the table\nand heading toward the door. He could hear Ichtracia swear under her\nbreath and run to catch up to him. She fell in beside him outside, and the\ntwo of them trudged through the haphazard dripping caused by rain\ntrickling down through the myriad roofs and gutters in Greenfire Depths.\nMichel headed up to the rim of the Depths, deep in thought, fighting the\npowerful urge of self-preservation that told him to turn around and head\nright back down there and figure out a different way to use the purge orders.\nHe crossed Upper Landfall, entered the capital district, and found one of\nthe Palo street kids that had become de facto spies and runners for several\nof the large Households up here. With Ichtracia hiding in an alley nearby, he\nbeckoned the kid over and held up a two-krana coin.\n“Do you know where the Yaret Household is?”\nThe child nodded seriously. Through the layer of grime on his face,\nMichel could barely tell he was Palo—or whether he was actually a she. He\ndropped the coin in the kid’s hand, then gave him a hastily scrawled note. “I\nwant you to deliver this to Tenik in the Yaret Household. Tell him that\nyou’re to be paid twenty krana for your troubles.”\nThe kid’s eyes widened. He snatched the note from Michel and took off\nrunning without asking any more questions.

She lifted an\neyebrow at him as he fell in beside her. “Evening.”\n“Evening,” he replied, taking her by the arm. “The first of Delia’s\nemissaries has returned—with company.”\n“Shit. This soon? It’s only been two days.”\n“Three days.”\n“Who is it?”\n“General Etepali.”\n“Herself?”\n“Yup.”\nVlora let out a string of curses. “I thought Etepali was still burying\nbodies back at the Cape of New Adopest.”\n“Turns out she’s been following us about ten miles back.”\n“Of course she has. She’s here already?”\n“The first of Delia’s little summits,” Bo confirmed. “Started five\nminutes ago in Delia’s tent.”\nVlora changed directions, nearly losing her grip on her sword and falling\nflat on her face. She recovered thanks to Bo’s arm and began heading\ntoward the corner of the camp where Delia’s High Provosts had pitched\ntheir tents. Bo went along with her in silence, with Norrine trailing along\nbehind them.\nAs they approached the edge of camp, Bo asked, “Do you expect to be\npresent at every one of Delia’s meetings?”\n“Haven’t decided yet.”\n“She’s not going to like that.”\n“I don’t care. Besides, I want her on her toes. I don’t trust her worth shit,\nand…” Vlora fell silent as she maneuvered around a couple of campfires\nand approached a large tent marked with the emblem of the High Provosts.\nA handful of Dynize officers and their bodyguards milled outside the tent\nwith an equal number of provosts. The provosts shuffled into Vlora’s path\nas she approached.\n“Sorry, ma’am, this summit is for the special envoy and her guests\nonly,” one of them said.\n“Move.”\n“Sorry, ma’am, I—”\nVlora cut him off in a quiet voice. “Lay a hand on me and I’ll make sure\nthat your bodies are never found. Move.”\nThe lead provost cleared his throat, looked at his companions, then\nstepped aside.\n“Thank you,” she said to him sweetly. “Borbador, why don’t you keep\nthese gentlemen entertained?” Loosening herself from Bo’s arm, she swept\ninside the tent."

        "text": "stepped aside.\n“Thank you,” she said to him sweetly. “Borbador, why don’t you keep\nthese gentlemen entertained?” Loosening herself from Bo’s arm, she swept\ninside the tent.\nThere were only four people inside: Delia, Valeer, Etepali, and one of\nEtepali’s senior officers. The group seemed like they had only recently\nseated themselves, and they looked up in surprise as Vlora entered. Delia’s\neyes narrowed slightly and Valeer looked openly indignant. “Lady Flint—”\nhe began.\n“I’m sorry I’m late,” Vlora cut him off. She looked around for a fifth\nchair, found one in the corner of the tent, and dragged it over to the group\nbefore falling gratefully into it. “Evening inspections take a long time, you\nknow?”\nThe glares from her two political “allies” were unmistakable, and Vlora\nsaw the cool look that Etepali gave all three of them. She wondered, briefly,\nif this had been a mistake. Even a fool could feel the tension between the\nAdrans, and Etepali was no fool. She was probably already trying to figure\nout how to exploit this internal rift. None of this showed on her face, of\ncourse, and she raised a glass to Vlora. “My dear Lady Flint. It’s so good to\nsee you. Has your health been improving?”\n“Yes, thank you.”\n“Excellent. I’m very pleased to hear that.”\n“I must confess, I didn’t expect you to catch up with us so quickly,”\nVlora said.\nEtepali’s companion scowled, but Etepali herself just smiled pleasantly.\n“There were a lot of bodies to bury, of course, but there is still a war on. I\nleft some of my auxiliaries to take care of the cleanup.”\n“Still hoping to drink that bottle of spirits?”\n“I’ll carry it with me until we have the chance to share it.” Whatever\neffect the Midnight Massacre had had on the morale of the Dynize, it didn’t\nseem to have touched Etepali. Vlora felt her own smile slipping, so she\nturned back to Delia.\n“Sorry, Delia. Don’t let me interrupt. I’m just here to observe the peace\ntalks.”\nA pregnant pause hung in the room before Delia reached across the table\nbeside her and shuffled a pile of papers and notes. She cleared her throat,\ngaze lingering on Vlora, before turning to Etepali. “As I was saying before\nLady Flint arrived, I want to thank you so much for answering my request\nfor a meeting.”\n“Of course,” Etepali responded, swirling the liquid in her glass. “I’ve\nonly just become acquainted with Adran liquor, but I find myself enamored.\nI wouldn’t miss it for anything.”\nDelia blinked back at the old woman for a moment. “Yes, well. I’d like\nto lay out the initial plan to bring the Adran theater of this war to a close.”\n“So soon?” Etepali seemed surprised. “You’ve only just arrived.”\n“Indeed we have, but our purpose here is not to wage war. It is, rather, to\nmake sure that Adran interests in this part of the world are upheld.”"

        "text": "“Indeed we have, but our purpose here is not to wage war. It is, rather, to\nmake sure that Adran interests in this part of the world are upheld.”\nEtepali leaned forward. “I’m sorry. What, exactly, are Adran interests in\nthis part of the world? I understood that you don’t actually own any of\nFatrasta anymore.”\n“We don’t,” Delia replied with a tight smile. “But we do have a trade\nalliance with Fatrasta—one that has been disrupted badly by your capture of\nso many Fatrastan cities.”\n“I wasn’t aware that a trade alliance with Adro warranted such a heavy\nresponse. A whole field army, just over some trade routes! My heavens, I’m\ncertain that the Great Ka would have rethought the entire invasion if he had\nan inkling that a Kressian nation would intercede on behalf of the\nFatrastans.”\nVlora couldn’t quite tell whether Etepali was being sarcastic or not. She\nspoke in that tone that so many old women are able to master—part\ncondescending, part sincere, part baffled. Vlora watched Delia carefully to\nsee how she’d respond.\nDelia shuffled her papers again. “We’re not, strictly, intervening on\nbehalf of the Fatrastans.”\n“Oh?” Etepali exclaimed. Definitely sarcasm.\n“This is about the so-called godstones,” Delia said.\n“I see. Well, I wouldn’t know anything about those.”\n“You wouldn’t?” Delia asked in surprise.\n“I know about them,” Etepali admitted. “But I don’t have any orders to\ndeal with them in any capacity. In fact, I don’t actually have any orders to\ndeal with you, either. My last order from the Great Ka was to capture the\ncity of New Adopest. By all rights, I should have headed right back there\nthe moment Lady Flint left us behind her to clean up the Midnight\nMassacre.”\n“So why aren’t you?” Vlora spoke up.\n“I’m a general,” Etepali replied. “I may follow orders, but I can also\ntake some initiative. I’ve deemed an Adran field army to be of greater\nimportance than a small coastal city.”\nDelia frowned at Etepali. “When you say that you don’t have orders…”\n“To deal with you? I should have said, rather, that I don’t have any\nauthority to deal with you.” Etepali shrugged. “I have absolutely no\npolitical autonomy. None of us generals do, unless we’re accompanied by\none of the Great Ka’s adjuncts.”\nDelia became visibly deflated, while Valeer scowled at both Etepali and\nVlora. “Do you mean,” Delia asked, “that this is a waste of time?”\n“I’m afraid so,” Etepali said, draining the last drop from her cup and\nleaning forward to pat Delia on the knee. “It’s nothing personal, of course.\nYou and your friend here seem very lovely. And General Flint, of course,\nthough I should probably be bitter about her maneuver back there on the\nCape.” She got up and walked over to a small table in the corner, where she\npoured herself another glass.\n“I have a question that I believe you can answer,” Vlora said, taking"

According to the survivors, a Dynize army has\nbeen murdering Kressians and kidnapping Palo. What do you know of\nthat?”\nEtepali’s composure was broken, if only for a moment. She covered for\nherself by taking a sip from her glass. “Nothing.”\n“You’re certain?” Vlora asked.\n“Certain. As I said, every army has different orders.” Etepali shrugged.\nSilence blanketed the room. Etepali’s officer and Provost Marshal Valeer\nstared at each other. Delia glared at the papers in her lap. Etepali drank her\nsecond, then third glass. Vlora tried to watch everyone at once.\nFinally, Etepali gave a tiny, happy burp and set her glass down. “Well\nnow. I’m afraid I’m not much use to you. You’ll have to wait for your\nemissaries to return from Landfall. Thank you so much for the drink,\nthough. Have a good evening!” With a wave, Etepali was joined by her\nofficer and left the room. Within a few minutes, her group had departed,\njudging from the sounds outside, leaving Delia’s tent silent.\nVlora cleaned her nails on her jacket. “Don’t take it too badly,” she said\nto Delia. “She did the same thing to me out on the Cape. I’m pretty sure she\ninitiates these meetings just to find out the character of her enemies.”\nDelia remained quiet for a few moments before her head jerked up. “You\nare not authorized to be here,” she snapped.\nVlora pretended to be surprised by the outburst. “I’m the commanding\nofficer of this army. I am authorized to be anywhere I want.”\n“And I’m the head of the Adran special envoy! I—”\n“Don’t,” Vlora warned. “You won’t win this argument. It’s been fifty\nyears since a commanding officer has been subordinate to a special envoy,\nand there’s nothing in Adran law that changes that. You’re welcome to\nmake overtures, and you’re welcome to try and stop this war. But my word\nhere is still final. Strategic necessity trumps political maneuvering.”\n“You’re saying that as if you can do whatever you want,” Delia accused.\n“No, I’m not,” Vlora said flatly. “You’re here now, there’s nothing I can\ndo about that. I’ll let you do your job. But I have to be allowed to do all of\nmine—and one of those is making sure that you don’t endanger the lives of\nmy soldiers in the course of your negotiations.”\n“Do you expect to stand over my shoulder throughout all of this?”\n“I certainly hope not. I don’t have the energy.” Vlora wished she could\ntake more pleasure in Delia’s anger. And she did take a little, to be sure. But\nshe also knew that this was but a momentary setback for Delia.

Within the\nnext few weeks, she’d make proper contact with Ka-Sedial, and when that\nhappened, Vlora couldn’t be certain how the wind would blow. She stood\nup, giving a small bow to Valeer and Delia. “I want to suggest something.”\n“What?” The word came from Delia in a half snarl.\n“I want to suggest we put aside our differences and work through this\nconflict. This expedition could be used to greatly enhance Adran wealth and\nprestige.”\nDelia became very still, regarding Vlora suspiciously.\nVlora took this as an opportunity to continue. “We’ve landed a field\narmy in the middle of a conflict. We’re greatly outnumbered, but we have\nthe best-armed and best-trained troops on the continent. We can use our\nposition to leverage concessions out of both Fatrasta and Dynize. Money,\ntrade, even land. The Fatrastans are on the back foot. The Dynize are\noverextended. A skilled politician should be able to exploit that. Barter a\npeace, and break off a chunk for Adro in the process. Pit, if we can do that\nbefore any of the rest of the Nine is forced to get involved to protect their\ninterests in this hemisphere, we might even be lauded as heroes.”\nVlora could see the gears turning in Delia’s head. Her suspicion slowly\nfaded, replaced with a haughty coldness. She regarded Vlora with pursed\nlips. “I’ll take it under advisement.”\nHaughty coldness was about the best Vlora could hope to expect out of\nDelia. “Of course. Thank you. And in the future, if you’ll give me some\nwarning, then either I or my representative will be on time for these\nmeetings. And I might be able to share information with you that keeps you\nfrom wasting your time.”\nDelia gave her a tight nod. Vlora took it as a sign that it was time to\nleave. She made her good-byes and slipped out, where she found Bo\nsurrounded by provosts. The whole group burst into laughter as she headed\ntoward them. She pried him from their midst and, still shadowed by\nNorrine, they headed back toward her tent. “What was that all about?” she\nasked.\n“I was telling jokes,” Bo said.\n“By Adom.” Vlora sighed.\n“Oh, come on. Even you find the one about the Kressian priest and the\nWarden a little funny.”\nShe rolled her eyes. “The summit was a no-go. Etepali drank Delia’s\nliquor and then told her that she had no authority to negotiate.”\n“I can’t help but wonder what her angle is,” Bo said.\n“Etepali? I think she’s crafty and bored. Regardless, Delia was furious,\nbut I did manage to plant a seed in her head.”\n“Oh?”\n“Suggesting we can work together to use this expedition to enrich\nAdro.”\n“Think she’ll go for it?”\n“Maybe. I’m just trying to keep her distracted. Whatever happens, I’m\nnot leaving this continent without the second godstone and, hopefully,\nSedial’s head.”"

The pipe began to smoke\nimmediately and he gave her a grin. “This will be fun.”\nCHAPTER 45\nE\ntzi wrung his hands in the first show of genuine nerves since Styke had\narrived at the compound. Both men were in the compound stables, just\nacross the courtyard from the kitchens. Etzi paced in the straw, while Styke\nrummaged through his saddlebags that hung from a crossbeam outside\nAmrec’s stall. He paused in his rummaging to reach over the door and let\nAmrec nuzzle his hand, patting the warhorse on the nose before returning to\nhis search.\nAs Etzi paced, his face drawn up into a focused frown, he grumbled, “I\ndon’t know why they’re summoning you to the Quorum Hall.”\n“So you’ve said,” Styke replied, finally finding the wax-paper package\nthat contained his carefully folded dress uniform. He set it on the floor,\nunwrapped it, and checked the cloth for stains or damage. “Can someone\niron these?” he asked.\n“Gorlia!” Etzi barked. A stable girl detached herself from a pile of hay at\nthe end of the stables and ran to attention. “Are your hands clean? Good.\nTake these to the steward. They must be ready in thirty minutes.” The stable\ngirl took off, and Etzi resumed his pacing. “There should be no need for\nyour presence. Ji-Patten is going to try something. I can sense it.”\nStyke laced both arms over the stall door and scratched Amrec’s cheeks.\nEtzi’s disquiet filled the building, but his own was no less present. He’d\nnever been good with politicians, officers, or any sort of authority figures.\nNot one-on-one, and much less so in groups. Yet they’d summoned him to\nstand before the Household Quorum. According to Etzi, everyone who was\nanyone would be there: five hundred or so Household heads or ranking\nrepresentatives, all present to gawk at the foreign giant being protected by\none of their own.\nThe whole idea made him want to break something.\n“Anything I need to know before I go up there?”\nEtzi flinched. “You cannot—I emphasize, cannot speak to the\nHousehold Quorum the same way you spoke to Ji-Patten. We are a people\nsteeped in tradition and decorum. For a foreigner to even enter into the\nQuorum Hall is uncalled for, but if you so much as raise your voice…”\n“Then what? They’ll have me whipped?”\nEtzi sniffed. “We’re not barbarians. Half the people in that room have\nalready formed an opinion about you. Of those, they can be divided\nbetween Sedial’s allies, who have been told what to think, and Sedial’s\nenemies, who hope to use you.”\n“And the rest?”\n“The rest are those I hope to influence.

They’ll be curious what the friend of\na dragonman looks like.”\nStyke turned around, leaning against the stall door. Amrec nibbled at his\near. “Would this be easier if I just called Ji-Patten out?”\n“Eh?”\n“A duel. Can I just have some sort of trial by combat?”\nEtzi’s eyes widened. “No! No,” he repeated again, shaking his head.\n“That’s not how we do things here. Remember that dragonmen are the\nproperty of the emperor. Attempting to duel one would be like calling out\ngod himself. Do that, and they’ll think you a savage.” He held up a finger.\n“Pretend that you’re speaking with your own governing body.”\nStyke bit his tongue and nodded.\nEtzi went on. “Speak when spoken to. Ji-Patten knows you are a man of\nviolence. He may even try to provoke you into attacking him.”\n“I can’t rise to his provocations?”\n“No. This is important.” A flurry of emotions crossed Etzi’s face. “It is\nmore important than you can imagine. Any violence in the Quorum Hall\nwill be taken as an affront to the members. I know that I don’t tell you\nmuch, and that you are confined to this place, but you have to understand:\nThere is a war of ideals taking place within the Household Quorum right\nnow. My lawsuit has unleashed something larger than I imagined, and may\nvery well shake the foundations of Sedial’s power.”\nStyke intertwined his fingers to hide his own nerves. He’d rather charge\nfive hundred soldiers alone than stand in front of them, expected to be a\ncompliant little child. “You think this will be that important?”\nEtzi didn’t hesitate before he nodded, and his face was so earnest that\nStyke felt as if he had no choice but to believe him.\n“All right,” Styke said. “I’ll be on my best behavior. Have one of the\nboys saddle my horse. Where do I find the steward to get my uniform?”\nStyke rode in the center of Etzi’s Household guard—three dozen soldiers in\nbreastplates, morion helmets, and white-and-turquoise uniforms in a\nslightly different style than those of the city guard or regular soldiery. Etzi\nrode at his side with his head high and his gaze cool, all trace of nerves left\nback in the stable. Styke followed his example. He wore his dress uniform,\nan outfit he’d brought with a mind bent toward accepting the surrender of\nan enemy army, not attending a trial.\nHe gripped his reins with his white gloves, half wishing he’d brought the\nskull-and-lance banner and flown it from his lance. But he was not here to\nintimidate. He was here to grin at Ji-Patten, answer a few questions, and go\non his way. Respectful. A tad arrogant—but not too much so.

        "text": "Friend of the pardoned dragonman, Orz.\nHe’d dismissed Etzi’s earlier claims that Styke had become some kind of\ncelebrity, but reassessed them in light of the crowds. The route from Etzi’s\nHousehold to the Quorum Hall was packed. People gawked from the\nstreets, windows, and rooftops. They waved handkerchiefs at him. They\ncalled him names. A thrown piece of fruit barely missed his head, and at\nanother point three pretty young women appeared in a window wearing\nnext to nothing, calling to him in broken Adran.\nA city divided indeed.\nThey rode up the main thoroughfare toward the palace complex, but\ntook a sharp left before coming within the shadow of the godstone. Their\npath crossed a wide square of tiled marble, approaching a building of\nimmense, dusty red stones whose face stretched across the entire side of the\nsquare and more beyond. A mighty archway led inside. Styke followed\nEtzi’s lead, dismounting and giving Amrec’s reins to one of the Household\nstable boys.\n“Are you ready?” Etzi asked.\nThe question only caused Styke’s nerves to jump. He forced himself to\ngrin. “Of course.”\nEtzi gave a curt nod and led Styke through the archway and down a long\nhall. Styke removed his hat, holding it under one arm, feeling the reassuring\ncadence of his cavalry sword slapping against his thigh. Their footsteps\nechoed in a silence, disturbed only by a distant roar. The roar grew in\nintensity with every step. They turned at the end of the hall, walked through\nanother archway, and the roar resolved itself into the sound of hundreds of\npeople speaking over one another in a huge concert hall.\nThe hall was shaped like an amphitheater, with seats rising up in three\ndirections from a platform of white marble. They had entered directly onto\nthat platform, and Styke suspected that the distinct feeling of smallness\nimposed by the high-domed ceiling, the rising seats, and the crowd that\nhushed upon his entry was all thoroughly engineered.\nThe sudden silence left him with an imagined echo in his ears. He stood\nstiffly at attention, back straight, trying to remember the last time he’d\nbothered to show the respect of parade posture to an audience. During\ntraining, maybe?\n“Meln-Etzi,” Etzi presented himself in a soft voice. The voice carried\nclearly throughout the room, not requiring him to speak any louder. “I\npresent to the Household Quorum my guest, Colonel Ben of Fatrasta,\ncompanion of my brother, Ji-Orz.”\nContinued silence.\nEtzi gave a small frown. “I was instructed to present him here?”\n“You were,” a voice boomed.\nStyke glanced to his right to find Ji-Patten stepping up onto the\nspeaker’s platform, about ten paces from Styke. The dragonman seemed in\nhis element, an easy smile on his face, something strangely triumphant in\nhis eyes. Styke was momentarily confused, and then his eyes fell upon a\ngroup sitting at the front of the audience just over Ji-Patten’s shoulder.\nIt was his men, all twenty—or nineteen rather, without Jackal—of his\nLancers.

The Lancers returned his gaze with curious ones of their\nown. Even without exchanging a word, Styke could feel their nervousness\nand confusion. They didn’t know why they were here any more than he did.\nEtzi bowed his head respectfully to Ji-Patten. “Servant,” he said\nformally. “May I ask what a representative of the emperor wants with my\nguest?”\nStyke ran his eyes across the audience. It was as varied as any street\ncrowd—old and young, men and women. No children, of course. All of\nthem wore formal, loose-fitting clothing embroidered with Household\ncrests. There were a lot more than five hundred people in this chamber, and\nhe realized that many of them were assistants or those who were second in\ncommand. Everyone had turned out to see this.\nSee what? He realized something else, and that was that no one looked\nlike they were ready to participate. They wore the curious expressions of\npeople who’d turned out for a boxing match. This was a spectator sport, and\nhe was one of the participants.\nBut in what way?\n“You may,” Ji-Patten answered after a moment of theatrical pause.\nAnother such pause followed the statement.\nEtzi coughed into his hand, clearly unimpressed. “Servant, I was told\nthat my guest would not be disturbed by the Quorum. He is the companion\nof Ji-Orz, who is on a task from the Great Ka, and he is beyond reproach.”\n“This matter does not concern your guest.”\n“Then why is he here?”\n“It concerns one of his soldiers.”\nA murmur went through the crowd. It was quickly hushed by the crowd\nitself. People leaned forward in their seats.\nEtzi blinked back at Ji-Patten. Styke took a deep breath, reminding\nhimself that this was important—he needed to remain silent. Let Etzi handle\nthings. Any word he spoke would be used against him in the minds of the\nQuorum. Etzi finally cleared his throat and cast an expansive look across\nthe Quorum. “I’m not sure I understand.”\n“Your guest—Colonel Ben.” He emphasized “Ben” as if he knew it\nwasn’t his full name. “I have not called into question his place alongside Ji-\nOrz. But he is a commanding officer, is he not?”\n“He is.”\n“To these soldiers?” Ji-Patten thrust a finger toward the Lancers sitting\nbehind him.\nStyke noted that several of his soldiers were already looking at one of\ntheir own. They knew as much Dynize as Styke, and even those who\nweren’t quick with languages had already gotten the gist of what was going\non. Zak squirmed in his seat, sweating heavily, while his brother whispered\nurgently in his ear. Styke wanted to walk over to them and demand to know\nwhat was going on.\n“He is their commanding officer, yes,” Etzi said to the last question, the\nwords much slower and more hesitant.

The rest\nof the Lancers surged to their feet, but Dynize soldiers sprang to attention\naround them, forcing them back down at bayonet point.\n“What’s going on?” Styke whispered angrily.\n“Quiet!” Etzi snapped at him. “Ji-Patten, explain yourself!”\nJi-Patten dragged a struggling Zak into the center of the platform until\nthey were mere feet from Styke and Etzi. Zak wiggled and squirmed, but to\nno avail against the iron hold of the dragonman. Ji-Patten locked gazes with\nStyke, ignoring his prisoner as if he were a panicking rabbit. “Yesterday\nmorning, your man murdered another prisoner.”\n“It was self-defense!” Zak shouted.\n“Silence!” Ji-Patten cuffed Zak on the side of the head, hard enough that\nZak’s struggles ceased entirely and his face took on a look of confused\nstupidity. “He murdered another prisoner,” he repeated.\n“Then he should have a trial.” Styke forced the words out, trying not to\nlook at Zak and certainly not to look at the worried faces of his men.\n“Exactly! I am glad you agree, Colonel Ben, because the trial has\nalready been conducted. This soldier has been found guilty of murder. A\ntribunal has sentenced him to death.”\n“What tribunal?” Etzi demanded. “What trial? This is preposterous!”\nIt took every ounce of willpower for Styke to keep himself from falling\nforward, knife drawn. A cold fist seemed to curl around his stomach,\nleaving him ill and weak. This was it, then? This was Sedial’s first real blow\n—a way of getting at Styke without laying a finger on him and, presumably,\nto show Styke that he could do anything he wanted to the soldiers in that\nprison.\nJi-Patten’s glare drove Etzi back to Styke’s side. “Meln-Etzi, remember\nyourself! The trial has occurred and there will be no dispute.”\n“What do you want?” Styke demanded.\n“Ben!” Etzi whispered in warning.\n“Want?” Ji-Patten asked. “I want justice. Nothing more.” A bone knife\nsuddenly appeared in his hand, as if drawn from thin air. The audience\ngasped. Ji-Patten spun it in his fingers, offering it hilt-first to Styke. “As a\nshow of respect, I will allow you, his superior officer, to carry out the\nexecution.”\nStyke stared at the hilt of the knife. His fingers twitched. He felt Etzi\ntouch his arm, and heard his urgent whisper. “He’s trying to provoke you,\ninto either violence or rebuttal. If you claim not to recognize the judgment,\nhe’ll hold you in contempt of our courts and bring you into the suit. If\nyou…” Styke stopped listening. All he could hear was the murmur of the\naudience. All he could feel was fury. All he could see was red.\n“I won’t have his blood on my hands,” he finally answered stiffly.\n“I see.” Ji-Patten took a sudden step back. He jerked on Zak’s collar,"

His knife hand suddenly dipped, almost\ntoo fast to follow. Zak stiffened, letting out a terrible gasp, and then slid\nfrom Ji-Patten’s fingers to splay on the floor. Blood poured from the side of\nhis neck, spreading across the platform. Etzi retreated back almost to the\nentry hall. Styke let the blood pool around his boots, unmoving.\nThe Quorum was silent enough to hear a pin drop. Through it, suddenly,\nburst a sob. Markus tried to crawl over the soldiers holding him back. At a\ngesture from Ji-Patten, he was suddenly allowed to run forward. He slipped\nin his brother’s blood, sliding and stumbling, until he cradled Zak’s head in\nhis lap. The weeping filled the hall.\nJi-Patten returned his knife to his shirt and strode over to Styke. Styke\ntowered a full head above him, but Ji-Patten approached until their chests\nalmost touched. Styke ignored him, looking down at the sight of Markus\nholding his brother.\n“Not strong enough to do the deed yourself, are you?” Ji-Patten\ndemanded.\nA little part of his brain told Styke that he had won. Somehow, in a\ntwisted way, he had bested Ji-Patten. This spectacle had been a battle of\nwills. If he raised a fist now, he would ruin it all. His hands trembled.\n“You should have done it yourself,” Ji-Patten growled. “Are you not\nman enough?” He raised a hand slowly. His palm opened. The gesture was\nso clearly conveyed as to be impossible to miss. Ji-Patten drew back and\nslapped Styke across the face.\nStyke shifted his gaze to look at Ji-Patten.\n“Do I have your attention now, Ben Styke?” Ji-Patten whispered.\n“Servant!” Etzi shouted angrily. “Stop this at once!”\n“Will you not fight back?” Ji-Patten asked. His hand raised again.\nAnother slap, this one significantly harder, like the sharp crack of a belt\nacross Styke’s jaw.\nStyke sniffed. “Is that all you’ve got?” he asked just loudly enough that\nhis voice carried.\nJi-Patten took a step back and raised his arm once more. Closed-fist this\ntime. “If I kill you with this blow, I will barely be punished.” A whisper.\nStyke didn’t respond. He kept his eyes locked with Ji-Patten’s.\nThe fist struck him just below the heart and felt like a kick from a\nwarhorse. Styke leaned into it, letting his weight absorb the impact, refusing\nto be driven back even half a step. It took a few moments to regain his\nbreath, but he let nothing show on his face. Slowly, deliberately, he let the\ncorner of his lip twitch upward in a sneer. He put every bit of his fury into\nit.\nJi-Patten’s cheeks twitched; his eyes widened. His expression very\nclearly said that he’d killed men with such a blow—and Styke did not doubt\nit. That punch would have made Valyaine proud."

That punch would have made Valyaine proud.\n“Your god needs a new servant, Ji-Patten,” Styke said loudly. “Because\nI’ve been struck harder by a child.” His voice echoed throughout the\naudience hall. The Quorum watched, every one of them slack-jawed.\nJi-Patten drew back his fist again.\n“Servant!” Etzi barked. “Enough.”\nThe words finally seemed to get through to the dragonman. He blinked,\nshaking his head slightly, and only now seemed to see that he was standing\nin Zak’s blood. He cast about him in disgust, then turned and strode off the\nplatform and down to the side exit, leaving bloody footprints behind.\n“Return them to their cells, and burn the murderer’s body,” he barked at his\nsoldiers.\nStyke remained where he was while his soldiers were filed out. He\nwatched them drag Markus through his brother’s blood, then take away\nZak’s body. Porters appeared to clean up the blood, while the Quorum\nerupted into a shouting match that drowned out any thoughts that may have\nbeen creeping through Styke’s head. It wasn’t until he felt a gentle hand on\nhis arm that he allowed himself to be led into the same large hallway\nthrough which he’d entered. Once they were out of sight of the Quorum, he\nsagged against the wall, resting a hand on his chest and staring at the blood\nall over his boots.\n“I’m sorry.” Styke looked up at the soft words. Etzi stood across from\nhim, looking ashen and defeated. Etzi continued, “I didn’t know they would\nstoop so low.”\n“Evil men will stoop to anything they see fit,” Styke responded without\nfeeling. “I’ve done so myself.” He wanted to shout and flail, to pick up Etzi\nand throw him against the wall. The vision of Markus cradling his brother’s\nbody was now burned into his memory.\n“Thank you for not responding.” Etzi gazed at Styke’s cheek. It still\nburned, and he imagined that it was very red.\n“Once in a very great while, I do as I’m told,” Styke said. His fury was\nstill there, burning in his belly, but it seemed muted and distant. He pressed\nhis thumb against the lance tip of his big ring until he felt it draw blood.\n“But your arrogant prick of a Great Ka still hasn’t learned his lesson.”\n“What lesson is that?”\n“That I’m Ben Styke.”\nCHAPTER 46\nM\nichel stood on the southern edge of the Landfall Plateau, eyes intent on\nthe park down below where he’d asked Tenik to meet him at four. It was\nonly noon, and he intended on being there early enough that no one would\nget the drop on him. He worked through his nerves, testing contingency\nplans in his head, knowing that he was being a fool.\n“You’re actually flustered,” Ichtracia said. She stood next to him on the\nedge of the plateau, enjoying the sun on her face, looking out across the\nfloodplains toward the distant tower of the godstone.\nThe statement took Michel off guard. “I’m what?”"

She seemed almost pleased, and it was\ngetting on Michel’s nerves. “You were angry and in pain and desperate, but\nyou weren’t flustered. This is…” She rubbed her face, physically wiping the\nsmile away. “I shouldn’t laugh. You’re right, this isn’t funny. But seeing you\nso conflicted is kind of…”\n“Vindicating?” Michel asked. The word came out as an angry snarl.\n“A little,” Ichtracia said as if she didn’t notice his anger. “But I was\nthinking humanizing. Just another piece of the real Michel Bravis.” She\nsuddenly stepped forward and, to Michel’s surprise, took his face in her\nhands. Before he could react, she kissed him gently on the lips. “It’s all\nright. We’re going to warn Yaret, aren’t we?”\nMichel swallowed. He was flustered. Flustered and conflicted. He was\ngoing against all of his instincts and training. He was operating off a half-\ncocked plan that might get him killed—or worse, dragged through the\nstreets and delivered straight to Ka-Sedial. “Yes. I can’t just drop these off.”\nHe patted his bag, where he was carrying the purge orders. “I need them to\nknow they come from me, I need them to—”\n“You need them to know that you wouldn’t abandon them,” Ichtracia\nsaid.\nMichel swallowed a lump in his throat and nodded. He should have felt\nbetter from Ichtracia’s show of understanding. But for some reason he just\nfelt defeated. “I told Tenik to meet me at the garden where we spotted\nForgula. I’m hoping it’s specific enough that he gets the message but vague\nenough that if it’s intercepted by Sedial, I can’t be traced.”\n“And where’s that?”\nMichel pointed off the plateau to a spot down in Lower Landfall. They\ncould see the park from here.\n“You know this is risky?” Ichtracia asked. He could hear the concern in\nher voice.\n“I’m aware. This is why I don’t think you should—”\nIchtracia cut him off. “I came with you to Landfall to watch your back.\nI’m not going to stop because you’re doing the right thing.”\nThat did make him feel better, but not in the way that he expected. The\nwords were even more intimate than the kiss she’d just given him. “Is it the\nright thing?” he asked. “The Palo…”\n“You’ve given them everything. You don’t have to give them your\nfriends, too.” Michel noticed that the corners of Ichtracia’s eyes were red.\nShe continued, “I’ve never been allowed to have friends. Allies and\nenemies. I… envy you the opportunity to save someone you care about.”\nMichel took a shaky breath. “Thank you.”\nThey headed down the side of the plateau and toward Claden Park."

        "text": "enemies. I… envy you the opportunity to save someone you care about.”\nMichel took a shaky breath. “Thank you.”\nThey headed down the side of the plateau and toward Claden Park.\nMichel gave the park a wide berth and found an old factory overlooking a\nrow of townhouses with a clear view of the area. They did a circuit of the\nfactory before finding a rusted iron ladder that led to the roof. He slapped\nthe side of the building. “All right. Up you go.”\n“You’re not coming?”\n“No. You’re taking this spot. Like you said—watch my back. I told him\nto meet me here in four hours, so we might have to wait a while. If I wave\ntwice, I want you to join me. If I wave three times, stay put. If I wave\nonce… well, get the pit out of here.”\nIchtracia hesitated for a moment before giving him a nod. The intimacy\nand concern she’d shown on the plateau were gone, replaced by a cold,\nbusinesslike demeanor. She began to climb.\nMichel didn’t wait for her to get into position before heading to the row\nof houses just in front of the factory. He could make his way up to one of\nthose roofs. He’d be in sight of Ichtracia, and he in turn could watch for\nTenik—and find out whether Tenik, as requested, had come alone. If\neverything went smoothly, he and Ichtracia would be heading back to\nGreenfire Depths by nightfall.\nHe found the roof access near the end of the row of townhouses—a\nnarrow iron staircase for chimney sweeps. It was about ten feet off the\nground, so he began looking for something to use as a ladder, when he\nheard footsteps coming up behind him. He pulled his gaze off the staircase\nand adopted a purposeful limp, so that anyone coming across him might\nthink he was just a cripple looking for a shortcut through the alley.\n“That’s not going to work, Michel.”\nThe words felt like a cold knife through the gut. Michel stiffened and\nbroke into a run, only to make it a half-dozen steps before several figures\ncut off the end of the alley. They wore morion helmets and carried muskets,\nwith the Household symbol of Yaret draped over their cuirasses. Michel\nskidded to a stop and spun to look back the way he’d come.\nTenik stood about fifty paces back, leaning heavily on a cane. The\ncupbearer looked unimpressed and tired. He was flanked by four more\nsoldiers. Michel searched desperately for an escape. This wasn’t how this\nwas supposed to go. Not at all. Ichtracia couldn’t see him from here, and\neven if she could, he didn’t want her to attack Tenik. He bit his lip, looking\nfor a way out and finding nothing.\nTenik limped across the space separating them. His face was red, his\nbrow covered in sweat.\n“I thought I said to meet me in the park,” Michel said, unable to think of\nanything else.\n“Which is exactly why we’re waiting for you here,” Tenik replied,\ngiving Michel a shallow smile. “You did train me in some of this stuff,\nremember? I figured all I needed to do was beat you here and figure out\nwhere you’d be watching from.”"

I figured all I needed to do was beat you here and figure out\nwhere you’d be watching from.”\n“Well.” Michel swallowed hard. “I’m impressed.”\nTenik snorted. “Why are you still here, Michel? I warned you, didn’t I?”\n“You did.”\n“I keep my promises.”\n“Yeah.” Michel eyeballed the soldiers again, then glanced over his\nshoulder at those behind him. Definitely no way out. It wouldn’t be long\nbefore Ichtracia began to wonder what was taking him so long, but it might\nstill be ten or twenty minutes before she came down to check. He\nconsidered running, but even if he could get past the soldiers, the look in\nTenik’s eye told him that he would definitely get shot in the back.\n“I’m either killing you or taking you in,” Tenik said regretfully. “Pick\none.”\n“You’re not going to ask why I wanted to meet?”\n“If you come in, you’ll be telling us a lot of things.”\n“It doesn’t look like I have much of a choice.”\n“There’s always a choice,” Tenik replied. “You have two right now.” He\nlifted his hand, and Michel turned to see a carriage pull up to the end of the\nalleyway behind him. The windows were shaded with drapes matching the\ndecoration on the soldiers’ cuirasses. Michel even recognized the driver as\none of the Yaret Household, though he couldn’t remember the woman’s\nname.\nHe realized that Tenik was giving him a choice—an out. Michel could\nrun. He could be gunned down in the street. It wasn’t a pleasant choice, but\nit was still a way to save himself and all the information stored in his head.\nIt was a way to avoid the endless tortures that Sedial had no doubt planned\nfor him.\n“Does Sedial know that you’ve found me?” Michel asked.\nTenik gestured once more to the carriage.\nIf Michel got into that carriage, he was a dead man, and everyone he\nknew would die along with him—Jiniel, Emerald, Mama Palo’s entire\norganization. He would spill it all to the bone-eyes. He tensed, spreading his\nfeet to prepare to run.\n“Tenik,” a voice suddenly called. “Please stop the theatrics. Bring him\nover here.”\nMichel turned in surprise to find the carriage door open and Yaret\nhimself peering out from within. The Household head motioned\nimpatiently. “If you want to talk to me, Michel, you’ll have to do it quickly\nbefore Sedial’s spies know that I’ve left the house. Now, come!”\nMichel considered one more dash to freedom—or death—before turning\ntoward the carriage. He joined Yaret within. The carriage was rolling before\nhe’d even sat down, and he could hear Tenik giving instructions to the\nbodyguard from the running board. He laid his bag across his lap and met\nYaret’s eye.\nYaret looked much the same as he had when they’d last met, if a little\nworn around the edges. He gave Michel a fatherly smile and shook his\nhead. “Tenik told me that you’d changed your appearance drastically, but I\ndidn’t believe that it was this much. No wonder you’re still avoiding"

No wonder you’re still avoiding\ndetection.” He glanced down at Michel’s two missing fingers and clicked\nhis tongue, but did not comment on them. “I like you, Michel, but your\nimmediate fate depends very much on whatever it is you wanted to tell us.”\nMichel let himself relax into the carriage bench, taking on an air of\nconfidence that he did not feel. The winds had just shifted, and he could\nsense that this was now a negotiation rather than an execution. “Tenik told\nyou who I really am?”\n“He told me that you’re claiming to be a Palo freedom fighter. Though\nwhether that’s your real identity or not, then”—Yaret gave a small shrug\n—“I find it strange that you’re now fighting the Dynize, when it seems\nfrom my perspective that we have given you Palo a hundred times more\nfreedom than you ever had beneath the Kressians.”\n“That’s… a discussion we can have later,” Michel said.\n“If there is a later.”\n“I think there will be.” Michel reached into his bag and fetched the\npurge order that he’d set aside from the main bundle. He handed it to Yaret.\n“I stole this from Ji-Noren’s apartment yesterday morning.”\n“You robbed Ka-Sedial’s best dragonman?” Yaret said in disbelief. He\nreached into his breast pocket for a pair of reading glasses, clicking his\ntongue again. “You’re one bold…” He trailed off as he got the glasses onto\nthe bridge of his nose and opened the envelope. Michel watched his eyes\nflick across the page and the blood drain from his face. Yaret rapped on the\nceiling. “Tenik!”\n“Master?” the response came.\n“Stop the carriage and join us.”\nThe instructions were followed, and Yaret’s cupbearer was soon sitting\nnext to Michel. Yaret gave him the letter.\n“Where did you get this?” Tenik demanded breathlessly as soon as he’d\nfinished reading.\n“Ji-Noren’s apartment,” Michel answered.\n“Could it be a forgery?” Yaret asked.\nTenik glanced sharply at Michel, studying him for a moment, before\ncautiously shaking his head. “This is the imperial seal. This is Sedial’s\nscrawl. This is his signature. This is the emperor’s signature.” Tenik sniffed\nthe paper. “It’s even the powder Sedial uses to dry the ink. If it’s a forgery,\nI’ve never seen the like.”\nMichel reached back into his bag and produced the bundle of purge\norders. He gave them to Tenik, who immediately began to open each, listing\noff the Household names aloud and setting them aside. “Master,” he said to\nYaret, “these are all our allies. Our relatives. Everyone we—”\nYaret cut him off with a raised hand and turned back to Michel. “You\nknow what this means, don’t you?”\n“Sedial is about to consolidate his power,” Michel replied. “And he has\nthe emperor’s backing to do it. He’ll wipe out anyone who might oppose\nhim in the future.”\n“Not just here. He’ll have sent five times this many orders back to\nDynize.

The rest of my Household will be in danger.” Yaret inhaled sharply\nand seemed to struggle to gain control over his emotions. He narrowed his\neyes at Michel. “You risked everything to bring this to us?”\nMichel didn’t answer.\n“You knew that Tenik would follow through on his promise to kill you.\nEven now, we could take you directly to Sedial and hand you over in an\nattempt to get this sentence commuted.” Yaret shook the envelope under\nMichel’s nose.\n“I figured that was a possibility,” Michel admitted.\n“But you did it anyway.”\nMichel glanced sidelong at Tenik. “I’m pretty good at reading people,\nand neither you nor Tenik struck me as the type to betray someone trying to\nhelp you. And as Tenik said to me—for the space of a summer, you were\nmy friends. My family. I may be a spy, but I’m not a monster. I’m not going\nto stand aside and allow your Household to be slaughtered simply to save\nmy own skin.”\nYaret tapped the envelope against his chin, looking down at the pile of\npurge orders in Tenik’s lap. There was a sudden knock on the door. It\nopened a crack, and one of the soldiers stuck his nose in. His eyes were\nwide, his tone frightened. “Master.”\n“What is it?” Tenik asked sharply. “Speak up, man. Is it the Great Ka?”\n“No, it’s… I can’t entirely be certain, but I think that there’s a Privileged\nwatching us from the rooftop.”\n“A Privileged?” Tenik asked. “Who could possibly…?”\n“She looks different, but I think it’s Ichtracia.”\nBoth Yaret and Tenik looked at Michel. He swallowed his unhappiness\nat the discovery and shrugged. “She’s with me. You probably shouldn’t\nmake any sudden moves until I leave the carriage.”\nTo his surprise, Yaret began to chuckle, waving his hand to dismiss the\nguard. “Remain where we are,” he ordered. “Let me know if she approaches\nor puts on gloves.” As soon as the door had closed again, he glanced at\nMichel. “You turned Sedial’s granddaughter.”\n“I’m not sure if I turned her,” Michel replied, “or just gave her more\nchoices.”\nYaret sighed, staring at the purge order in his hand. “This,” he said,\ntapping the order, “is not unexpected.”\n“Master?” Tenik asked, a note of warning in his voice.\n“It’s all right. Michel may not be on our side, but he’s not our enemy,\neither. At least, not to the Yaret Household.” He studied his fingertips for a\nmoment, clearly coming to some decision, before continuing. “Michel, for\nalmost two years we have been planning on removing Sedial from power.”\nMichel scoffed. “You what?”\n“It’s been a long time in the planning, with the utmost secrecy, known\nonly to the Household heads involved in the plot and their closest\ncupbearers. Most of the names on this purge are in on it.” He gave Michel a\nsad smile. “Together with our allies back in Dynize, we’ve been planning a\nbloodless coup that would force Sedial into retirement, destroy his hold"

Before he uses the godstone, that’s for sure.”\n“You’d better be ready to act quickly then, because it’s active.”\n“It can’t be,” Tenik protested. “He’s supposed to tell us.”\nMichel shook his head. “I’m almost certain he’s managed to activate it\nand is only waiting until he has the third stone in his possession. Ichtracia\nagrees with me.”\nYaret waved the purge order at Tenik. “I think we should set aside any\ntrust that we have left for the Great Ka. We shouldn’t be surprised that he’s\nmoved forward in secret. And this… this changes everything.” He pressed\nhis fingers against his chin, staring at the paper, deep in thought.\n“Will you act?” Michel asked.\n“I’m not sure if we can. Our conspiracy to remove the Great Ka from\npower has been so carefully planned. We seek to avoid another civil war at\nall costs. We planned to weaken his public support, distance him from his\nallies, and then force him to resign.” Yaret flipped the envelope back open\nand read through the purge order once more. “Eight days. I don’t know\nwhat we can do.” He gestured. “Michel, you should return to Ichtracia\nbefore she gets nervous. I don’t want an incident.”\nMichel looked at Tenik, half expecting the cupbearer to object to his\nbeing released. But Tenik seemed to have already forgotten he was there.\n“I’m sorry,” Michel said.\nYaret looked up. “Don’t be,” he said with a smile. “I’m not sure if I or\nany of my Household will be alive by the end of next week. But at the very\nleast, you’ve given us a chance to fight for our lives. Thank you. Now, go,\nbefore the People-Eater gets twitchy.”\nMichel stepped out of the carriage and glanced up to see Ichtracia’s\nrelieved face looking down at him from above. Not only had she spotted the\ncarriage and followed it, but she’d managed to flank their position from\nhigh ground. He felt a stab of pride, and headed down a nearby alley away\nfrom the carriage. None of the soldiers stopped him as he left.\nHe was able to fetch Ichtracia, and the two of them were halfway across\nthe city before they spoke again. “I almost had a heart attack when you\ndidn’t show up on that rooftop,” Ichtracia finally said.\n“But you found me. Thanks for that.”\n“I take it that Tenik was grateful for the news?”\nMichel walked to a café and sat down, ordering two iced coffees. He\ndidn’t want to stay out in public for too long, but he also needed a shot of\nenergy. The encounter with Yaret had left him feeling emotionally\nexhausted. “It was Yaret.

I\nnever thought the Households would have the guts to oppose him.”\nMichel took his coffee when it arrived and drained it, then stared into the\ncup. He felt troubled, cursed by the feeling that he would never see Tenik or\nYaret again. “I got the impression that they’re not going to get the chance.\nThey’ve been planning for years, yet Sedial is going to strike too quickly.”\nHe waited until Ichtracia finished her coffee, then stood up, trying to cast\nthe Yaret Household from his mind.

She recognized this territory\nnow, the flat plains replaced by gentle, rolling hills, with the shadowy\nspecter of the Ironhook Mountains to their west and the true foothills to\ntheir north. She and Taniel had swept through here a few months ago on\ntheir mad dash to Yellow Creek. All of that felt like a dream now, and it\nsaddened her to remember the sorcery in her veins like lightning, pushing\nboth of them on long after their horses dropped from exhaustion and they\nwere forced to trade with the locals for new ones.\nBurt’s arrival at her side in the middle of the afternoon was sudden, if\nnot unexpected. He rode up to her as she examined the horizon, a cigar\nclamped between his teeth, and studiously examined the same horizon until\nshe lowered her looking glass.\n“You know,” he said in greeting, “I recognized you pretty early back at\nYellow Creek. I’ve been to Adro and I’ve heard the stories and read the\nnewspapers. But damn me if I’m not a little impressed.”\nVlora turned to him in confusion. “Oh?”\nHe gestured to the column marching past them. “A real-life Adran field\narmy. As a kid who grew up reading everything he could about Field\nMarshal Tamas, this tickles the pit out of me.”\n“I’ve always thought it much like any other field army,” Vlora said\noffhandedly, though even as she spoke, she knew she was lying.\n“Nah.” Burt waved her off. “I’ve seen field armies. Fatrastans, Kez,\nDeliv. I’ve even seen the Dynize now. But there’s something different about"

A higher step, a more efficient march and camp. Did you\nknow that on average an Adran army marches roughly three miles farther in\na day than the next fastest army in the world?”\nVlora pursed her lips. She was sure she’d heard that somewhere.\n“Tamas’s reforms during the Gurlish Wars,” she told him. “We were already\nvery good before he came along—we had to be, being the smallest nation in\nthe Nine. But once he was field marshal, everything changed. He gutted the\nofficer corps and began promoting by merit. He started using the Privileged\ncabal less in his campaigns. Speed and organization replaced the old system\nbent on gaining glory for noble officers.”\n“It shows.” Burt nodded, ashing his cigar. “Anyway, I wanted to let you\nknow that we’ve made contact with my irregulars.”\nVlora’s head came up. “We’re that close?”\n“Just a few miles from the river,” he confirmed. “My boys are hurting,\nI’ve got to admit. They’ve kept the Dynize pinned down at the river, but the\nDynize outnumber them significantly, and it’s beginning to show. I’m\nheaded to their camp now to get the lay of the land.”\n“I’m going with you,” Vlora said, the words leaving her mouth before\nshe’d even considered them. She swore inwardly. She couldn’t make such\nrash decisions anymore. She needed to be thoughtful, cautious. What if this\nwas a trap? What if the Dynize counterattacked while she was with Burt?\n“If that’s all right,” she added. “I’ll need to give a few orders and gather a\nbodyguard.”\n“Of course,” Burt said, raising both eyebrows. “We’d be honored to\nhave you.”\n“Give me thirty minutes,” she said, turning and riding down the column.\nShe found General Sabastenien and Bo together on the side of the road,\nsmoking their pipes while they stared off to the south. “Does every damn\nperson in this army smoke something?” she asked as she approached.\n“Ma’am.” Sabastenien greeted her with a nod. Bo raised one hand and\nfuriously puffed up a cloud.\n“You’re just the two I’m looking for. Anything to report on this business\nwith the Dynize and Palo?”\n“Nothing much new,” Sabastenien said unhappily. “There doesn’t seem\nto be a sorcerous aspect to the kidnapping—simply racial. The Dynize are\ngrabbing all the Palo and sending them to the river. From there we can only\nassume they’re sending them downriver on keelboats.”\n“They’d have to be going by the hundreds.”\n“Thousands, more like,” Bo interjected.\n“Forced labor?”\n“I’m not so sure anymore,” Bo said, holding something out to Vlora. It\nwas a yellowed handbill, decorated with a pair of freckled hands and the\nwords DYNIZE AND PALO: COUSINS UNITED.\nVlora snorted in disbelief. “They’re kidnapping them to turn them into\nallies?”"

But if they\ndo, the Dynize are clearly consolidating what they think of as their people.\nIt could be for labor, for conscription, for census taking… pretty much\nanything.”\n“But why kill the Kressians?”\n“Purifying?” Bo suggested. “There was more than one shah during the\nGurlish Wars who killed every Kressian that crossed her path. She believed\nthat she had to cleanse the continent before her chosen gods could return\nagain.”\nVlora shivered. “That is terrifying.”\n“And it could have far-reaching implications. We haven’t heard of\nanything similar in the big cities yet, but if the Dynize decide to wipe out\nevery Kressian on the continent, they have enough soldiers to begin at any\ntime.”\n“Shit,” Vlora swore. “All right, Sabastenien, I want you to take this\ntheory to Delia. Use it as leverage. Not even she’s bitter enough to let Adran\nexpatriates die by the tens of thousands to spite me.”\n“Yes, ma’am.”\n“And while you’re there, I want you to sit in on her little summits. She\nhas more representatives coming in today to talk, right?”\n“She does,” Bo confirmed. “From the other two armies on our tail.”\n“Sit in on those,” she repeated to Sabastenien. “Keep notes. Don’t say\nanything unless Delia seems like she’s about to promise the world.”\nSabastenien nodded sharply.\n“Bo, come with me.”\n“Where are we going?”\n“To meet with Burt’s irregulars.”\nSometime in the last week, Burt and Bo had become the closest of friends.\nIt shouldn’t have surprised Vlora at all, but this was the first time she’d seen\nthem together, and she was pleased that the two of them were laughing,\njoking, and going on at length as they left the main army and headed toward\nBurt’s irregulars camp. They were even sharing Burt’s cigars.\nVlora was playing this little visit safe. She’d brought Norrine, Davd, Bo,\nand three hundred of her cavalry with her. If the Dynize managed to get the\ndrop on them, the tin-heads would be in for a pit of a fight.\nThe trip was not as long as she’d expected, and they were only about\nthree-quarters of a mile off the main highway when Burt’s messenger led\nthem behind an abandoned plantation building and down into a steep,\nwooded ravine that separated the property between two of the plantations.\nThe ravine looked innocuous from afar, but once they’d descended a narrow\nmule track, it seemed to open up and revealed a well-worn camp.\nThey were challenged by a sentry who, once Burt and his guide had\nbeen identified, emerged to join them on the mule track. The young woman\nsaluted Burt and regarded Vlora, Bo, and their escort with wide eyes. “You\nweren’t kidding when you said you were going for help, boss,” she said."

Last I heard, they’ve got it into a keelboat and are preparing\na flotilla to get them going again. Tomm and the lads are trying to sink it.”\nAs if to emphasize the point, a distant boom reverberated through the\nravine. “That would be them,” the sentry said.\n“Grenades,” Burt explained. “Some of my irregulars apprenticed with\nLittle Flerring when we were in Yellow Creek. Made some improvements\non the standard Adran army explosives. But they still have to get real damn\nclose to use them.” He swore several more times. “There’s only so much we\ncan do as skirmishers. If we’re close enough to use grenades, the Dynize\nmight be able to wipe us out.” He turned his gaze on Vlora, asking an\nunspoken question.\nVlora froze. She’d sworn to herself not to make any stupid decisions that\nput her and her men at unnecessary risk. With a whole field army less than a\nmile or two behind her, she was about to bring overwhelming force down\non the Dynize. No need to endanger anyone. But the Palo Nation irregulars\nwere putting their lives on the line to stop the Dynize. She couldn’t just let\nthem all die.\nShe nodded at Burt, then the sentry. “Lead on. Let’s go give them a bit\nof relief.”\nThe sentry led their group down the ravine for several hundred yards\nbefore bringing them up the other side and out into the open again. They\ncrossed yet another plantation, rounded a hill, and were suddenly in clear\nview of the Hadshaw River Valley.\nThe river was perhaps three hundred yards down the hillside from them,\nflowing gently through the plantation fields that ran all the way down to its\nbanks. The banks themselves were held by a Dynize brigade, which was\ncamped on either side of the river and held a wide stone bridge that, unless\nshe was mistaken, marked the crossing of the very highway Vlora’s soldiers\nwere marching down at this moment. The river was packed with keelboats,\nlashed to the bank and to the bridge.\nIt took her only a moment to spot their target—the largest of the\nkeelboats, loaded with a rectangular stone roughly the size of one of the\ncovered wagons frontiersmen favored for transportation. There was, at this\ndistance, nothing special about the stone. It lacked ornamentation, and\nthough it was the same color as the godstone they’d cracked back up in\nYellow Creek, it didn’t give her the same sense of dread.

Perhaps, though,\nthat was simply because she had no sorcery.\nThe keelboat was directly under the stone bridge, which was the\nepicenter of a sizable engineering project—cranes, counterweights,\nstabilizing equipment—that had clearly been used to bring the stone out of\nthe water and plop it onto the keelboat.\nEven as Vlora took all of this in, she saw Burt’s irregulars engaged in a\nfierce firefight on the edge of the river. There were only a few hundred of\nthem compared to the thousands of Dynize, but they had managed to push\nhard and bottle up a decent number of the enemy on the bridge itself. The\nirregulars fired and reloaded at an astonishing speed, powder smoke rising\nfrom their little group as they locked down the reeling Dynize. Occasionally\na grenade would burst among the Dynize line, adding to the confusion.\nEven with their momentum, the irregulars couldn’t hope to reach the\nbridge. The Dynize were on the back foot, but they had the strength in\nnumbers. Vlora reined in, took a deep breath of the powder smoke on the\nwind, and snapped off orders.\n“Captain,” she barked to the commander of her bodyguard, “take your\ndragoons and relieve the irregulars. Burt, pull your men out of there. My\nsoldiers will provide covering fire.”\n“That keelboat is starting to move under the bridge,” Burt warned. “If it\ngets moving, there’s no stopping it.”\n“It’s not going anywhere. Go!” Vlora’s dragoons responded\nimmediately, galloping down the hill at full speed while drawing their\ncarbines. Burt urged his own horse after them. “Do we need to get you\ncloser to sink that keelboat?” Vlora asked Bo.\nBo wiggled his fingers like a father about to show his child a trick, then\nslipped on both of his gloves, tugging at the hems theatrically. “Not even a\nlittle. And I’ll do better than sink it.”\nFor the faintest breath of a moment, Vlora thought that she felt\nsomething. It might have been a cold breeze, or it might have been muscle\nmemory from watching so much sorcery, but when Bo’s fingers began to\ntwitch, she could have sworn that a tickle went up between her shoulder\nblades. She drew out her looking glass and turned it on the keelboat.\n“Do you have orders for us?” Norrine asked. Both she and Davd had\ndismounted and prepared their rifles.\n“Wait,” Vlora said, watching carefully. Almost a minute passed, and she\nignored the shouting of her dragoons and the sudden pop of carbine fire as\nthey reached the irregulars. The keelboat emerged from beneath the bridge,\nbut instead of gaining momentum, it began to slow again. Within seconds it\nhad stopped entirely, and the Dynize soldiers on board frantically pushed\nand shoved with their poles to try to get it moving again. It took her another\nmoment to see the band of ice forming around the base of the keelboat. The\nice began to spread, locking the keelboat in place. “All right,” she told"

The\nice began to spread, locking the keelboat in place. “All right,” she told\nNorrine, “ignore their officers. Clear that keelboat of life. I want the three of\nyou to keep it locked up.”\nIt was almost fifteen minutes before Burt returned with his irregulars\nand Vlora’s dragoons. The former were badly mauled, hauling as many\nwounded and dead along with them as they had still walking. The latter had\nsuffered light casualties, but their blood was obviously up as their captain\nrequested permission to continue his skirmish with the Dynize.\n“Denied,” Vlora replied, listening to Davd’s rifle bark. A Dynize soldier\nattempting to board the big keelboat tumbled into the water. The Dynize\nbrigade had crossed over to this side of the river and finally drawn up into\nlines. They waffled on the bank, as if undecided on whether they should\ncharge Vlora’s small group or remain to defend their ward. Vlora\nrummaged in her saddlebags until she found a white handkerchief, and\nhanded it over to the captain. “Put this on the end of your sword. I want you\nto let the enemy general know that I will give him generous terms to\nsurrender if he orders his men to throw down their muskets immediately.”\nVlora sat back and waited while the captain headed back down the hill\nwith a few companions. A group emerged from the Dynize lines, and the\ntwo envoys began their meeting.\nWhile she waited, the head of Vlora’s army crested the road directly\nbehind her. She was soon joined by General Sabastenien and Nila.\nSabastenien snapped a sharp salute. “We heard fighting and brought the\ncavalry, ma’am.”\n“Well done.” She gestured to the meeting below them. “Hopefully they\nwon’t be necessary, but…”\nShe trailed off as the meeting adjourned, far quicker than she would\nhave expected. The captain returned with his report.\n“They won’t surrender.”\n“They saw that we have more cavalry alone than they have soldiers?”\n“They did. The general…”\n“Doesn’t trust me?” Vlora guessed.\n“Not exactly,” the captain replied. “I got the impression that he’s more\nscared of whoever is giving him orders back in Landfall than he is of you.”\n“Damned fools,” Vlora muttered. “All right. We do this the hard way.\nNila, burn out the front lines. Don’t let your fire hit the keelboats, I want\nthose intact. Sabastenien, I want you to ride down whatever hasn’t burned.\nSend a thousand dragoons downriver to find a ford. I want them to flank the\nDynize and kill or capture everyone who tries to run.”\n“Yes, ma’am.”\nNila tugged at the cuff of her sleeves, frowning down toward the enemy.\n“You don’t want me to give them a warning shot?”\n“They’ve had their warning.

Oh, and Sabastenien?”\n“Yes?”\n“If they throw down their weapons, I want them spared.”\n“Better for our own morale,” he agreed, switching the reins from one\nhand to the other and drawing his sword and calling out to his officers. The\ncolumn of cavalry began to split up, forming into groups and spreading out\nacross the valley. Vlora forced herself to turn and watch the coming battle.\nCHAPTER 48\nI\nt took the Adran Army longer than Vlora expected to crush the Dynize.\nDespite Nila’s flames raining down on them from above, they held their line\nagainst Vlora’s cuirassiers for the better part of the afternoon and well into\nthe evening. It was dark by the time her dragoons managed to flank them\nand the Dynize finally fell apart beneath the two-sided onslaught. Weapons\nwere thrown down, and Vlora’s infantry finally came over the hill to make\ncamp, organize the prisoners, dispose of the dead, and secure the keelboats\nand the stone pedestal that had been the focus of all this effort.\nVlora slept fitfully that night and was up early, heading down to the\nriver’s edge with Davd in tow. The ground still smoldered from Nila’s\nsorcery, but at least the corpses were cleaned up—one of her brigades had\nspent most of the night transporting the bodies downriver a mile and\nburning them all so that they wouldn’t spread disease as her own soldiers\ndug into the position.\n“What’s this bridge called?” she asked Davd, leaving the riverbank and\ngaining the stone bridge, where early-rising infantry were in the midst of\nmoving aside all of the engineering equipment so that they could use the\nwhole span.\n“Ferrymore, I believe,” Davd told her. “Sight of an old ferry. The bridge\nis relatively new.”\n“And well made.” Vlora kicked a stone. No wonder Burt’s irregulars\nhadn’t destroyed it. They probably had no way of doing so. She walked\nacross the bridge, returning salutes from her soldiers, and descended to the\nopposite bank, where she found that the keelboat containing their prize had\nbeen lashed to the opposite bank. She spotted Nila’s colorful dress moving\naround the side of the pedestal and Bo standing on the bank with a number\nof Dynize prisoners. Vlora joined him.\n“Who are these?” she asked.\nBo took a step away from the prisoners. “Officers,” he reported. “Their\ngeneral died in the melee, but we have a colonel and three majors. I’m\ntrying to find out what the bloody pit this stone is for.”\n“Burt thought it was a pedestal.”\n“Yes, and he might be right. But… might also be wrong.”\n“What else could it be used for?”\nHe shrugged. “Not a goddamned clue. Nila was up all night trying to get\nsomething out of it by lamplight.”\n“Are these any help?” Vlora jerked her chin at the prisoners. Three men"

        "text": "something out of it by lamplight.”\n“Are these any help?” Vlora jerked her chin at the prisoners. Three men\nand a woman, all of them staring at their feet in dejection. They’d been\ndisarmed but were not bound, though a rifleman with fixed bayonet had\nbeen assigned to watch each of them.\n“Remember how Etepali told you that every army has their own\norders?”\n“Yes?”\n“Seems that Sedial takes the old ‘Don’t let one hand know what the\nother is doing’ approach very seriously. Not only are the officers in the dark,\nbut it turns out they didn’t even know where they were going until they got\nto Yellow Creek. Once there, they dug this thing out of the mountainside\nand were told to get it back to Landfall. No other information.”\n“Who was giving the orders?”\n“The Privileged that Burt’s irregulars killed in their ambush.”\n“Ah.” Vlora made a sour face.\n“Turns out that they did have a bone-eye with them, too, yesterday.”\nVlora stiffened. “Neither you nor the powder mages noticed?”\n“Nope. He wasn’t very powerful, and apparently he killed himself rather\nthan be taken prisoner.”\nVlora threw her arms up. “Have we just stumbled across Sedial’s most\ndevoted blind followers?”\n“We might have at that,” Bo said seriously.\n“Pit on a stick. Where is Burt?”\n“Probably still sleeping.”\n“Have you been up all night, too?”\nBo nodded. “Baggage train is just arriving. We don’t even have our tent\nyet.”\n“Well, see if you can get anything else out of them. Oh, and do me a\nfavor.”\n“Yes?”\n“Make sure no one tells Delia a damned thing about this stone.”\n“Done.”\n“Thanks.” Vlora turned and, with a deep breath, boarded the keelboat\nwith the pedestal. As she’d expected, she felt nothing from the stone. No\ndread, no sorcerous aura, not even a sense of preternatural foreboding. It\nwas just a cut rock. She had been wrong about one thing—up this close, she\ncould clearly see that the stone was covered in script and symbols that,\nunless her memory was playing tricks on her, matched quite well with those\non the godstone.\nShe rounded the end of the stone and crossed to the other side, where\nshe found Nila squatting beside some writing, her lips pressed into a firm\nline, eyes narrowed. “Shouldn’t Prime Lektor be here?” Vlora asked.\n“He was with the baggage train last night,” Nila answered without\nlooking up. “I’ve sent someone to fetch him, and if he’s not here in an hour,\nI’ll go myself.”\nVlora snorted. Nila was wildly powerful, but the fact that she was so\ndismissive of one of the ancient Predeii pushed past amusing and bordered\non madness. Was Nila stronger than even she let on? Or did Prime’s\ninactivity just bother her that much? “Anything yet?” Vlora asked.\n“Not a bit.” Nila pressed her palm against the stone and shook her head.\n“I haven’t actually seen a complete godstone yet, but this piece here is"

Not even an inkling of sorcery coming off\nit.”\n“Burt claimed it was writhing with dark sorcery.”\n“Perhaps. It might have gone dormant somehow. Or whoever had given\nhim that report was overreacting. I won’t know for sure until I’ve had more\ntime to study it.”\nVlora frowned, wondering if she’d made an enormous mistake. This\nquick march from the coast had cost them lives, time, positioning, and easy\ncontact with her fleet. She had three field armies bearing down on her. Had\nshe done all of this for a piece of rock that held, at the end of the day, no\nimportance? She couldn’t believe it. No, Sedial had sent his soldiers to\nretrieve it for a reason. Now it was her task to find out why.\nShe watched Nila’s examination and was just about to head back across\nthe river to check in with her general staff when she caught sight of Prime\nLektor walking slowly over the bridge toward her. “Speak of him and he\nshall appear,” she muttered.\nNila snorted and still didn’t look up.\nPrime paused on the bank just off the bridge, examining the pedestal\nwith a sour look. He avoided Vlora’s gaze and seemed to be avoiding even\nlooking at Nila. He was rooted in place, and even when Vlora gestured for\nhim to join them, he didn’t respond. Irritated, Vlora left the keelboat and\nwent to him.\n“What is your problem?” she demanded.\nThe Predeii started. “What do you mean?”\n“Why are you standing here with a constipated look on your face? Nila\nand Bo have been at this thing all night.”\n“I’m sure they’re doing a fine job,” he said.\n“And I’m sure the only reason we brought you with us is to figure out\nwhat the pit this is and why the Dynize want it.”\nPrime turned his face toward Vlora, but his gaze remained locked on the\nstone slab. He didn’t answer.\n“Why are you avoiding it?” she demanded.\nHis attention finally shifted to her, and his tone took on an imperious\nnote that she associated more with that of an ancient sorcerer. “I would like\nto remind you who I am and that your friend Taniel is no longer here. I will\nnot be bullied and disrespected.”\nVlora resisted the urge to back down. Prime was immensely powerful, it\nwas true, but she just couldn’t bring herself to care. She couldn’t afford to.\nEither he was a threat that could destroy them all, or he wasn’t. And she\nsuspected that despite his willingness to kill her back at Yellow Creek, he\ndidn’t have the nerve to make a move against four powder mages, two\nPrivileged, and a whole field army. “Why are you afraid of Nila?” she\nasked.\nPrime’s expression visibly tightened.\n“Is she stronger than you?” Vlora pushed.\n“No,” Prime said confidently. “She is not.”"

That is unheard of outside of the gods\nthemselves. Combine that with her considerable strength, and yes, she is\nterrifying. But not personally. Not for the reasons you think.”\n“Then for what reasons?”\nPrime fixed her with a serious consideration. “Because it means that\nsorcery is continuing to evolve. It means that things are changing again. She\nmight be an aberration, or she might be the beginning of a new pattern.”\n“You mean that Privileged won’t need gloves in the future?” That was,\nVlora admitted silently, a little terrifying. Their need for gloves was one of\ntheir biggest weaknesses.\n“It won’t be immediate. I suspect that if this is an evolution, it will take\nhundreds of years.” Prime fell into a contemplative silence, then drew his\nown gloves out of his pockets and tugged them on. “Yes, I’ve been avoiding\nthis. I don’t know what it is, and that also scares me. I sense nothing from it,\nbut it very clearly matches the godstone. My lack of knowledge—as in the\ncase of your friend Nila—terrifies me.

His feet and back hurt\nfrom standing for hours, and his head ached from trying to listen to the\nproceedings as voices echoed out of the hall and arguments often stumbled\nover one another, becoming difficult to keep up with for a nonnative\nspeaker.\nEtzi had assured him that his presence wasn’t necessary, but Styke had\nfelt it his duty to attend these last three days since Zak’s execution. He had\nmany reasons: the hope that he could keep any more of his men from being\ndragged in to be used as pawns; to get out of the compound; even as a sort\nof penance for being unable to prevent Zak’s death.\nFor these three days, Styke had barely slept. His mind raced. His knife\nhand twitched. The world felt on the edge of disaster, and he wasn’t even\nallowed to speak to the rest of his Lancers. He wondered where Jackal had\ngotten to—if he’d managed to locate Ibana—and when or if he’d return.\nStyke stared at his big skull ring, twirling it absently.\nIn the Quorum Hall, Etzi thundered on. Etzi was in a fury—he spoke\npassionately about the need for oversight of the emperor’s tools, for the\nreduction of Ka-Sedial’s local power, and for the legal loopholes that\nallowed the bone-eyes to operate with impunity.

He’d seen it on a map of the world, of course,\nbut his entire experience had been limited to the eastern coast—and just a\ntiny sliver of that. Dynize was as big as the Nine, and though the people\nshared a common racial identity, it became clear that they were much\ndivided. Of thirty total provinces, four in the west were already in open\nrevolt after having their resources stripped by Ka-Sedial to fund the\nFatrastan War. Another seven had sent envoys to the capital to request that\nKa-Sedial be forced into retirement.\nThis was, as Etzi had put it, a powder keg. He hoped to control it. Styke\nwas beginning to think that getting out of the capital and waiting for it to\nblow up might be his best option—but he had no idea how to do so.\nOne thing at a time, he reminded himself as he listened to one of Etzi’s\nenemies rail against the “weak-willed mice” that would see the empire\ncrumble. He recognized that rhetoric well. It was used by politicians and\ntheir financiers when they stood to gain from the continuation of conflict. It\nwas the same rhetoric Lindet had used to silence her enemies just after the\nrevolution—though she had used it to justify the formation of the secret\npolice rather than continue a foreign war.\nKa-Sedial and his allies, Styke realized, needed this war to tighten their\npower. The emperor was either their puppet or he was impotent. Styke\ncouldn’t help but wonder how long until, like Lindet and her Blackhats, Ka-\nSedial turned the knives against his internal enemies.\nAs soon as the war was won, he imagined.\nHis thoughts were cut off when the impassioned speeches gave way to\nthe quiet roar of hundreds of people breaking out in small discussions.\nStyke turned to see Etzi emerge from the Quorum Hall. Etzi walked with\npurpose, his head up and face flushed, looking like a man who could see\nsome sort of victory on the horizon, but when he got closer, Styke noted the\nsmall signs of exhaustion—the crow’s feet, the drooping shoulders, the\ndeep, slow breaths.\nEtzi scowled as he approached. “I’ve asked them to bring you a chair\nevery day for three days.” He glanced over his shoulder. “They refuse to do\nit. What kind of petty…”\nStyke waved it off. “How are the debates going?”\n“Well, I think,” Etzi said, running a hand through his hair and then\nstraightening his formal tunic. “The debates themselves are.” He shrugged,\nas if to say only slightly more than unimportant. “It’s these moments of\ndiscussion that are important. We have a ten-minute recess for toilet and\nrefreshment, but most everyone will remain in the Hall discussing the\ndebates, forging deals, strengthening alliances—or preparing to break\nthem.”"

        "text": "discussion that are important. We have a ten-minute recess for toilet and\nrefreshment, but most everyone will remain in the Hall discussing the\ndebates, forging deals, strengthening alliances—or preparing to break\nthem.”\n“I’m not experienced in politics, but doesn’t all of that happen in\nprivate?” Styke had been to plenty of Lindet’s parties during the war, and\nhe’d been keen enough to realize that’s where all the important dealing\nhappened.\n“Yes,” Etzi confirmed, “but the groundwork for them will be laid here. A\nglance, a gesture, a few token words—they’re all just preparations for later\nmeetings. This evening will be a busy one. The Quorum has spent the last\nfew days trying to decide how they feel about your man’s execution.”\nStyke forced himself to contain his anger at the fresh wound. “I haven’t\neven heard my name spoken, let alone the event discussed.”\n“Formally?” Etzi asked, shaking his head. “Of course not. No one wants\nto be on the record directly addressing the emperor’s justice. But we’ll talk\nabout overreach and Sedial’s position of power.”\n“So it’s all between the lines?”\n“And in private, yes.”\n“So…” Styke ground his teeth. “What does everyone think?”\nEtzi cleared his throat, avoiding Styke’s gaze. “Everyone thinks that Ji-\nPatten was within his rights to execute a foreigner convicted of murder.”\n“I—” Styke began angrily.\nEtzi cut him off. “However, they’re not stupid. Everyone, even Sedial’s\nallies, acknowledge that the judgment was less than legitimate and the\nexecution of the sentence rushed. Ji-Patten made that obvious when he tried\nto provoke you after the fact.”\nStyke rubbed his chin. He could still feel the sting of the slap, and the\nspot on his chest that Ji-Patten had full-on punched had developed into a\nbruise that looked like he’d been kicked by a mule. “Are they going to do\nanything about it?”\n“Actively? They can’t. But it has convinced several of the unaligned\nHouseholds that Sedial is out of control.”\n“That’s not good enough.” Styke could hear the anger in his voice, tried\nto rein it in, and did not succeed.\nTo his surprise, Etzi smirked.\n“What?” Styke demanded.\n“It’s…” Etzi tilted his head, as if considering his words. “Ji-Patten\nstruck you. Three times.”\n“So?”\n“And you laughed at him. Belittled him. Any other time they might have\ntaken that as an insult against the emperor, but considering the current\nclimate, the fact that you spat in the face of a dragonman has garnered you\nquite the following.”\n“In the Hall?” Styke asked in confusion. He had done his best to hold on\nto his anger but had still expected the political fallout to go poorly for him.\n“In the Hall. In the public. Word leaked. Those roving mobs that have\nbeen killing foreigners and some of my men? One of them was attacked by\nanother band this morning. They tore each other to shreds. I don’t have any\ninterest in mobs of any kind wandering the capital, but it gives me a distinct\namount of pleasure to hear that the common people won’t just lie down for\nSedial’s paid thugs.”"

One of his cupbearers has been arming and paying unemployed\ncitizens to attack foreign slaves. An ally of mine is going to gather\nwitnesses and prepare a suit against the cupbearer for inciting insurrection.”\nStyke bit his tongue, cutting off an outburst about lawsuits, lawyers, and\npoliticians. Etzi had made it very clear that he and his allies didn’t want to\nreignite the civil war—that their intention was to use the law to destroy\nSedial’s power base. But Styke had followed this kind of naivety in the\nnewspapers during his own sister’s rise to power. She had won because she\nhad kept her enemies engaged with lawyers of her own, and all while\nconducting an operation of blackmail, spying, and violence on the sly.\nIf Sedial was anything like Lindet, he wouldn’t allow Etzi’s long game\nto continue for enough time to actually do real damage. Though, to be fair,\nSedial was on a whole different continent and distracted by a war. Maybe,\nStyke allowed himself to hope, just maybe Etzi’s people could play this\ngame through to the end.\nEtzi reached up and patted Styke on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, my\nfriend. Sedial is losing the unaligned Households. The winds are shifting.\nMy mother and your man will be avenged.”\n“Will they?” Styke asked quietly.\n“I promise.” With that, Etzi gave a nod to himself and then turned to\nhead back inside the Quorum Hall.\nStyke sagged against the wall, watching him go. He had no doubt that\nEtzi was on his side—though he still wasn’t sure he wouldn’t be thrown\nunder the turnip cart if push came to shove. His fear was that Etzi would\nlose.\nStyke considered what Valyaine had told him back in Bellport. About\nhow the Mad Lancers had been monsters, using the war to sate their base\ndesires. The words rang truer the more Styke thought about them, but he\nalso knew that without her own monsters, Fatrasta would never have won\nthe war against a bigger, meaner nation. He was a necessary evil.\nEtzi didn’t have that necessary evil. He didn’t want it, didn’t think he\nneeded it. But Styke had his own agenda, his own vengeance to be had.\nA small group emerged from the Quorum Hall, and Styke looked up at\nthem coolly. It was Ji-Patten, escorted by four of his black-clad soldiers.\nStyke resisted the urge to reach for his knife. They marched down the center\nof the hallway, and it became clear that they weren’t going to acknowledge\nStyke’s presence.\n“You ever heard of a dragonman by the name of Ji-Kushel?” Styke\nasked in Dynize.\nJi-Patten took several more steps before slowing. He gestured to his\nmen, who came to a stop around him."

        "text": "asked in Dynize.\nJi-Patten took several more steps before slowing. He gestured to his\nmen, who came to a stop around him.\n“Ask one of your boss’s puppets what I did to Ji-Kushel. Then ask him\nwhat I did to the dragonmen who he sent to avenge Ji-Kushel. Ask him why\nhe hates me so much.”\n“Wait for me outside.” The order came in a clipped, emotionless tone. Ji-\nPatten’s escort responded without hesitation, marching on to leave him and\nStyke alone in the hallway. Once they’d gone, Ji-Patten turned toward\nStyke. “What did you do to Ji-Kushel?”\n“We dueled.”\nJi-Patten’s nostrils flared.\nStyke continued, “It took me all day to clean his brains out of my ring.\nSedial dug up Orz and five other disgraced dragonmen and sent them after\nme. I killed two of them. The rest died fighting my people.” He leaned\nforward. “You’re not special.”\n“We have the blessings of the bone-eyes.”\n“Little good it did any of you. Sedial doesn’t just hate me. He fears me.\nHe fears anything stronger than one of his precious dragonmen.”\nJi-Patten stiffened. “You’re not stronger than a dragonman.”\n“I’ve got three notches on my knife that say otherwise,” Styke told him.\n“Ask Sedial. Or one of his puppets, or however the pit you communicate\nwith him.”\n“You’re trying to provoke me.”\n“What? Like that weak slap you gave me the other day?” Styke gave\nhim a toothy grin, trying to make sure it looked insolent rather than leaking\nout the pure rage inside him. He didn’t want to give Ji-Patten the\nsatisfaction of knowing how close he’d come to succeeding. “No. I’ve been\ntold that you don’t duel here in Dynize, so there’s no point in provoking\nyou. Didn’t bother Ji-Kushel, but I guess he was on another continent.”\nStyke shrugged. “I’m just letting you know that Sedial is trying to cover for\nyour brotherhood. He tried to avenge their honor and only made things\nworse.”\nHe saw a flicker in Ji-Patten’s eyes, but the dragonman didn’t betray\nanything else. They stared at each other for several moments, until the quiet\nroar of discussion in the Quorum Hall subsided and Etzi began another\nlong, passionate speech.\n“Your men are waiting for you,” Styke said, jerking his head toward the\nexit. “Be a good dog and go terrorize whoever else Sedial doesn’t like.”\nJi-Patten snorted, then pivoted on one foot and headed for the exit\nwithout a word. Styke didn’t bother watching him leave. He let his head fall\nback against the wall, feeling the tension in his own shoulders and letting\nout a deep breath. He would have to wait a few more hours until Etzi\nfinished with the Quorum for the day. But he wouldn’t need to come back\ntomorrow.\nHis message had been delivered.\nCHAPTER 50\nM\nichel worked his way along the back of a crowd in Upper Landfall.

        "text": "His message had been delivered.\nCHAPTER 50\nM\nichel worked his way along the back of a crowd in Upper Landfall. He\nwas surprised at the size of it—thousands of people, mostly Palo, waving\nsigns and shouting slogans. They took up the entire center of the square,\nwith even more marching in a continuous circle around them. Everyone was\nangry, and he couldn’t help but feel a confused mix of pride, guilt, and\nterror.\nPride because he’d organized the anger behind this protest. Guilt\nbecause he knew that eventually people were going to get hurt.\nAnd terrified because the Sons of the Red Hand had nothing to do with\nthis gathering. The anger that he’d stirred up by having Survivor tell his\nstory around the Depths had taken on a mind of its own. He’d nudged\ncommunity leaders, conducted an enormous propaganda campaign, and\npaid hundreds of gossips to spread the word, but this… this wasn’t him. He\ncould feel the vibrato of the furious crowd deep in his chest. He could sense\nthe impending violence.\nThe protest was, if he wasn’t mistaken, occurring in the very same\npublic square where the Blackhats executed the decoy Mama Palo earlier in\nthe year. He wondered if that had been planned, or if this was some kind of\ncoincidence. He wondered if anyone even remembered the poor old\nwoman.\nHe continued to stay near the edges of the mob, but made his way\ntoward the bandstands set up to one side of the square. A few dozen Palo\nwere already on them, speaking among themselves or shouting back and\nforth to whip up the crowd. Michel recognized many of them as prominent\nspeakers, activists, and leaders of the Palo community. None of them were\nas rich or powerful as Meln-Dun had been before his fall, but they were still\na force to be reckoned with.\nOnce Michel had found himself a good spot to listen to the speeches, he\ncraned his head toward the nearby streets. Stone-faced Dynize soldiers were\nalready gathered in tight knots on the roads or positioned on the rooftops.\nTheir muskets were still shouldered, but Michel knew how quickly that\nwould change. He hoped that nothing here turned violent and rethought his\nown positioning in the crowd.\nBetter to not be able to hear very well but have a clean exit than to get\ncaught up in a stampede if this got nasty.\nHe repositioned himself near a wide alley just as a shush went through\nthe crowd. One of the men on the bandstand approached the podium. He\nclutched a speech in one hand and waved with the other, looking out over\nthe assembled masses with a stern visage.\nHe introduced himself as Horiallen, and Michel remembered that he\nowned a mill that provided most of the grain to Greenfire Depths. Jiniel had\nmet with him two days ago.\n“My friends!” he began. “Thank you for joining me here today, for a\nshow of solidarity.” There was a cheer that quickly died out. “We’ve\ngathered as a people to ask questions of the new rulers of Landfall—to\ndemand answers.” He pointed at a particularly prominent group of mounted\nDynize soldiers watching from nearby. “Vicious rumors are being spread\nabout our new overlords. These whispers are almost too horrible for me to\nmention, but I know for a fact that we’ve all heard them by now. Rumors"

        "text": "about our new overlords. These whispers are almost too horrible for me to\nmention, but I know for a fact that we’ve all heard them by now. Rumors\nabout Dynize sorcery. Rumors about blood sacrifice!” His voice rose to a\nfever pitch. The crowd grumbled, people shifting about angrily.\n“We want to know if these rumors are true! We want to know who will\npay for the blood of our children and our grandparents!”\nThe grumbling grew louder. Shouts of agreement rose from the crowd.\nMichel looked around nervously and took a few steps back. The tension\nwas thick enough to chew on, and it wouldn’t be long before some damned\nfools tried to vent their anger on the watching Dynize soldiers. He swore\nunder his breath, but the word caught in his throat as someone suddenly\nclutched him by the wrist.\nHe spun, his other hand digging into his pocket for his knuckledusters,\nonly to find himself face-to-face with Tenik. His eyes darted around,\nlooking for some sign of an ambush, but it quickly became apparent that\nTenik was alone. It was also apparent, for anyone who looked under the hat\nthat Tenik had pulled down over his face, that he was a Dynize in a sea of\nangry Palo.\n“What are you doing here?” Michel asked, taking a step back to stand\nbeside Tenik.\n“Looking for you.” Tenik replied in Adran but spoke in a low voice,\nclearly conscious of his accent. He let go of Michel’s wrist and leaned\nheavily on his cane.\n“This is not a good place for you,” Michel warned.\n“I’m just figuring that out. I feel like we’re on the edge of a damned riot.\nIs this your doing?”\n“In part. But I don’t have any control of it anymore.” Someone nearby\nscowled at Tenik. Michel took him by the shoulder and steered him through\nthe crowd. “Keep moving. We don’t want anyone to notice what you are.\nPit, if you need to talk, we probably should get out of here.”\n“We definitely should get out of here.”\n“Palo making you nervous?” Michel asked lightly.\n“Yes. And Sedial has sent four hundred cudgel-armed thugs to disperse\nthe crowd. It’s going to get really bad really fast. If I hadn’t found you just\nnow, I would have left myself.”\n“Shit.” Michel turned, steering them back toward the alley he’d picked\nout as his escape route earlier. The crowd cheered at the speaker, drowning\nout whatever it was that Tenik said next. It took them a couple of minutes,\nbut they soon broke through the marchers and headed into the alley. They\nwere just turning the corner when Michel caught sight of a greater number\nof Dynize soldiers arriving on horseback at the other end of the square.\n“Just in time,” he muttered.\nMichel and Tenik emerged onto the next street. It was still crowded here,\nwith people trying to hear what was going on in the square, but they were\nable to walk without shoving their way through the press. He heard a loud\nvoice echoing behind him, as if amplified by sorcery, telling the crowd to\ndisperse. An angry roar answered it.\n“Faster,” Michel said, offering Tenik his arm.

Tenik took it and limped\nalong quickly as they made their escape. The angry shouts of the crowd\nwere soon interspersed with screams. A ripple of fear went down the street.\nA few people began running toward the sounds. More began running away.\nThey managed to find a safe place out of the way in a burned-out\nbuilding on the rim of Greenfire Depths. Tenik sank down to the ground,\nbreathing heavily, one hand on his damaged leg and a grimace on his face.\nMichel listened to the distant sounds of the chaos. No gunshots so far. That\nwas good, at least. “The damned fools.”\n“Who? The people protesting or the ones who showed up to deal with\nit?”\nMichel looked down at Tenik and said, “Both. The protesters should\nhave held their march down in the Depths, where they’d be less likely to be\ninterfered with. And the Dynize…” Michel spat. “They’re just going to\nmake things worse.”\n“What do you expect them to do?” Tenik asked. The question came\nacross as petulant. The protest had clearly shaken him, even if he hadn’t\nalready been inclined to side with his countrymen.\nMichel didn’t answer the question. He offered Tenik a hand, pulling him\nback to his feet. “This rumor going around about the street children and\nblood sacrifices. Is it true?” Tenik asked.\n“What do you think?” Michel glanced at his friend sidelong.\nTenik shifted uncomfortably from his good leg to his bad one and back\nagain. “I can’t say I’d be surprised.”\n“It’s true.”\n“You’re sure?”\nMichel nodded.\nTenik rambled off a number of curses in Dynize. “How does Sedial hope\nto contain this? The arrogant piece of shit, he…” His voice began to rise,\nbut he seemed to catch himself. He turned to Michel. “Once again, the Yaret\nHousehold is in your debt.”\nMichel frowned. “In what way?”\n“The very night that you warned us about the purge orders, they came\nfor Yaret.”\n“An assassination attempt?”\n“A squad of six of them. We had already tripled our guard, and yet they\nstill killed nine of us and wounded that number again. Yaret barely escaped\nwith his life.” Tenik bit his lip so hard that it drew blood. “Sedial tried to\nkill my master, Michel! If you hadn’t warned us, he would have succeeded.\nIf he had sent a couple of dragonmen, my entire Household would already\nbe dead.”\nMichel felt the thrill of Tenik’s anger and tried not to let himself get\nswept up in it. “You’re sure they were Sedial’s men?”\n“We identified two of them. More than enough to be certain.”\n“I thought the whole point of the purge order was so he could legally sic\nhis soldiers on you.”\nTenik winced. “It is.

No doubt fearful that the orders might end up in someone else’s\nhands.” Tenik took an unsteady breath. “If not for your interference, we\nwould all be dead.”\n“You can thank a light-fingered maid,” Michel replied. He ran his hands\nthrough his hair and began to pace. The roar of an angry crowd had died\ndown now, replaced by more screaming. Even many blocks away, he could\nsee people rushing back and forth out in the street.\n“Sedial’s trying not to kill anyone,” Tenik explained, gesturing back\ntoward the square. “He’s not a fool. He’s hoping that a few hundred\nbeatings might send the message for the Palo not to ask too many\nquestions.”\nMichel wondered if it would work. Perhaps. The Palo had been cowed\nbefore by Kressians, and then by Lindet. They could be cowed again. But\nthey’d had a taste of real freedom under the Dynize. He wondered if they’d\nlet that go.\n“They’re going to try again.”\nMichel turned his attention back to Tenik. “The assassins?”\n“Doubtlessly. Sedial does not give up, and he’s already moving forward.\nThree major Household heads have been found dead in the last three days.\nOne of the killings was definitely an assassination. The other two were\nmade up to look like a mugging and an accident, respectively.”\n“Do your people believe it?”\n“Some of them,” Tenik admitted. “Some of Sedial’s allies will no doubt\nbe in on it. There are plenty of good people on his side—people who’d\nnever back him if they knew for certain what he was up to—but they also\nbelieve anything he says. A lot of bodies would have to pile up before they\nbelieved that this was really a purge.”\n“So they’re as bad as any one of his other allies.”\n“For now, yes. Yaret is reaching out quietly, trying to rally some\nopposition and inject doubt into the more honorable members of Sedial’s\ninner circle. I don’t know if it will help.” Tenik leaned over to rub his leg\nand wound up bent over, limp, his eyes shut. Michel could see the\nhopelessness in Tenik’s body language: He probably believed he was\nalready dead.\n“Is there really nothing Yaret can do to defend himself?”\n“If Sedial wants us dead, he will have us dead,” Tenik answered. “That\ndoesn’t mean we won’t fight back, but…” He trailed off for a moment.\n“Yaret’s cousin is one of our most celebrated generals. She’s in charge of a\nfield army up north, chasing after Lady Flint. We’ve sent word to her about\nthe assassination attempt. She’s our closest ally, but I’m not sure if there’s\nanything she can do to help us short of marching her entire army down here\nto demand that Sedial stop the purge. And I don’t think she’s going to do\nthat.”\n“What if I can buy you more time?” Michel asked, a thought beginning\nto form in his head.\nTenik looked up sharply. “How?”\n“I’m not completely sure. But I might be able to hide you—to give you"

But I might be able to hide you—to give you\ntime to negotiate, or rally Sedial’s enemies, or just wait out the purge until\nyou can escape to Yaret’s cousin.”\nTenik snorted. “That’s impossible. You’d have to hide several hundred\nimmediate Household members. Maybe more, if we pull some of our\nmilitary officers out of the infantry. The rest are too low-ranking to require\nprotection—Sedial won’t bother assassinating them—but hundreds of\npeople. Where could you possibly put us?”\nMichel stifled a smile. Tenik was in such deep despair that he couldn’t\nsee the answer hiding literally right under his nose. “Are the Yaret\nHousehold still the only ones who have all the maps of the catacombs?”\n“What maps you didn’t steal when you—” A wave of shock swept\nacross Tenik’s face, followed by a gasp of relief. “Damn you, Michel. How\nthe pit did I not see that?” He stood up straight, like he’d been animated by\nsome new strength. “Those catacombs are endless. We could disappear\nwithout Sedial even noticing, and even if he did, we could hold out in there\nfor weeks. He’d have to send Privileged in to find us, and he doesn’t have\nany to spare.” He began to pace, leaning heavily on his cane, talking\nquickly. “We’d need to pack up our valuables. Take food, bedding, lanterns,\nrope. Spread everyone out to avoid the bad air. It’ll take planning and\nlogistics, but we could do it. There’s an entrance not far from the\nHousehold. We could all disappear within days.”\n“I can lend a little help for the logistics,” Michel offered, though he\nknew that Jiniel would slap him if she heard him say so. The Sons of the\nRed Hand already had way too much work for their existing plans. They\ncouldn’t afford to take in hundreds of strays. But he was already working\nthrough the argument he’d give to her lieutenants: allies among the Dynize.\nA bona fide source of intelligence, straight from the Minister of Scrolls.\nAdding kindling to a budding Dynize civil war.\nAnd, it would let him save some friends that he desperately wanted to\nhelp.\nHe pulled out a scrap of paper and a nub of pencil. “Send two of your\nmost trusted people to this address,” he said, scribbling. “We can coordinate\ngetting your people off the streets and well hidden. We might even put some\nof them in the Depths. I’ll see what we can spare in supplies.”\nTenik took the paper, but a sudden reservation crossed his face.\n“What is it?” Michel asked.\n“You… you don’t have to do this.”\n“I know.”\n“But you’re doing it anyway. I didn’t ask for help. Yaret sent me to do\nso, and I was getting around to it, but I hadn’t actually asked.”\n“I don’t need to make you ask,” Michel said reassuringly. He reached\nout, patting Tenik on the shoulder. “Like I told you before. I’m a spy, not a\nmonster.”\n“But…”\n“You were—you are—my friend, Tenik. Yaret was, for a small moment,"

The\nscreaming had all but died down now. He could still hear the occasional\nrough shout of a soldier. Somewhere nearby, a window shattered. “How\nlong have you been standing there?” he asked.\nIchtracia emerged from the shadows of a brick building just around the\ncorner from where Tenik had been standing. She pursed her lips and looked\ntoward the street. “I followed the two of you from the protest.”\n“And you didn’t want to announce yourself?” Michel should have been\nmad, but he was mostly bemused. He was actually a little proud of her—\nstaying silent, listening in on a conversation, sneaking about; she was\nbecoming a better spy every day.\n“I was curious what you’d talk about. Also I wanted to make sure that\nTenik wasn’t trying to lead you into some kind of trap. Do you trust him?”\n“I do,” Michel replied. “But I’m also going to check with Emerald and\ntry to verify his claims. The last thing I need is to be suckered into helping\nthem only to find out that Yaret or Tenik have been turned into puppets by\nSedial.”\n“Be careful.”\n“I will,” Michel promised. “Thank you for watching out for me again.”\nShe smirked at him. “How did you know I was around the corner?”\n“I could see your shadow.”\nShe looked back to her hiding spot and rolled her eyes. “Damn it. I\nthought I’d done so well, too. How did you know it was me and not\nsomeone else?”\n“You have a, uh, particular shape. Even your shadow.”\nIchtracia snorted. “Right. I’ll have to remember that. You think that\nprotest has died down?”\n“Sounds like Sedial’s thugs are still chasing people off. But I’m guessing\nwe’re far enough away that we’ll be fine.”\n“Good.” She fiddled with her vest pockets where she kept her hidden\nPrivileged gloves. “Let’s go find something to eat. Spycraft makes me\nhungry.”\nCHAPTER 51\nV\nlora was more than a little surprised to get a visit from Delia Snowbound\nin the middle of the afternoon.

Norrine announced Delia, and Vlora, startled by the suddenness\nof it, forgot to pretend that she wasn’t around.\nDelia swept the tent flap aside and stepped in, turning her head quickly\nto take in Vlora’s residence as if inspecting the lair of some great beast. She\ngave Vlora a brisk nod and clasped her hands behind her back, standing\nformally just inside the flap.\nVlora blinked at her, pulling her own thoughts out of her plans and then\nclearing away several of her maps and notes from her spare chair. “Lady\nSnowbound. This is unexpected. Please have a seat.”\nDelia glanced at the chair as if it were a scorpion. She gave Vlora a\ngrimace that was probably supposed to be a smile, then crossed the tent in a\nfew overly brisk steps and sank into the offered seat. She put her hands on\nher knees, raised her chin, and looked around at everything except at Vlora\nherself.\nVlora took a deep breath. “What can I do for you?”\n“Lady Flint. I wanted to let you know how the negotiations are going.”\n“Oh?” Vlora had last gotten an update from Sabastenien yesterday\nmorning. Unless she was mistaken, Delia had more meetings this morning\nand she expected to hear Sabastenien’s opinion of them later tonight. She\ndidn’t bother to cut Delia off, though. It would be interesting to hear her\nversion of events.\n“You’ve put me in quite the pickle.”\nVlora pursed her lips and braced herself for a lecture.\nDelia continued. “We have three armies bearing down on us, and they\nhave finally received orders from Landfall on how to deal with us. While\nthey do have room to negotiate, it seems the three generals are in agreement\nthat they don’t actually need to negotiate. They feel their armies are more\nthan enough to deal with our one. They’d rather try their luck at a battle\nthan give up anything.”\n“That does sound like the Dynize I’ve gotten used to dealing with.”\n“That’s why I’m here.” Delia took a deep breath, looking around\nnervously again before finally seeming to relax into her seat with a\nfrustrated sigh. “We need to talk strategy. Whatever hate exists between us\nneeds to be set aside so we can discuss our situation frankly.”\n“I’m not the one with all the hate.” The words slipped out before Vlora\ncould rethink them.\n“Because it wasn’t your family who was slaughtered,” Delia snapped.\nShe visibly wrestled control of herself and her tone returned to normal.\n“Yes, I hate you. I hate your family. I hate everyone who helped Tamas in\nhis bloody coup. But I’m not a fool. We are in a dire situation and I need\nyour help resolving it.”\nVlora didn’t let herself rise to the bait. Tamas is dead, she wanted to say.\nBesides, your parents were a part of the old system that had to die. Instead,\nshe plastered a neutral expression on her face. “Go on.”\n“As I said, the Dynize do not believe they need to negotiate.

I have\ngiven them generous terms and reminded them that furthering this conflict\nincreases the chances of the Nine getting involved. They don’t seem to be\nall that worried about the latter—it would take the better part of a year for\nanyone to raise an army and then sail it here, after all, and the Dynize seem\nto think all of this will be wrapped up by then.”\n“What do you think?” Vlora asked.\n“I think they’re mad. Whatever crimes were committed by the general\nstaff and Magus Borbador to get us involved… well, those will be dealt\nwith later. And whatever I think about the Adran Army’s role in the coup,\nyou are still the best in the world. They should be treading lightly around\nus. Instead they are preparing to attack.”\nVlora stiffened. Her last report put all three of the Dynize armies\nholding about five miles away from the river, arrayed in a semicircle. She\nhad a few companies down to their south to keep the Dynize from fording\nthe river for a flanking action, but otherwise there’d been no conflict.\n“You’re sure?”\n“I’m dealing with generals right now instead of politicians, and they are\nnot good at concealing their intentions. If they wanted a deal, they’d be\nnegotiating more aggressively. But they aren’t.”\n“What, exactly, are they asking for?”\nDelia pursed her lips. “They want your head, for starters.”\n“I see.” Vlora sighed. This again. Sedial’s petty idiocy.\n“As much as I’d enjoy handing it over, I have neither the authority to do\nsuch a thing nor, in the end, would I. You are an Adran citizen.”\n“Thank you.”\n“Don’t thank me. I’m just doing my job.” Delia tapped one finger\nagainst her knee. “They’re also asking for complete disarmament. They\nwant us to hand over everything more dangerous than a bread knife, march\nstraight back to our fleet, and depart for Adro without looking back.\nPersonally, I think we’re in a better position than that. The fleet still\ncommands the waters on this side of Fatrasta and despite our numerical\ninferiority, we are the Adran Army.”\nIt amused Vlora to hear Delia express so much confidence in her\nsoldiers, and Vlora found a tiny part of her warming to the woman. She\nquashed that warmth. Always be on the lookout for a trap from a person like\nthis. “Your assessment goes along the same lines as mine,” Vlora said\nslowly.\n“I thought as much. But even so, I need to ask you directly: If we are\nbeset upon by these three armies, do we have any hope of winning?”\nDirect and to the point. Vlora leaned back in her chair, puffing out her\ncheeks and letting out a long, thoughtful breath. She looked around at her\nmess of a tent. Notes and maps everywhere, a dozen different plans of battle\nsketched out as well as a dozen contingencies for each of them. So much\npreparation time was a luxury she hadn’t had for months, but the Dynize\nwere treating her carefully now and taking the time to make their own\nplans. She grimaced.\n“This is not a fight I want,” Vlora said."

I just said that I don’t want to fight it,” Vlora said.\n“We can win. We’ve beaten worse odds before.”\n“Against the Kez, who didn’t have blood sorcerers.”\n“Blood sorcerers die just as easily as Privileged, and I still have my\npowder mages,” Vlora said. “The bone-eyes don’t concern me. The\nnumbers do, but we have our backs to the river and several hundred\nkeelboats that allow us to ferry men quickly. We control the only bridge for\ntens of miles. Our guns are now on the hillside behind us, putting them out\nof enemy reach but in position to blast their own artillery to pit should they\nattempt to bring it forward. And at the end of the day, both our infantry and\nour cavalry are better than theirs.”\nDelia sat in silence, absorbing the information. After a few moments,\nshe said, “You didn’t mention Nila and Bo.”\n“They’ll have their hands full of the enemy Privileged for the beginning\nof the battle. But once my powder mages have neutralized them…”\n“Nila’s fire.”\n“Nila’s fire,” Vlora confirmed. “The Dynize still haven’t figured out just\nhow big of a gap there is between their combat abilities and our own.\nPowder mages are too powerful a trump card, and they don’t want to accept\nthat.” She paused, considering General Etepali. The old woman had shown\nmore freethinking and wiliness than her allies, but she had yet to live up to\nthe reputation she’d claimed upon their first meeting. Either she had\nexaggerated her own abilities or she still had tricks up her sleeve. Vlora\nwasn’t looking forward to finding out.\n“But you said you don’t want to fight,” Delia said.\n“I did. Because whatever happens, I will lose a great many soldiers. I\ncare about my soldiers.”\n“You think the losses will be worth the victory?”\nVlora clenched her teeth. This conversation had revealed something, and\nshe suddenly put her finger on it. Delia was still negotiating as if this were a\nregular war. She didn’t understand the severity of what they were fighting\nfor. “Any losses are worth it, Lady Snowbound. If the Dynize are able to\ncreate a new god, they won’t just win this war. They will reign supreme\nover the entire hemisphere. They will cause upheaval that reaches the Nine\nand beyond.”\nDelia gazed back at Vlora, and it was in this gaze that Vlora began to\nsuspect that Delia wasn’t ignorant of this—she simply didn’t believe it.\nVlora opened her mouth to continue, but shut it again. Delia hadn’t met\nKresimir. She hadn’t experienced the beginning of this current war. She had\nno context to put this in except for simple politics. Vlora found herself\nsuddenly terrified.\nShe didn’t want a dogmatic believer. Those tended to be dangerous in\ntheir own right.

A healthy\ndose of helplessness joined her terror. She resisted the urge to argue. She\ndidn’t have the time or the energy. All she could do was attempt to steer\nDelia using her own methods.\n“Are you going to attack them?” Delia asked suddenly.\nVlora hesitated. It wasn’t that she didn’t trust Delia, but Vlora didn’t\nwant her to know all of her plans. “I’m going to play this defensively. If I\ndo, we can win. I agree with you that the Dynize terms are unacceptable.”\n“Good.” The word was clipped, final. Delia stood up and gave Vlora\nthat same grimace-like smile. “That is what I needed to know. I will\nsuspend negotiations until after the battle. If we can defeat them when\noutnumbered three against one, I suspect they will be on the verge of giving\nus anything we want.”\nVlora waited until Delia was gone to let out a scoff of disbelief. This\nwas pure, sharklike politics. Nothing more, nothing less. A tiny part of\nVlora could respect that. Envy it, even. But there wasn’t room here for\nplaying politics. If she won this coming fight, she’d give Delia the\nammunition to end the war on whatever terms she wanted. And if she didn’t\nwin… well, they’d all be dead anyway.\nVlora waited about ten minutes before she left her tent and headed\nacross the river to the pedestal. She found Prime, Nila, and Bo with their\nheads close together, huddled on the far side of the keelboat, examining a\nbit of writing. “Anything?” she asked.\nBo waved her off without looking up. “We’re working on it,” he said\nwith a strong note of irritation. “We’ll let you know as soon as we find out.”\nVlora left the keelboat and paced on shore, feeling a sudden desperate\nneed to do something. Her first instinct was to plan an attack—to launch\nsomething bold against one of the three armies hemming them in, in an\neffort to even the playing field. She resisted that urge—it was a trick she\ndare not attempt again with Etepali present—and instead headed back to her\ntent, to where her plans and contingencies were. She needed to prepare for\nanything.\nShe paused just outside her tent, one of those contingencies floating at\nthe corner of her mind. “Davd,” she asked her shadowing mage, “any news\non those keelboats?”\n“We’ve got around three hundred of them,” Davd said.\nThe keelboats were packed into the river behind them, hidden by a\nsorcerous fog, courtesy of Bo. The enemy knew she had them, of course,\nbut she didn’t want the enemy to know how many were there. They factored\ninto several different contingencies and might prove to be the crux of a\ncoming battle. “Still two hundred short,” she muttered. “Tell me if we find\nany more,” she said, heading into her tent.\nThat talk with Delia should have calmed her nerves.

Instead she found\nherself trembling with excitement and trepidation.\nCHAPTER 52\nS\ntyke woke to a gentle knock on his door and opened it to find Jerio\nstanding in the moonlight outside, holding something up to him. Styke\nlooked around. It was probably two in the morning and no one else was\naround. The night watchman’s torch flickered off the walls of the\ncompound, and a single gas lamp in the corridor illuminated the side of the\nboy’s face.\n“What is it?” Styke whispered.\nJerio bobbed his hand up and down until Styke reached out and took the\ncard. “This was delivered for you at the front gate. I’m assisting the\nwatchman tonight, so…” He trailed off, watching while Styke turned the\ncard in his hands and then opened it.\n“Who delivered it?” Styke had to step out of the doorway, closing the\ndoor behind him quietly, and walk over to the gas lamp to read the writing.\nIt simply said, Unity Square. There was nothing else on the paper.\nJerio looked over his shoulder. His eyes widened slightly, and he replied\nin a whisper, “Their face was covered, but… I think it was a dragonman.”\n“Why do you think that?” Styke asked, looking sharply at the boy.\nJerio hesitated a moment before touching both his wrists. “Tattoos.”\nStyke clutched the card in his fingertips. Most people might consider\nthis a strange cypher, but he’d been a fighter long enough to know exactly\nwhat it was: a challenge. It was not only unsurprising; it was expected. His\ndiscussion with Ji-Patten had been a thrown gauntlet. The dragonman had\njust answered.\nStyke’s heart immediately began to hammer, his fingers twitching and\nhis rage building. He could practically taste the fight—the blood on his lips,\nthe knife in his hand, tearing at Ji-Patten like a wild animal. The satisfaction\nof vengeance in a gruesome kill was at his fingertips. He had to consciously\nkeep himself from grinning like a lunatic. “Did you read this?” he asked.\nJerio shook his head.\n“Did the night watchman?”\nAnother shake of the head.\n“Good kid. Where can I find Unity Square?”\nJerio had to repeat the directions twice for Styke to really understand\nthem in Dynize. The square wasn’t far—a handful of city blocks—but from\nthe mental map he’d created of the city he was fairly certain that it was an\nisolated public space surrounded on three sides by water. A good spot for a\nduel. He dismissed Jerio and returned to his room, where he began to\nquietly dress. His mind churned with strategies and worries. Was this an\nambush? Would Ji-Patten come alone? Would Styke be able to win this\nfight? What happened if he lost?\nThe last thought buzzed around in the back of his head like a persistent\nfly. It wasn’t a familiar worry—he never really considered it as an option.\nHe was, after all, Ben Styke. Even without Ka-poel’s sorcery, he had\nsmashed a dragonman’s head in with his ring.\nWas that luck? a little voice asked. What if luck turned the other way?"

He sought to\nmentally bury the voice. Risk be damned. There was vengeance to be had.\nStyke’s eyes fell on Celine’s sleeping form. She was snuggled up against\nKa-poel in the spare bed, both of them snoring softly. He thought of the set\nof horses he was still carving for her and her friends, and scowled down at\nthe boz knife lying on the floor between his bare feet. He thought of the\nidea that Celine had friends—it was the first time since he’d taken her\nunder his wing at the labor camp that he’d seen her thrive with children her\nown age.\nHe never made a conscious decision. One moment he was picking up his\nknife, ready to head to the next fight. The next, he was kneeling beside the\nbed, his brow furrowed in a scowl, reaching out gently to touch a shoulder.\n“Ka-poel,” he said softly.\nHer eyes opened, reflecting the moonlight coming in through the\nwindow. He gave her a moment to extract herself from Celine and climb out\nof the bed. They both went into the compound corridor outside, where he\ncould see her hands. What is it? she asked.\n“The dragonman, Ji-Patten. Have you made plans for him?”\nShe pursed her lips, head tilting to one side. You gave me orders to keep\nmy head down.\n“I also asked you to make plans for him. Did you?” Styke insisted.\nYes.\n“I need to deal with him,” Styke said, his eyes flicking toward the door\nof their shared room where Celine was still sleeping. “But the risks…”\nKa-poel blinked at him, clearly taken aback. Risks? The gesture didn’t\nconvey sarcasm, but the crooked smile certainly did.\n“Yes, risks,” Styke said through clenched teeth. “I’m not invincible. Nor\ndo I want to be. I’ve already gotten one of my men killed, and for once in\nmy damned life I’m going to consider the consequences before I act.”\nThe smile disappeared, replaced by a thoughtful frown. I’m trying to\nsave my strength for the godstone.\n“Does it take a lot for you to control a dragonman?”\nThe bone-eye sorcery that makes them strong also protects them from\nother bone-eyes, much like the protection that I have been giving you and\nyour men. You want him to slit his own throat in the middle of the night?\nWilling him to take such a definitive action will be difficult, but not\nimpossible. It was a long series of gestures, and Styke had her repeat herself\ntwice before he’d gotten it all.\n“But will it also alert every bone-eye in the capital that one of their own\nis acting against them?” he asked.\nIt will likely alert Ka-Sedial himself.\nStyke considered the note with the words “Unity Square.” “What if I\ndon’t need anything quite so grandiose?”\nKa-poel tilted her head to one side and gestured.

        "text": "Ka-poel tilted her head to one side and gestured. What did you have in\nmind?\nStyke’s memory had been spot-on: Unity Square was a public garden not\nfar from the Etzi Household. It had flower beds, manicured lawns, stone\npathways, and even a fountain. All of it thrust out into the lake, connected\nto the rest of the city along one side by an avenue that was almost entirely\ndevoid of traffic at three o’clock in the morning.\nIt was not a good ambush spot—no high buildings, walls, or towers\nwithin crossbow range, and the only privacy was a copse of trees around the\nfountain. Bad for an ambush, good for a duel. No doubt the reason that Ji-\nPatten had chosen the place. It put to rest Styke’s worries that he was\nwalking into a trap. Ji-Patten, for all his underhanded dealing, was still a\nwarrior. Warriors had pride, especially in their fraternity. This wasn’t about\nkilling Styke for a master. This was about killing Styke for honor. Like a\ngoddamn fool.\nStyke glimpsed a figure near the fountain as he approached. There were\nno lights in the garden, but the moon was bright and Ji-Patten was\nunmistakable. His tall, muscled figure lounged casually against the\nfountain, flipping an object—one of his bone knives—up into the air and\ncatching it. Styke kept his hands out of his pockets as he approached, letting\nhis eyes search the darkest corners of the park, breathing deeply to maintain\nhis calm.\nHe reached the edge of the small grove and stopped, drawing his knife.\n“I’m surprised you came, foreigner,” Ji-Patten said, taking his own knife\nin hand and holding it casually at his side.\n“I’m surprised you’re going around your master for a fight.”\n“Who says I am?” Ji-Patten replied. Both their tones were casual, almost\nfriendly, but Styke could hear an eager tension in Ji-Patten’s voice. He\nimagined that Ji-Patten was just as ready to end this as he was—to rid\nhimself of a troublesome foreigner stirring up contention among the\npolitical elite in the city.\n“I do,” Styke said. “If your master wanted me dead, I would have woken\nup with a knife between my ribs anytime in the last ten days.”\nJi-Patten shifted slightly. A bit of nerves, maybe? “And leave Etzi with\nmore ammunition in his crusade?” he spat back. “With this, well”—he\ngestured at the empty park—“no witnesses. They won’t even find your\nbody. You’ll just… disappear.”\n“And Etzi will have a note, written in your hand and delivered by you,\ndrawing me out for a duel in the dead of the night,” Styke said. “You’re not\ndumb, dragonman. You’re just single-minded. I sympathize. I’m usually the\nsame way.”\n“The note can be dealt with,” Ji-Patten said, lifting his knife. His\nirritated tone told Styke exactly what he needed to know: This duel was, if\nnot against orders, then certainly without sanction. “Come, foreigner. We’ve\ntalked long enough.”\nStyke finally stepped into the grove, adjusting the grip on his boz knife."

We’ve\ntalked long enough.”\nStyke finally stepped into the grove, adjusting the grip on his boz knife.\nJi-Patten didn’t waste another breath. He leapt from his spot against the\nfountain, over the tangled roots of one of the trees, sprinting at full speed.\nThe movement would have been hard to follow in the daytime, and was\nhardly more than a dark blur in the moonlight. Styke didn’t bother trying to\nintercept him. He took two long steps to one side, putting a tree between\nhimself and the dragonman.\nJi-Patten’s knife hand lashed out, reaching toward Styke, just as his\nshoulder slammed into the trunk of that tree. There was a heavy grunt, the\nbranches shook, and Ji-Patten bounced away, spinning so hard that his knife\nflew out of his hand and off across the cobble path outside the grove. He\nstumbled to his feet, looking like a man who’d had four too many drinks\nand couldn’t be convinced to sleep off the booze on a pub bench.\nStyke kept his distance, watching. Ji-Patten threw both arms outward to\neither side as if maintaining a balancing act. He stared hard at Styke, and\neven in the darkness he was clearly confused. He took one step forward,\nthen a second, and fell directly on his face.\n“He’s dealt with,” Styke said loudly.\nIt took a few moments for a small figure to emerge from the shadows\nacross the avenue and reach the park. Ka-poel entered the grove at a stroll\nand paused beside Styke, looking down her nose at the dragonman. Styke\nfelt a pang of sympathy for Ji-Patten. He could think of nothing more\nterrifying for a seasoned warrior than to be helplessly manhandled by forces\nhe could not control. He remembered Markus crying over the body of his\nbrother, and stifled the sympathy.\nHe took a step to Ji-Patten, tucking one toe beneath the dragonman and\nflipping him over onto his back. He did a quick search and found the\ndragonman’s spare knife, pocketing it. He then knelt on one of Ji-Patten’s\narms and gripped him by the chin.\n“Will Ka-Sedial hear us?” he asked Ka-poel in Kez.\nShe shook her head.\n“Normally,” Styke said, switching back to Dynize and addressing Ji-\nPatten, “I would have taken you up on your offer. I love a good fight, and\nI’ve killed three of you shitheads already. But your murdering my man the\nother day reminded me about my responsibilities—and it made me realize\nthat you don’t deserve the dignity of a fair fight.”\n“What have you done to me?” Ji-Patten demanded in a harsh whisper.\nStyke jerked Ji-Patten’s head toward Ka-poel. “Wasn’t me.”\nJi-Patten’s eyes narrowed at Ka-poel for a brief moment before\nwidening. “No. The bone-eyes belong to us.”\n“Not all of them,” Styke answered.

They’re your doing, correct?”\nJi-Patten’s eyes grew wild, and he began to thrash and convulse. Styke\nleaned harder on his arm and pinned the other arm to the ground with the tip\nof his knife. The dragonman gave a pained grunt.\n“I asked you a question.”\n“Yes,” Ji-Patten hissed.\n“What else do you have planned for me and Etzi?”\nMore convulsing. Styke glanced at Ka-poel to find her staring at Ji-\nPatten with hands balled into fists, shoulders squared in determination.\nFinally, words squeezed themselves out of Ji-Patten’s lips. “I don’t know. I\nonly follow orders.”\n“And what are your orders?”\n“Stoke the mobs. Bribe and threaten Quorum members. Wait for a ship\nfrom Fatrasta.”\n“A ship?” Styke said sharply. “Carrying Orz’s condemnation?”\n“No. The Great Ka hasn’t even bothered to send it.”\n“Then what is on the ship?”\nJi-Patten had stopped struggling. He glared hard at Styke, reminding\nhim of the cavalry commander that Ka-poel had taken control of in the\nHock back in Fatrasta. “Orders.”\n“What kind of orders?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“But you suspect.”\nThe glare intensified. Styke glanced at Ka-poel again, only to find her\ndrooping. “Hey!”\nShe gestured something he could not see. He swore under his breath.\nShe was still weaker than he’d expected, and she’d put too much energy\ninto this. He leaned forward until his face was next to Ji-Patten’s ear. “For\nZak, you deserve far worse than this. But I’ll satisfy myself with ruining\neverything you and your piece-of-shit masters have built. I swear it.” He\nreversed the grip on his knife, jerked his arm up, and brought it down hard.\nIt took a few moments for the body to stop moving. When it finally had,\nhe got to his feet and crossed to Ka-poel, offering her a hand. She waved\nhim off and stumbled over to the fountain, sitting down on the stone rim. He\nsquinted to see her hands moving in the moonlight.\nThe protections around him were stronger than I thought. As was his\nwill.\n“Will you be all right?”\nI need to sleep.\n“Go. Back to the compound. I’ll take care of this.”\nKa-poel gave Styke a nod and headed back to the avenue. He waited\nuntil she was out of sight, watching for any potential witnesses to their\nconflict, before returning to Ji-Patten’s body. Despite the death of his\nenemy, he was left with a very particular disquiet. It took him a few\nmoments of consideration to pinpoint the cause of this feeling, and then a\nfew more to realize that it was twofold. The first came from the realization\nthat Ka-poel still wasn’t as strong as she should be. The second was the\nsecret that Ji-Patten had refused to divulge.\nWhat orders was he waiting for?

And when would the messenger arrive\nfrom Fatrasta? Styke could only wonder, and hope that Jackal returned soon\nwith news of Ibana.\nStyke swore under his breath again, cursing the dragonman, Sedial, and\nall the rest of the Dynize. Sedial’s faction was about to make some kind of a\nmove. Something bigger than him or Etzi. But what? He walked around the\ngrove to find the knife that had gone skidding off along the garden path. He\nplaced it with the other and returned to the body.\nKneeling down, he tapped Ji-Patten on the forehead with the tip of his\nboz knife. “You got off easy,” he said. Then he began to prepare for a long\nnight’s work.\nCHAPTER 53\nV\nlora was roused from a restless sleep by the light of a lamp and the\ngentle shaking of her shoulder. She rolled over and squinted into Buden’s\nface. He took many of the night shifts as her bodyguard because it kept him\nfrom having to relay orders and cross paths with every aid and messenger in\nthe army. Even after a decade, she couldn’t tell if he preferred solitude on\naccount of his half-missing tongue or because of shame over his noble Kez\nparentage.\n“Buden?” She tried blinking the sleep from her head. “What is it?”\n“Visor,” he muttered, the word barely understandable.\n“Who?”\n“E… E…” Buden scowled at her. “’Yni eneral.”\n“Etepali?”\nA nod.\n“Pit and damnation.” Vlora rolled to her other side and fished her pocket\nwatch out of her discarded jacket, then held it up to Buden’s lamp. It was a\nlittle past two in the morning. “What the pit is going on?”\nHe shook his head.\n“Light the lamps and give me a few minutes to dress, then send her in.”\nBuden did as instructed, leaving Vlora alone to try and summon some\nsort of clarity of thought from her sleep-addled brain. She sat on the edge of\nher cot, staring at her bare legs, wondering what the pit Etepali could\npossibly want to meet with her about at two o’clock in the morning. Was\nthis another trick from the old general? A test of Vlora’s character? The\nbeginning of a ruse? The latter concerned her the most and was what finally\ngot her moving. She made a mental checklist of everything she’d need to do\nthe moment Etepali left—recheck the pickets, send scouts to scour their\nflanks, wake the general staff.\nShe was still running through that mental checklist as she buttoned up\nher jacket when there was a knock on the main post of her tent and the tent\nflap was thrown open. The wiry old Dynize general ducked inside, followed\nby Buden’s scowl. Vlora gave Buden a small nod and he withdrew.\nVlora limped across the tent and cleaned off a chair—the same that\nDelia had sat in yesterday afternoon—and offered it to Etepali. She, in turn,"

She, in turn,\nremained standing by the tent flap with her hat in hand. She wasn’t dressed\nin her uniform, but rather a loose-fitting shirt and trousers, the style of\nwhich Vlora had seen on a few of the Dynize prisoners they’d taken\nunaware. Civilian clothing.\n“General,” she said cautiously.\nEtepali gave her a tight smile, her eyes never leaving Vlora’s face.\n“Lady Flint. Thank you for receiving me at such an hour.”\nVlora found her own chair and sat. Something was wrong here, but she\nstill wasn’t awake enough to figure out what. “Are you alone?” She looked\naround urgently to make sure her battle plans were covered, only to\nremember she’d transferred most of them to the general-staff tent just\nbefore bed.\n“I am.”\n“I see. What can I do for you, General? Drink?”\n“No, thank you.” Etepali pursed her lips and stared at her hands for a\nfew moments before finally returning her gaze to Vlora’s. “I wanted to tell\nyou something that I did not the other day.”\nVlora remained silent, gesturing for her to continue.\n“You asked about the missing Palo and the dead Kressians.”\n“I did.”\n“Yes, well. I was not honest before. I do know exactly what you’re\ntalking about.”\nVlora was fully awake now. She leaned forward with bated breath,\nwondering if she should send for Bo and Sabastenien.\nEtepali continued, “The order came not long after landing. My own\narmy, we landed off the coast about twenty miles north of Landfall, about\nthree days after what I understand your soldiers call the Battle of Windy\nRiver. Our orders were to secure our landing position and work our way up\nthe coast, controlling every port—a task that we have been about ever since.\nBut we also received a secondary order, one directly from Ka-Sedial.\nAnytime we came across a small, isolated town, we were to strip the town\nof resources, slaughter the Kressian inhabitants, and gather the Palo to be\nsent to Landfall.”\n“Only the towns?”\n“Only the towns,” Etepali confirmed. “The orders were very specific\nabout making sure that they were isolated. I was given the understanding\nthat Sedial didn’t want any witnesses left behind.”\nVlora regarded the old woman warily. “Do you have any idea why?”\n“Why for the action, or why for the witnesses?”\n“Both. Either.”\nEtepali gave a tired sigh. “Sedial does not like to tell us his why for\nanything. As you Adrans like to say, he keeps his cards close to his chest. I\nhave a few guesses. One of our propaganda points for the invasion was that\nwe were freeing the Palo—gathering our cousins back into the bosom of the\nempire. While we have vast resources, there is only so much we can ship\nover here, so Sedial is gathering labor and conscripts.”\nAs Bo had suspected. Vlora nodded.\n“As for the murder of the Kressians—I think that Sedial is making room\nfor our own immigrants. He promised land to tens of thousands of families"

He promised land to tens of thousands of families\nthat fought for him during our civil war. Clearing Kressians from the\nisolated farmsteads and villages makes room for our own people, and\neliminates any witnesses that might report such an action to the Nine.”\n“To keep us from getting involved?”\n“I suspect, yes.”\n“We’d find out eventually.”\n“Perhaps. But years from now, after we’ve fully cemented our place on\nthe continent. No one cares about atrocities decades after the fact, when\ntrade is good and the rich are getting richer.” Etepali passed a hand over her\neyes. “But this is speculation on my part. I don’t know Sedial’s mind. No\none does but his closest lieutenants.” She paused. “Regardless of the\nreasons, I ignored this order. I don’t slaughter civilians. I didn’t during our\ncivil war and I won’t now. I think the whole idea is bloodthirsty madness.\nSedial has many faults, the foremost of which is that he believes he can\ncontrol everything, that he can shape the world in his image.”\n“Hence the godstones.”\nEtepali made a sour face as if Vlora had cut to the quick of it. “Perhaps,”\nshe said evasively.\n“Why are you telling me this?”\n“Also,” Etepali said, holding up a finger, “I noticed that you’re\ncollecting keelboats. Well, if you haven’t found them already, there should\nbe well over a hundred stored up a tributary to the Hadshaw just seven\nmiles to our north.”\nSeven miles. Just outside of Vlora’s current scouting range. This felt like\na trick to her, and she instinctively pulled back from the conversation,\ntrying to see where Etepali was leading her with all of this. A hundred\nkeelboats would give her a great deal more options than she had before—\nallowing her to move almost her entire army up and down and across the\nriver at will. It made the river a highway for her and an obstacle for the\nDynize. Another edge in the upcoming battle.\n“Why are you telling me this?” she asked again, putting steel into her\nvoice. If something was going on here, she needed to get to the bottom of it.\n“You’re not turning on your allies because of some murdered civilians.”\n“I never said I was turning on my allies,” Etepali replied harshly. She\nseemed to check herself, pulling back her temper with a scowl. Vlora\nrealized this was the first time she’d seen her lose her composure. Etepali\nshook her head. “Do you remember me mentioning my cousin?”\n“Vaguely.”\n“I have a cousin named Yaret. He is a Household head—a minister with\nthe government in Fatrasta. Much younger than me, almost like a son in a\nlot of ways. Clever, thoughtful man. One of my favorite people in the\nworld.” Etepali’s face had taken on a hard, distant look. “A few hours ago, I\nreceived word of an attempted assassination.”\n“Against this Yaret?”\nShe nodded. “Many of Yaret’s Household were killed defending him.”"

Why would she\nwant to kill a random—?”\n“The assassins were Dynize,” Etepali cut her off.\nVlora sank back into her own chair, a thousand implications scrambling\nthrough her head at once. The veneer of distrust she held for Etepali was\nmarred and she found herself genuinely curious.\n“Like myself,” Etepali continued before Vlora could ask any questions,\n“Yaret fought on the other side of the civil war. We were Sedial’s enemies,\nand though we put aside our differences, we’ve still opposed him in smaller\nways politically.”\n“You think Sedial ordered the murder?”\n“I know Sedial ordered the murder. The message I received included a\nspecial note, written in invisible ink in Yaret’s own hand, that he has\nevidence that Sedial is about to begin a purge of his domestic allies.”\nEtepali was angry now, though she was hiding it well. Her nostrils flared, a\nsweat breaking out on her forehead. If this was an act, it was a very good\none. “I have believed for years that there would come a day when Sedial no\nlonger found us—his former enemies—useful. That one day he would turn\non us.”\n“And this is the day?”\n“It is. I always thought that he would rid himself of his enemies after\nusing the godstone. Not before.”\n“Have you prepared for this in any way?”\nEtepali snorted. “They’re suspicions, nothing more. I have no hard\nproof. Besides, I’m not a politician. All I could do was gather loyal soldiers.\nMy army consists entirely of allied Household members—much as Field\nMarshal Tamas consolidated his most loyal troops in Adopest before his\ncoup. Now I worry that I have brought all of Sedial’s enemies together in a\nsingle spot to make them easier to deal with.”\nVlora frowned, not entirely sure she understood the implication. It took\na few moments for realization to dawn. “You think that the other two armies\nhere are going to turn on you?”\n“I believe they have orders to that effect, yes. Both generals are from\nSedial’s inner circle. They have positioned me between their armies instead\nof to one side, which I find odd. Further, we have no instructions to actually\nattack.”\nThat healthy doubt returned to Vlora’s breast. Hadn’t Delia just told her\nthat she expected an imminent attack? “Then what are you to do?”\n“Keep you hemmed in until further orders. An odd thing to do when we\noutnumber you, isn’t it?” Etepali pressed her lips into a firm line. “I suspect\nthat, when the orders to attack do come, I will be pressed to attack first and\ntake the worst casualties. After the battle, the other two armies will turn on\nme. At least, that’s what I would do.”\nVlora scoffed in disbelief, trying to wrap her head around all of this. She\nwould have to try and confirm it, of course. But the possibility of inner\nturmoil among the Dynize could mean a change to everything! She could sit"

She could sit\nback and watch as the Dynize turned on one another, waiting to pounce at\nthe opportune moment. Her feeling of elation grew and grew until another\nrealization popped it like a lance through a boil.\n“Does Sedial act in desperation?” she asked quietly.\n“Why would he? He controls the entire southeast corner of Fatrasta.\nLindet presses him fiercely, but there is no reason to believe she can win.\nHe controls two of the godstones. His influence dictates the direction of\nboth the Dynize government and her armies.”\n“And he’s cunning?”\n“Very. I don’t use the world lightly.”\nIf all of this was true, and Sedial was about to act against his enemies…\nit meant he was in position. He had two godstones, which meant that Styke\nhad failed. Perhaps he only needed those two godstones for his plan to\nwork? She shook off the uncertainty. That didn’t matter, not right now.\nWhat mattered was that Sedial was confident enough in his position to act\nagainst his internal enemies. Time was running out.\n“What will you do?” Vlora asked.\n“The message I received from Yaret is four days old,” Etepali replied\ncarefully. “For all I know, Sedial has already finished the job. I will have to\nwait until I get further word. Not enough has happened for me to act\ndirectly.”\n“So you’ve come here to tell me what you can?”\n“Yes. I’m in a precarious position. As I said, I have no proof of Sedial’s\nintentions beyond Yaret’s communiqué. Yet I may at any moment find\nmyself at the end of an ally’s sword.” Etepali’s face hardened, her fingers\ndrawing into fists. “I am still a good Dynize citizen. But my loyalty to the\nGreat Ka, such as it was, ends with the attempt on my cousin’s life.” Etepali\nstood suddenly, shaking her head as if coming out of a dream. “There is\nanother thing.”\nVlora watched Etepali carefully. “Yes?” she urged.\n“Your politician, the Lady Snowbound.”\n“What about her?” Vlora felt her eyes narrow involuntarily.\n“She has cut some kind of a deal. I don’t know what it is, but she’s been\nsneaking a stream of messengers in and out of the camps of my fellow\ngenerals. I’ve already been instructed that if fighting begins, I am to avoid\nher provosts.”\nVlora grit her teeth, trying to decide if she could trust the old woman.\nThere was a lot of information here—juicy, inflammatory bits that could\nchange all of Vlora’s plans.\n“They are watching me, and I shouldn’t be gone so long,” Etepali said\nsuddenly. She gave Vlora a piercing glance and, in a quick rush as if to get\nit all out before she could think better of it, she said, “The last I heard,\nLandfall was protected by seventy thousand soldiers. Roughly two-thirds of\nthose are conscripts from Dynize and the Palo, and would fall beneath a\nstiff breeze. The rest are Sedial’s best soldiers. The fortress is well protected"

The fortress is well protected\nby sorcery and gun emplacements.” Her mouth snapped shut.\nVlora stood as well. Her breath was short now, her mind filled with\npossibilities and anxieties. “You know that I cannot trust you at your word.”\nEtepali gave a tired sigh. “I’m aware. We are still enemies, you and I,\nand our mutual trickery has marred the possibility of true cooperation. But\nI’m giving you this information in good faith. How you act upon it is up to\nyou. I will give you one last assurance: If I am ordered to attack, I will\ndelay doing so for as long as possible.”\n“That is… generous.”\nEtepali put on her hat and gave Vlora a small bow before sweeping out\nof the tent without another word. The moment she was gone, Vlora began to\npace, her mind on fire. After several minutes of consideration, she went to\nthe flap of the tent and told Buden to summon a messenger.\nOnce the lad arrived, Vlora barked off a storm of orders. “Double—no,\ntriple—the number of our scouts. The next few days I want to know\neverything about the Dynize. Their positioning, their maneuvers, the\nnumber of men on their front lines. If they so much as twitch in our\ndirection or toward our flanks, I want to be informed immediately. Also,\nsend an expedition up the river. There should be a tributary about seven\nmiles to the north. I want them to find any keelboats up there and bring\nthem down. Wake up Sabastenien. I want the expedition to come from his\nbest troops, and I want them gone within the hour.”\nThe messenger left at a sprint, and Vlora fell back into her chair to stew\non all of this. Of everything she had been told, one piece of information\nkept floating to the forefront of her thoughts: Delia had betrayed her. If true,\nit would not come as a surprise. But how? What kind of a deal could she\nhave cut with Ka-Sedial in such a short amount of time?\nHer body wanted nothing more than to crawl back into bed and claim a\nfew more hours of sleep, but her mind, she knew, wouldn’t allow it.\nGrabbing a lantern and lighting it, she headed out and across to the general-\nstaff tent to review her battle plans.\nShe had work to do.\nCHAPTER 54\nS\ntyke sat in the Etzi compound canteen, breaking his fast with warm\nflatbread and snake-meat kabobs while Celine and Jerio played in the\ncorner.

The other\nchildren followed faux orders seriously, gathering into a line to “assault” a\nposition on the other side of a table that they dutifully clambered over at\nCeline’s shout.\nCeline led the charge.\nStyke finished his breakfast as the kids tended to their wounded and then\nregrouped for another attack. He checked his fingernails for blood, then\nleaned back in his chair to watch the door. He had expected an outburst by\nnow—it wasn’t all that far from noon, after all—but none had come.\nAs if in answer to his thoughts, the door to the canteen opened. Etzi\nstrode in, pausing just long enough for his eyes to adjust to the lower light\nand then focusing on Styke. “Get dressed,” he said stiffly. “We’ve been\nsummoned to the Quorum Hall.” He left without saying another word.\nStyke took his time wiping crumbs from his chin and shirt and then\nclimbed slowly to his feet. This summons was not unexpected. What was\nunexpected was that it came without any extra hullabaloo. No raised alarms.\nNo rumors sweeping the city. No one in the compound acted cagey like\nthey were keeping information from him, and he hadn’t seen Etzi since\nyesterday.\nHe ambled over to the kids, getting Celine’s attention with a wave. She\nbroke off from her troops and joined him, breathless from another tumble\nover the enemy position. He touched her shoulder, frowning to himself.\n“I’m going with Etzi to the Quorum Hall.”\n“Again? I thought you were gonna try to finish the army today,” she\nsaid, referring to the cavalry unit he’d been carving.\n“Hopefully it won’t be long. I’ll work on it, promise.” He turned away,\nletting Celine return to her friends, but waited a moment to catch Jerio’s\neye. The boy approached at a slight jerk of Styke’s head.\n“Keep an eye on her,” Styke said in a low voice. “If something happens\nto me, you keep her safe. Understand?”\n“Yes, sir!” Jerio snapped a very serious salute.\nStyke watched them prepare for another charge, then headed to his room\nto don his dress uniform. He joined Etzi in the courtyard where the\nHousehold head had already climbed into a waiting carriage. Styke noted\nthat the size of Etzi’s honor guard seemed to increase with each subsequent\nvisit—there had been just a handful the day they were ambushed with Zak’s\nexecution. Now there were thirty of them on foot and another four on\nhorseback. Styke almost demanded his horse, but dismissed the notion\nwhen Etzi gestured through the door for him to climb inside.\nThey were soon rolling down the causeway that attached the compound\nto the city. Etzi sat in a glum silence for the first several minutes of the trip.\nStyke let him remain that way until he could no longer contain his own\ncuriosity.\n“Why have they summoned us?” he asked.\nEtzi’s gaze flicked to Styke’s knife, lingered there, and then moved up to\nhis face. “They found a head in the Quorum Hall this morning.”"

Etzi had made it clear\nthat he didn’t want to know more than he needed to. Styke didn’t see any\nreason to change that now.\nEtzi cleared his throat and finally averted his gaze. “The head belongs to\nJi-Patten. They haven’t been able to find the body. The Quorum Hall is\nunder guard at night, so no one has been able to explain how the head got\nthere. I’ve been at an emergency session all morning.” Etzi suddenly looked\ntired and worn. “A third of the Quorum thinks you did it. Another third\nrefuses to believe that anyone, let alone a foreign soldier on his own, could\npossibly kill a dragonman.”\n“And the other third?”\n“Divided. Foreign agents, not ruling out yourself, or infighting among\nSedial’s group, or even a mythical creature prowling the streets. We’ve kept\ninformation from leaking to the public so far, but it will happen sooner or\nlater. There is nothing more terrifying than the fear of the mob. The head\nwas found with a word written in blood on the floor—‘traitor.’ It was\nwritten in Dynize, which casts doubt on the possibility of its being a foreign\nagent.”\nStyke didn’t respond, quietly feeling pleased with himself. He’d found a\nDynize dictionary in Maetle’s library the other day and checked to make\nsure he’d spelled and conjugated the word right. Nothing like casting a little\ndoubt among one’s enemies.\nEtzi sighed. “To answer your question, I have no idea why you’re being\nsummoned. The messenger woke me up from a much-needed nap. The\nQuorum wasn’t supposed to gather again until after dinner. There’s either a\nmistake or…”\n“Or they think I murdered one of their dragonmen.”\nEtzi scowled. “It must be a mistake. If you’re being arrested, they would\nhave shown up at my compound with several of his comrades.”\nThey fell into an uncomfortable silence for the rest of the trip, arriving\noutside the Quorum Hall, where Etzi and Styke disembarked. Styke\nadjusted his overly warm jacket, tugging at the collar as he looked around\nthe square. The crowd was thinner than usual, and he wondered if perhaps\nthe rumors of Ji-Patten’s discovered head had already begun to send the\npopulace into a fear spiral—certainly not something he’d intended, but it\ncould be a useful side effect.\nHe followed Etzi down the long hall, and they soon entered the Quorum\nHall, only to find it practically empty. A handful of janitors cleaned the\ntiered seating, while small pockets of Household heads and representatives\nspoke in hushed tones. No one paid any mind to Etzi and Styke’s entrance.\n“I thought you said the Quorum summoned us?” Styke said.\n“I did,” Etzi replied, a look of confusion crossing his face. “Stay here.”"

He pursed his lips, looking\nacross to the few other occupants of the room, an uneasy feeling growing in\nhis gut. His mind immediately leapt to suspicion. Had they been lured out\nof the compound for some reason? Were Sedial’s people making some kind\nof play? Or was he just being paranoid?\nEtzi returned a few moments later, shaking his head. “I just spoke with\nthe Quorum clerk. He didn’t send out a summons.”\n“Could this be a ruse?”\n“To what end?”\n“To get us out of the compound.” Styke felt his shoulders tense. Celine.\n“We have to go back.” He was already moving by the time he finished the\nwords, half jogging out of the Hall. Etzi was close on his heels, and they\nreached the carriage and honor guard a moment later. “Back to the\ncompound,” Etzi barked. “And quickly!”\nStyke settled in across from Etzi as the carriage began to jolt along the\ncobbles. He was a bundle of nerves now, his hand resting on his knife, the\nother clenched in a fist. A decent portion of Etzi’s Household guard was\nwith them right now, leaving the compound with just the men and women\nwho worked there during the day. It was practically defenseless. He could\nfeel a growing desperation and resisted the urge to shout out the window at\nthe driver. He should have ridden Amrec, damn it.\nThe carriage turned a corner and suddenly lurched to a stop, nearly\nthrowing Etzi on top of Styke. The lurch was accompanied by the swearing\nof the driver and several exclamations from the soldiers jogging alongside.\n“Sir,” a voice said, “we have a problem.”\nEtzi climbed out, and from Styke’s viewpoint he could see the\nHousehold head pale visibly. He followed him into the street.\nTheir path had been blocked—the road cordoned off with carts, barrels,\nand any other large detritus that came readily to hand. This bit of road\nwasn’t exactly an alley, but it wasn’t an avenue, either—a rather narrow\nbend in the road with poor visibility and, more importantly, not nearly\nenough room to turn a carriage around. Crowded into the blockade was a\nmob of at least fifty men and women armed with clubs, torches, and\nmachetes. They stared at Etzi’s carriage in eerie silence.\n“What is this?” Etzi demanded. “Move them aside!”\nSeveral members of his guard blanched. The four on horseback rode\nforward hesitantly, and the captain of the guard demanded to speak with\nwhoever was in charge of the barricade.

Styke snatched him by the\narm, giving him a shake.\n“Sir,” the captain of the guard called. “They want the foreigner.”\nStyke growled under his breath, turning back to the barricade. More\npeople poured out of nearby buildings to join the mob, swelling the\nnumbers. There were few guns among them, but he did see a handful of\nmusket barrels poking out of windows above the street. His gut twisted.\nThis was it, then. Styke’s punishment for the murder of Ji-Patten. It had\ncertainly been organized quickly enough.\nEtzi seemed to shake himself from his panic. “Tell them that I am a\nHousehold head and to disperse immediately!” he called angrily. “This\ndamned rabble can terrorize the citizenry, but I am a member of the\nHousehold Quorum!” He was shouting now, at the mob itself rather than at\nhis guard captain.\nStyke took a firm grip of Etzi’s arm. “This isn’t a mob,” he warned.\n“Look at them. No shouting. No incoherence. I’ve faced mobs, and they’re\nnot this organized. They’re cutting us off from behind. It’s a trap set by\nSedial’s people.” This wasn’t law or politics. They were out of Etzi’s realm\nnow, and that moment of panic in the Household head had shown Styke\nwhat kind of mettle he was dealing with.\nEtzi would have no choice but to hand him over, and Styke struggled not\nto blame him for that. No time for blame. He mentally tracked his own path\nthrough the mob, finding where it was thinnest. He spotted a door that\nwould take him into one of the nearby buildings. Once inside, he’d either\nhold out against the rabble or find a rear exit. After that, he’d have to make\nhis way to Etzi’s compound to fetch Amrec, Ka-poel, and Celine.\n“Give us the foreigner, or face the consequences!” someone shouted.\nEtzi’s guards looked to him for orders. Styke watched, tensed, for that look\nof defeat in Etzi’s eyes and prepared to draw his knife and charge the\nrabble.\n“Consequences?” Etzi suddenly roared, catching Styke off guard. “You\nspeak of consequences! Your blood is on your own hands, you ingrates! To\nme, my soldiers, to me! Fix bayonets! Hurien, hold our withdrawal! Kepuli,\nabandon the carriage and lead us back the way we came. Cut down anyone\nwho gets in our way!”\nStyke suddenly found himself swept into the center of the guard, shoved\nshoulder-to-shoulder with Etzi. The group marched in lockstep back around\nthe corner, fixing bayonets as they moved while a small portion of Etzi’s\nguard leveled their weapons at the mob now behind them. Someone in the\nrabble gave a shout, and the muskets above them opened fire. One of Etzi’s\nguards fell, and the rest shot blindly into the mob."

One of Etzi’s\nguards fell, and the rest shot blindly into the mob.\nStyke lost sight of their rearguard as he and Etzi rounded the corner and\napproached the half-finished barricade going up to block their retreat. The\nguard lowered their bayonets as one and charged with a shout. They hit hard\nand fast, and it became clear that whoever had organized this rabble had\nunderestimated Etzi’s ability to think on his feet. The mob dissolved\nbeneath the points of their bayonets, fleeing for the main avenue or nearby\nalleys. Less than half of them stood their ground.\nStyke drew his knife, only for Etzi to snatch him by the forearm. “No!”\nEtzi snapped. “This blood is for us to spill—I don’t want a single knife\nwound on any of Sedial’s stooges.”\nReluctantly, Styke returned his knife to its sheath.\nThe fight between Etzi’s guard and roughly twice their number in armed\ncommoners was short and bloody. Those who hadn’t fled the initial charge\nwere enthusiastic, but they had no chance against a wall of bayonets from a\ngroup of guardsmen who, Etzi had once told him, were mostly veterans of\nthe civil war. Once the mob was dead, wounded, or scattered and the\nbarricade claimed, Etzi began to bark orders.\n“You, get the city guard! Kepuli, give Ben and me four men to get back\nto the compound. Use the rest to relieve our friends.”\n“Just four, sir?”\n“I said four, didn’t I? We’ll take the main avenues, where they’ll be loath\nto confront us. Now, go!”\nStyke watched the guard captain gather his forces and head back around\nthat corner. His adrenaline was up, his fury at the ambush just now\nfollowing on the heels of unfulfilled bloodlust. He reluctantly followed Etzi\nand his four guards back to the main avenue, where they headed toward the\ncompound using a long, very public route.\nAt one point he saw a column of city guards rushing toward the scene of\nthe ambush. None of them seemed to even notice Etzi and Styke. The rest\nof the way back was uneventful, and they were soon inside the compound,\nwhere Etzi ordered the last of his guards to man the wall.\nStyke found Celine still playing with Jerio and the others in the canteen.\nHe looked in on her, resisting the urge to go give her a hug, and quietly\nbacked out.\nIt did not take him long to pinpoint the fear he had felt during that\nambush—the fear, not for his life, but that Celine would be left without his\nprotection in a strange land. His heart was still hammering when Etzi’s\nHousehold guard returned almost an hour later. They shouted for Maetle to\nattend the wounded, and they were carrying half a dozen covered litters\nbetween them—the dead from the ambush.

Styke skirted the courtyard and\ncame around from behind to join the Household head. Etzi blinked at Styke,\nthen looked back at the dead and wounded. His expression was distant,\nshell-shocked. It seemed to take him a few moments to realize that Styke\nwas even there. Then his expression hardened. “Did you kill Ji-Patten?”\n“Do you really want to know?”\n“Yes.”\n“Hold on,” Styke said, returning to his room. He fetched one of Ji-\nPatten’s knives and returned to Etzi in the corridor. “I was going to give it\nto Orz. A memento as to how your mother has been avenged.”\nEtzi took the knife in both hands, rotating it with his fingers, his gaze\nlingering on the bone-white blade. “How did he die?”\n“Like a dog. Ka-poel ambushed him, and I finished him off.”\n“She broke a dragonman?”\n“Yes.”\nEtzi took a few deep breaths, then put the bone knife in his pocket.\n“Good. He didn’t deserve a better death.”\n“That’s how I saw it.”\nEtzi looked up at Styke sharply. “This”—he thrust a hand toward the\ncourtyard—“is an escalation. I cannot say whether it was planned before Ji-\nPatten’s murder or in direct response to it, but that does not matter. Sedial’s\nstooges have attacked a Household head. He has overplayed his hand, and I\nwill make certain that he feels the consequences.”\nStyke felt, not for the first time, that things were spiraling well beyond\nhis control. But this time he also felt that they might very quickly get\nbeyond Etzi’s, Sedial’s, or anyone else’s control as well. Now, more than\never, he needed the Mad Lancers behind him. He silently urged Jackal to\nreturn with word of Ibana. “I appreciate you not handing me to the mob.”\nHe meant it. No need to puff up pleasantries to please his host. Etzi had\nlikely saved his life, at the cost of many of his own guards.\n“Do not thank me,” Etzi answered angrily. “I am doing my duty toward\nmy Household and my guest. That they thought I would hand you over\nwithout a fight isn’t just folly on their part—it is an insult against me. I only\nhave one regret.”\n“What’s that?”\nEtzi wiped a hand across his brow, gaze lingering on the wounded\nscattered across the courtyard. “That this feels like the first step toward\nmore violence—and that we are at the center of it.”\nCHAPTER 55\nM\nichel squatted in the offshoot of a tunnel in the Landfall catacombs,\nwatching the bobbing of lights pass just below him as hundreds of Yaret’s\nHousehold members streamed by.

Michel checked his pocket watch by the light of his\nown lantern. It was almost four o’clock in the morning.\nIt had taken them four whole days to plan the exodus—two for Michel\nto verify Tenik’s story and lay the groundwork for moving several hundred\npeople into the tunnels, and another two days for Yaret to gather supplies,\ncall in ranking Household members from the nearby army camps, and\nprepare his cupbearers for the job. As far as Michel knew, the whole thing\nhad been airtight. Most of the Household didn’t even know they were\nrunning for it until they were awakened from their beds and told to descend\ninto the catacombs.\nStill, he couldn’t help the pervasive worry that something was going to\ngo wrong. All it took was one spy to tip off Sedial to the flight. Michel\nscuffed the floor with the toe of his boot, trying to wrench his thoughts\naway from worry.\n“I don’t think anyone recognized you,” he told Ichtracia.\nShe stood beside him, watching the political refugees with something\nbetween bemusement and irritation. “Nobody is even glancing this\ndirection,” she answered. “I’m not going to hang around long enough for\nthem to start wondering. Besides, you said that one of Yaret’s soldiers\nrecognized me back at the park.”\n“He’s been sworn to secrecy,” Michel promised. “Only three people in\nthe Household know you’re in Landfall.”\n“Three too many,” Ichtracia muttered, shaking her head. “Too late now, I\nsuppose. How are you going to feed all these people?”\n“I’m wondering the same thing.” The words might as well have been\nMichel’s, but they came from behind him. He stood up, nodding to Jiniel as\nshe came up to stand between him and Ichtracia. “You’re insane,” she told\nhim.\n“I’m saving hundreds of people from the knife of a tyrant,” he replied.\n“With resources that could be used by Palo.” The tone wasn’t\nargumentative, but it did contain a light rebuke. Jiniel didn’t agree with his\ndecision, but they’d hashed out the plan over the last couple of days and\ndecided that the benefits outweighed the costs. She seemed to realize whom\nshe was standing beside and ducked her head at Ichtracia. “Sorry.”\n“Don’t apologize to me. Yaret is no friend of mine.”\nMichel held up a hand to forestall further discussion as two figures\npulled themselves away from the passing group and headed up the tunnel\ntoward them. Michel picked up his lantern, holding it above his head until\nhe could see that it was just Yaret and Tenik. They nodded to him solemnly,\ngave Ichtracia a wary glance, and looked curiously at Jiniel.\n“This is a friend of mine,” Michel said, gesturing to her. “The fewer\nnames you know, the safer this whole process will be.”\n“For you,” Tenik said. His expression was surly, his eyes red.\nMichel gave him a worried glance. “Yes, for us.”\nYaret waved away his cupbearer’s concern. “What Tenik means to say,”"

You’re saving a lot of people\ntonight.”\n“At least for now,” Ichtracia reminded him. “Eventually, Sedial is going\nto figure out where you went and come looking for you.”\n“Yes, but this gives us a head start on him.” Yaret sounded tired, but\npositive. “It gives us time to figure out how to get out of the city to unite\nwith Etepali.”\nMichel squeezed Tenik’s shoulder. “I’ll do what I can on that front.\nSmuggling so many people out of Landfall is going to be a measure more\ndifficult than having you all walk into a tunnel. But with this chaos, you\nmight just be able to do so.”\nTenik cast a dark look at his master. “They tried again tonight.”\n“Tried what?” There was a note of despair in Tenik’s voice that worried\nMichel.\n“Another assassin,” Tenik said. “A lone dragonman. Killed two of our\ncupbearers. Seventeen of our soldiers. I…” He fell silent, squeezing his\neyes shut.\nMichel made a silent “ah” with his mouth. No wonder Tenik was in a\ndark mood.\n“One of the men who died protecting me,” Yaret said quietly, “was his\ncousin. They were very close.” Michel thought he saw a trace of guilt cross\nYaret’s face, but he couldn’t have been sure in the lantern light. Yaret\ncleared his throat. “I have some information that you might find useful. As a\nway of thanking you.”\n“Anything you can give us,” Jiniel said.\nYaret produced a bundle from his jacket and handed it to her. “We\nintercepted a number of dispatches just a few hours ago. They should have\ncome to us, but they were sent to another Household. According to the\ndispatches, Lindet is giving Sedial’s forces a pit of a time. She’s pushed to\nwithin thirty miles of Landfall, but she’s strung herself out. Our generals are\nstill confident they can win, but have asked Sedial for more troops. Lindet\nis a more capable commander than anyone expected.”\n“That sounds about right,” Michel said. Lindet’s approach was a mixed\nblessing, depending on how he looked at it. She wasn’t an ally, not by a\nlong shot, but she was keeping Sedial very distracted right now.\n“The problem is,” Yaret went on, “most of the troops out fighting her\nbelong to the Households on the purge list. Sedial is throwing them to the\nwolves and keeping his most loyal close to him. I’ve sent word to anyone\naffiliated with my Household to withdraw, and I know I’m not the only\nHousehold head to do so.”\n“Let’s hope some of yours are able to get out of that quagmire,” Jiniel\nsaid. To Michel’s surprise, she sounded sincere. But then again, she’d\nalways had a good grasp of nuance—knowing how to find allies among her\nenemies and when to forgive the latter.

Lindet had always been good at making promises. Making\nher keep them was the difficult part.\n“Any word on the violence in the city?” Michel asked, directing the\nquestion at both Jiniel and Yaret.\n“Nothing on our end since nightfall,” Jiniel said. “There was a riot in\nProctor, but it burned itself out before it could get too dangerous.”\nTenik spoke up. “Sedial is planning some kind of reprisal. We’ve been\ncut out of a lot of communication since that first assassination attempt, but\nwe do know that he’s sending some of his best soldiers into the city.”\n“That’s not something I wanted to hear,” Michel said, swearing softly.\n“A show of force,” Yaret said. “Constant patrols, tightened curfews.” He\nrubbed his shoulders. “I’m worried what this means. Sedial doesn’t usually\nescalate until he’s ready to act.”\n“He’s close,” Ichtracia said, a sneer on her lips. “He’s got the blood he\nneeded to unlock the godstone. He has control of two of them. He might try\nto create a god with the power at his fingertips.”\n“Will that work?” Yaret asked with a shudder. “I thought he needed the\nthird.”\n“Maybe.” Ichtracia shifted from one leg to the other nervously. She\nlooked angry and uncertain. “Maybe not.”\nA thought danced at the back of Michel’s mind—something that had\nbeen floating around his head ever since he first met Sedial. “Are we still\npretending that Sedial isn’t just going to seize godhood for himself?” Tenik,\nYaret, and Ichtracia all turned to Michel as if he’d just uttered the worst\nkind of blasphemy, staring at him with disbelief. He cautiously went on. “I\ndon’t know how it works, to be fair. But from what I understand, this new\ngod doesn’t just come out of nowhere. It’s an ascension of sorts, for an\nactual person.”\n“It’ll be the emperor,” Yaret said confidently. “That was always the plan.\nOur emperor will become god, and have the power to hold us together…”\nHe trailed off, looking at his two fellow Dynize. Tenik seemed even more\nglum than before. Ichtracia’s disbelief slowly turned to horror.\n“He’s right,” she breathed. “Pit, why did none of us see this before?”\n“No,” Yaret scoffed. “Not even Sedial would commit such a crime. He\nwants power, but to take the strength of the godstones for himself would\nbe… I can’t even think of a word for it!” He rounded on Ichtracia. “You\nreally think he’s capable of such a thing?”\nShe gave a reluctant nod. “He wants order. It’s his greatest desire. What\nbetter way to do it than with the power of a god?” Her face screwed up, and\nfor a moment Michel thought she might vomit. “I agree with Michel. It’s\nsomething he would do.”\nYaret swore softly. Michel could see his thoughts moving quickly, his\nexpression hardening with resolve. “I see. Tenik, I want you to send runners"

Tenik, I want you to send runners\nto our closest allies. Tell them we think that Sedial is planning on seizing\nthe god gift for himself.”\n“We don’t have any proof,” Tenik replied.\n“It doesn’t matter. Did you see my face? If it looked anything like yours,\nit shows how mindless we’ve become.” He swore again. “None of us even\nconsidered the possibility, but once Michel spoke it aloud, it took very little\nto convince us of the truth of it. We know what kind of a man Sedial is.\nWe’ve just denied it to ourselves. Go!”\nTenik gave Yaret a half bow and limped down the tunnel. Yaret slapped a\nfist against the wall and looked at Michel. The positive veneer that he’d\nworn a few minutes ago was gone and there was a deep sorrow in his eyes.\n“What ruin have I led my Household to?”\n“No ruin yet,” Michel said, hoping that he sounded reassuring.\n“Even if we escape… we can’t fight against a god.”\n“He has to get that godhood first,” Ichtracia said, her lip curled.\n“Who can stop him?” Yaret swayed slightly and waved off an offered\nhand. “I must see to my people. Thank you again, Michel. I would not have\nexpected such a kindness from an ally, let alone…”\n“A traitor?” Michel asked.\nYaret snorted. “That word will never be used to describe you again. Not\nin my Household. As far as I’m concerned, you are still Devin-Michel, a\nYaret—if that title means anything when the week is through.” He nodded\nagain and headed down the tunnel.\nMichel watched him go, worried. His suggestion that Sedial would seize\nthe power of the godstones for himself had been halfway to a joke—he had\nassumed everyone thought the same thing. He hadn’t expected it to have\nsuch a demoralizing effect on Yaret and Tenik. “Jiniel, can you set someone\naside to make sure we help them as much as possible?”\nJiniel side-eyed Ichtracia. “We’re stretched thin, Michel.”\n“Just one person. A liaison. Yaret may still be of use to us.”\n“What did you always tell me about being sentimental toward your\nformer targets?” That rebuke was back in her tone again. Ichtracia made an\nirritable grunt, and Michel put up a hand to forestall a fight.\n“You’re not wrong. But… I have to do this.”\nJiniel seemed on the edge of objecting, but finally gave a nod. “I’ll\nprovide a liaison.”\n“Thanks, I—”\nMichel was cut off by someone shouting his name farther down the\ntunnel. He turned to see a lantern rushing toward him, and the figure\nholding it resolved into Tenik. The cupbearer held his leg, limping quickly\nwith a grimace of pain. “Michel!”\n“I’m here! What is it?”\n“One of my people just now reported in from the capital building. We\nsent him there to recover some of the Blackhat files, and he overheard a\nmeeting of a few of Sedial’s lieutenants.” Tenik looked over his shoulder,"

He’s sent three Privileged to put\nGreenfire Depths to the flame. He intends to destroy it completely, and\neveryone in it.”\nMichel felt like he’d been punched. “That’s a hundred thousand people.\nMore. He’s just going to snuff them out? Damn it all! When?”\n“Just after dawn.”\nMichel spun to Jiniel. “Sound the alarm. Get a hold of everyone you\ncan. We need to evacuate the Depths!”\n“Evacuate?” Jiniel hissed. “That would take days. Weeks!”\n“You have just a few hours.”\n“We can at least get our people out. Come on!” Jiniel grabbed Michel by\nthe hand and began to pull him down the tunnel. He escaped her grasp and\nturned to Ichtracia.\n“You should stay here.” The last word hadn’t left his mouth when he\nfinally caught sight of her face, shadows flickering in the lantern light. It\nwas a mask of fury.\n“No,” she spat, striding past him.\n“Wait!”\nShe didn’t stop. “You are good at picking your fights, Michel. I’m\npicking mine. I won’t let him do this. Not to all those people. They think the\nPalo don’t have a Privileged. But you do. You have me.”\nMichel exchanged a glance with Tenik, then nodded to Jiniel. “Get our\npeople out. Send runners to every Palo leader we know. Everyone who can’t\nflee should be prepared to fight for their lives. We have to try to save who\nwe can.” He began to run.\n“Where are you going?” she shouted after him.\n“With Ichtracia. We’re going to buy you as much time as we can!”\nCHAPTER 56\nI\nt took Vlora’s scouts an entire day to locate and retrieve the keelboats that\nEtepali had told her would be hidden up the river.

Besides, I wanted you to get your heads right\nbefore he shows up.”\nNila harrumphed. Bo looked down at his dressing gown. “I should have\nput on pants.” He gestured at one of Vlora’s messengers waiting just up the\nbank. “Hey, you. Yes, you. Go get me some pants!”\n“And one of my dresses, dear,” Nila said.\n“And a dress!” Bo added. “Just ask for Javinia. She’ll pick out the right\nones.” He sighed and produced his enormous pipe from the pocket of his\ndressing gown, puffing it to life. They were soon wreathed in a cloud of\ncherry-scented tobacco. Vlora waved a little away from her face and\nchecked her pocket watch again, hoping that Prime would be early. She had\na lot to do today.\n“It’s not enough,” she muttered under her breath, counting the keelboats\nas they went by.\n“What’s not enough?” Bo asked.\nShe didn’t answer, content to continue counting. She could feel him\nwatching her and wondered if he’d already guessed her plan. As if to\nanswer her question, he suddenly gave a soft “ah-ha!”\n“Yes?” she asked.\n“We’re not going to fight them, are we?”\nVlora put a hand to her ear, feeling a momentary urge to play coy. “Isn’t\nthat fighting you hear?”\n“No,” Bo said slowly. “That is a cavalry screen.” The report of artillery\npunctuated his statement. “And a bit of field gunnery to muddy the waters.”\nHe pointed to the empty river just to their south, where his sorcery had\nthrown up a simple, but effective, screen of mist that hid her mass of\nkeelboats. “I thought that you were going to get all clever with the\nkeelboats—use them to ferry men back and forth across the river so that we\ncan use the river to our advantage while the Dynize cannot.”\n“That was my plan, yes,” Vlora responded.\n“But we’re not going to do that anymore, are we? We’re going right for\nthe big prize: Landfall. What, exactly, did Etepali say to you when she\nvisited the other day?”\n“She said she’s worried about getting stabbed in the back. They have no\norders to attack us, and if they do get any, she’s going to hold back as long\nas possible.”\n“Shouldn’t we take advantage of her doubt in order to attack her two\nallies?”\n“Fighting a foe with a two-to-one numerical advantage against us still\nisn’t something I’d rush into,” Vlora said. “But I’m also worried that they\ndon’t need to attack us. If Sedial is simply buying time so he can make his\nmove…”\n“Even without the third godstone?”"

He thumbed a little more\ntobacco into his pipe and donned a nasty little smile. “That’s going to be\nvery dangerous.”\n“And there is no possible way Sedial will expect it. Have you been\nkeeping a closer eye on Delia?”\n“Of course. She’s just going about her business, though. No evidence\nthat she’s betrayed us. Ah! Speaking of which…” Bo trailed off due to the\nsudden arrival of Delia Snowbound. The politician and her retinue crested a\nnearby hill and strode toward Vlora with purpose. “She doesn’t look\nhappy,” Bo muttered under his breath.\nVlora tried a welcoming smile, but it felt like a grimace on her lips so\nshe exchanged it for a neutral expression. “Good morning, Lady\nSnowbound. I trust you slept well?”\nDelia thrust a finger at Vlora and began to talk even before she’d closed\nthe distance between them. “What the pit are you up to?” she demanded.\n“I’ve just been informed that none of my messengers are allowed into or out\nof the camp.”\n“They’re not,” Vlora confirmed.\n“Did we not have an understanding? Aren’t I trying to end this war?”\n“We do have an understanding,” Vlora replied coolly. “That\nunderstanding is that I am still very much in charge of the army. We are at a\ncritical moment, and I’ve suspended passes for nonvital personnel.”\n“You cannot!”\n“I can, and I did.” Vlora swallowed her annoyance and tried a different\ntactic. She still wasn’t entirely certain that Delia had betrayed them. She\nneeded to be careful. “This isn’t personal, Delia. I’m undertaking a bit of\nvery delicate maneuvering. That fighting you hear? Our entire cavalry force\nis out there providing a skirmisher’s screen so that I can move my troops\naround with impunity. I don’t want any of your messengers coming or\ngoing, because if they were to be questioned about my movements, it may\nruin my entire strategy.”\nThe reasonable tone seemed to have an effect on Delia. Her posture\nrelaxed slightly and she sniffed at Bo and Nila’s dressing gowns. “I thought\nyou told me you weren’t going to attack them.”\n“Not a real attack. Just a screening maneuver.”\n“And how long will this last?”\n“Just the next thirty-six hours,” Vlora said reassuringly.\n“I see.” Delia regarded Vlora with a cold look. “Are you going to tell me\nwhat those maneuvers are?”\n“I’m not. As I said, they’re very delicate. Very secret.” Vlora spread her\nhands. “You’re welcome to take it up with the general staff, but most of\nthem are in the dark as well.

But here\nshe was.\n“That was bullshit, wasn’t it?” Bo asked.\n“Of course not.”\n“The general staff doesn’t know we’re making a run for Landfall?”\n“Oh, they know. I told them about forty minutes ago. But they also know\nthat it depends on us getting about fifty more keelboats. If we can’t get the\nkeelboats, then we’re going to go to the second plan.”\n“Which is?”\n“Break these two field armies right here and now, and then march to\nLandfall. Ah, here’s Prime.” She caught sight of the Predeii walking along\nthe opposite bank, coming up from the keelboat where they’d secured the\ngodstone. She headed toward the bridge and was followed by Bo and Nila.\nThey met the old man halfway across, where he raised a hand in greeting\nand studiously avoided making eye contact with Nila.\n“Good morning, Lady Flint. Borbador. Nila.”\n“Morning, Prime. So what is this damned thing that we captured? Was it\nworth the effort?”\nPrime ran his fingers along the birthmark that crossed his face and scalp.\n“Yes, yes I do believe it was. And as I suspected, it is not a pedestal. Come\nwith me.”\nThe small group followed him back across the opposite bank and\nboarded the keelboat, where Prime brought their attention to a number of\nsymbols chiseled into the stone. They were little more than gobbledygook\nto Vlora, but Nila and Bo just frowned. “I thought we agreed those are\nmeaningless?” Bo said.\n“We did!” Prime said excitedly. “But an old memory floated through my\nhead last night, and I cross-referenced these symbols with a book I have\noutlining some of the very earliest known samples of Old Deliv. They\nmatch. At least, once you turn them upside down they do.”\n“And?” Vlora asked.\n“And these symbols are a simple instruction. It translates very literally\nas ‘Put the blood here.’” He pointed to the side of the stone, where there\nwas a slight depression beneath the words. Or rather, Vlora realized,\ncraning her head, just above the words. “Wait, are we looking at this thing\nsideways?”\n“Sideways and upside down,” Prime declared. He slapped the stone.\n“This is actually the top.”\n“‘Put the blood here,’” Vlora mused. “I assume that’s a sacrificial\nthing?”\n“See this?” Prime said, hurrying around and climbing up a ladder until\nhe was on the top of the stone. Vlora followed him. He pointed to a ridge,\nthen produced a piece of paper. “This is a sketch I made of the godstone\nbefore we destroyed it. Once I realized that we were looking at the top\nrather than the side, and now we’re standing on the side rather than the top,"

Once I realized that we were looking at the top\nrather than the side, and now we’re standing on the side rather than the top,\nI surmised that this ridge fits against the base of the godstone. Like a puzzle\npiece.”\nVlora looked down at Bo and Nila, who were still staring at the symbols.\n“Are you following any of this?”\nNila and Bo glanced at each other. Nila pointed to one of the symbols\nand said something in a low voice to Bo. He shook his head. She said\nsomething else, and he grimaced, then slowly nodded. Nila looked up at\nPrime. “You think it’s an altar?”\n“For blood sacrifices, yes,” Prime replied matter-of-factly. “I believe\nthat it is a sort of key to the godstone. The lines match up too well for it not\nto be. Slide it up against the base of the godstone, connect it via sorcery,\nthen apply the required blood and…” He gestured expansively.\n“You could have told me this before I climbed on the thing.” Vlora had a\nsudden, powerful urge to bathe. She climbed down and headed to the\nriverbank, where she waited for her friends to join her. “So we know what it\nis. What do we do with it?”\n“Destroy it, preferably,” Prime said.\n“What little blasting oil we have left we’re saving for the godstone in\nLandfall.”\nPrime wrinkled his nose. “No doubt, they have uncovered a similar altar\nfor the other godstone.”\n“We’ll deal with that when we get to it.” Vlora gazed at the thing,\nfeeling deeply unsettled. An altar for blood sacrifices. She had no illusions\nabout how the bone-eyes got their power, but an altar of this size seemed\ncreated for more than the occasional bit of blood. She could only imagine\nhow many throats had been slit over this thing. “All right. We take it with us\nto Landfall. Once we rendezvous with the fleet, we put it on a ship and take\nit out to sea, where we dump it someplace deep.”\n“Isn’t it dangerous to take it toward its original destination?” Prime\nasked.\n“We’re cut off from the coast by three field armies,” Vlora replied flatly.\n“Do you have any better ideas?”\n“I don’t.”\n“The good news,” Bo pointed out, “is that for Sedial to capture the damn\nthing he’ll have to kill us all.”\n“That’s not good news, dear,” Nila said gently.\n“It just means we won’t have to deal with whatever god he creates.”\nVlora rubbed her temples. “Yes, I suppose that’s a silver lining.” She\nlooked up, taken aback by a sudden cheer around the bend of the river. The\ncheer carried on for several moments, then grew quiet. She could hear a\nruckus in that direction and shook her head. “Any idea what’s going on\ndown there?” she asked.\n“Beats me,” Bo replied. “It’s on the other side of our keelboat fleet.”\nVlora walked back to the bridge and crossed to the riverbank and the\nedge of camp.

She had half a\nmind to go find the source of it, but the sounds of gunshots from her cavalry\nscreen seemed more worthy of her attention. She needed to check in with\nher officers and with the artillery—make sure everything was going\nsmoothly. “Go put some pants on, and find out what everyone’s cheering\nabout,” she tossed over her shoulder at Bo, heading up the side of the bank.\nShe hadn’t reached the top of the hill when the gallop of hooves caught\nher attention. It was Davd, and his face was flushed. He sawed at the reins,\ncalming his horse, and breathlessly saluted.\n“What’s going on?” Vlora asked.\nDavd grinned down at her. “They’re back!”\n“Who’s back?”\n“The soldiers we left after Windy River. Vallencian and all the\nwounded.”\nVlora waved at the news, pleased. That would be several hundred\nrecovered veterans. She hadn’t enjoyed leaving them behind, and rescuing\nthem from the Fatrastans had been one of the things she’d worried about\naccomplishing before leaving the continent. “Good, good. Send the Ice\nBaron to see me when he gets the chance.” She turned to go. “Wait, how did\nthey find us?”\nDavd’s grin grew wider. “That’s not all, ma’am. Colonel Olem is with\nthem.”\nVlora stood back, watching as dozens of keelboats poled up to the bank of\nthe Hadshaw and began to disgorge the soldiers she had left in the care of\nthe Ice Baron after the Battle of Windy River. The group included both\nwounded and recovered, and it appeared that they had brought with them\nfar more supplies than they had when they had left. The mercenaries in their\ncrimson uniforms embraced their regular-army brethren, the two groups\nintermingling happily. Spontaneous “huzzahs” broke out among reunited\nsquads.\nVallencian stood out among the group, rushing back and forth, trying to\nkeep everyone organized as they spilled off the keelboats. He was largely\nignored. He finally threw his hands up in distress and looked around, his\nface lighting up when he spotted Vlora. She braced herself as he rushed up\nthe hillside toward her.\n“Lady Flint!” he bellowed.\n“Vallencian,” she replied, offering her hand. She tried not to be rude to\nthe man who had cared for her wounded for the last few months, but she\nalso looked around him, trying to pick Olem out of all the faces on the\nriverbank. It was so much harder without her sorcery. “Wait, don’t…”\nVallencian barely slowed as he barreled toward her, pulling her into a hug\nthat lifted her clear off the ground. She bit her lip against the pain, forcing a\ngrin onto her face, and gently patted him on the arm.\nHe set her down but kept his hands on her shoulders, holding her at\narm’s length like a parent seeing their child after a year away at school.\n“You are well?”\n“Mending, yes.”\n“You’ve looked better, I’ll admit.”\n“It was worse two months ago.” For some reason, his concerned\nbluntness brought a smile to her lips."

You’re stronger, wiser.” He slapped her on\nthe shoulder, nearly knocking her off her feet. “I look forward to hearing the\nstories. Once we’ve kicked the Dynize out of Landfall, I insist that you stay\nat my home outside the city. We’ll have food, drink, dancers. The finest of\neverything!” He gestured expansively, nearly smacking Vlora in the face.\nShe leaned back.\n“I’m not sure we’ll be staying long enough for that. Besides, the last\ntime I visited one of your houses, you didn’t have any furniture.”\nVallencian seemed to consider this. “I’ll get some. For you.”\n“If I’m still in the city,” Vlora promised.\n“Good. Good! Now, I haven’t had a drop of good whiskey in three days.\nWhere can I find something to drink?”\nVlora opened her mouth to direct him toward the quartermaster with her\nblessings, only to find the words snatched from her tongue as her eyes fell\non Olem. He’d appeared behind Vallencian as if by magic, and stood quietly\nwith his hands clasped behind his back. Vlora stared at him, a rush of\nemotions tearing through her faster than she could understand them. Relief\nturned into guilt, which turned into anxiety, and then back again into relief.\nShe studied his face. His hair was a little longer, his beard grown out. He\nwasn’t wearing his uniform. His face was placid.\n“Vallencian,” she said quickly, “let me introduce you to Magus\nBorbador and Privileged Nila.” Vlora spun toward Bo, who was\napproaching them as he buttoned up his jacket. “Borbador,” she called, “this\nis my dear friend the Ice Baron. Make friends.” She practically shoved\nVallencian toward Bo and then spun back around to face Olem.\nThey watched each other from a half dozen paces apart. Vlora fought\nwith the confusing jumble of emotions wrestling one another in her chest.\nThough he didn’t look any older, she felt like she hadn’t seen him in years.\n“Ma’am,” Olem said, breaking the silence. He removed his hat.\n“Colonel Olem reporting in. I’ve brought you thirty-seven keelboats and\nfour hundred and eighty-nine fresh soldiers. I’ve also got extra supplies,\ncourtesy of Lady Chancellor Lindet. Sorry I’m not in uniform. I seem to\nhave left it back with the fleet.”\nVlora took two steps closer to him. “I’m sorry,” she whispered.\n“Eh?” Olem leaned toward her, one finger behind his ear.\n“I said I’m sorry.”\n“Ah, right. Just wanted to make sure I heard you.”\n“You’re a prick.”\nOlem pursed his lips, the corners turned up. “Feeling better?”\n“Slowly.”\n“Sorry I ran off. An uncle of mine used to say it’s better to walk off\nanger than to vent it. I, uh, had to take a long walk.”"

I, uh, had to take a long walk.”\nVlora closed the distance between them and slowly, timidly reached out\nto take Olem’s hand. Without warning, Olem snatched her into a hug. Vlora\nwrapped her arms around his middle, squeezing with all her might, her face\npressed against his chest. They remained that way for some time, until\nVlora finally took a deep breath and released him. She took half a step back\nand wiped the corners of her eyes. “I’ve missed you.”\n“I’ve missed you, too. I’ve only heard a bit of what you’ve been up to,\nbut it sounds like you’ve been a busy woman.”\n“That’s one way of putting it.”\nOlem produced a cigarette from his breast pocket and a match from his\ncuff. Within seconds he was producing a fine cloud of white smoke. He\ngave a little cough, took the cigarette out of his mouth, and leaned forward\nand kissed her. It was the faintest of pecks, but it made Vlora’s heart leap.\nEven the smell of his cigarette smoke was like the finest of colognes.\n“Will you forgive me?” she asked.\n“Already done.” He took a drag on the cigarette. “You and I are too busy\nto hold grudges. I was either going to come back, or not.”\n“I’m glad you did.”\n“So am I. Now, I’ve got a message for you from Lindet.”\nVlora’s elation was slightly tempered. “What does she want?”\n“She said for us to do what’s necessary.”\n“She’s not going to fight us for the godstone?” Vlora asked with a\nfrown.\n“That’s what she claims. She’s got a massive army, almost entirely\nconscripts, and they’re giving the Dynize the pit not all that far from\nLandfall. But I don’t think she can win a sustained war, and neither does\nshe. The Dynize troops are too experienced and they’re backed up by better\nsorcery.”\n“So we have her blessing to smash our way into Landfall and destroy the\ngodstone?”\n“That’s the sum of it, yes.”\n“That’s… a little disappointing.”\n“You’d rather we be spitting in her face throughout all of this?”\n“Of course I would.”\n“Me, too.” Olem smirked. “Unfortunately for us, she’s a realist. She\ngave me these keelboats and the location of one of her military caches. To\nbe honest, I’m glad you’re here, because I really wasn’t looking forward to\ncarrying all of these supplies overland to meet up with you.” He squeezed\nher hand and raised his chin to look toward the camp. “Do I hear\ngunshots?”\n“Screening maneuver. Our cavalry are keeping the Dynize away from us\nso they don’t see what I’m up to.”\n“How many Dynize?”\n“Three field armies, but one of their generals is worried about being\nstabbed in the back and isn’t going to attack us.”\n“Do you believe her?”\n“Doesn’t matter.”\nOlem cocked an eyebrow. “What do you mean, it doesn’t matter?”\nVlora pointed upriver. “You see that fog?”"

We’re going to make a break for the city.”\nOlem gave a low whistle. “That sounds very dangerous.”\n“It will be. But with the keelboats you just brought, we should have\nenough to transport the entire army—minus the cavalry. They’re going to\nscreen for us and then ride hard downriver. I intend to hit Sedial before he\neven knows we’re there.” Vlora sucked in a quick breath, waiting for Olem\nto voice his objections. He was, after all, her sounding board and\nconscience. If he thought the gamble was too risky, he would say so.\nInstead, he reached out and brushed some hair from her cheek. “I heard\nyou weren’t yourself.”\n“I wasn’t. For a while.”\n“Well, this sounds a lot like my lady. I’m glad you’re getting back to\nnormal. Is there any chance you still have one of my spare uniforms in your\ntrunk?

They\nnavigated the countless tunnels of the catacombs beneath the plateau, their\npath lit by flames flickering on the tips of Ichtracia’s gloved fingers. Michel\nlost track of all sense of time during their journey, but the sun had already\nrisen above the eastern horizon when they finally emerged into the streets of\nLandfall.\nHis first thought was that they were too late—but he didn’t smell smoke\nand Ichtracia gave no indication that the Depths had already been assaulted\nwith sorcery. His second thought was that something else was happening,\nand it didn’t take him long to spot what.\nWhole companies of soldiers had marched onto the plateau. Their helms\nand breastplates shone in the morning sun, blinding Michel as he and\nIchtracia dashed from one alleyway to the next. As if in answer to the\nsoldiers marching up the avenues, immense barricades had been thrown up\nto block their paths. Thousands of Palo, many of them likely still rioting\nand looting from the night before, had taken to the street with clubs,\nswords, blunderbusses, and any other weapon they could get a hold of.\nThey screamed at the soldiers, who ordered them to stand down, hurling\nclay shingles from the roofs and tearing up paving stones for heavier\nammunition.\nViolence wasn’t coming. Violence was here.\nMichel emerged onto one of the streets behind a battalion of Dynize\nsoldiers, all of them focused on Palo partisans shouting at them from\nsecond-story windows. He stared at the group in dismay as the commander\nvery clearly vacillated between retreat and attack.

Michel leapt back and grabbed\nher by the arm. “They’ll be fine for now,” he told her. “If we’re still alive,\nwe can come back and help after we stop the Privileged from destroying the\nDepths.”\nShe hesitated only a moment before lowering her hands and giving him\na determined nod. He tried to swallow his own terror at the realization that\nshe’d been a hairsbreadth from attacking her own people—something she’d\nclaimed she would avoid doing at all costs. He pulled her toward the next\nalley, where they cut across several more streets and then through a\ntenement, taking them behind the barricades.\nAs they neared the rim of Greenfire Depths, Ichtracia suddenly came to\na halt, throwing her hand up. Michel froze while she stood stock-still, her\nchin lifted, sniffing the air like a hound at the hunt. After what felt like an\neternity, she finally said, “They’re here.”\n“The Privileged?”\n“Yes. There are three of them, and they’re not even bothering to hide.”\nHer lip curled, and she pointed at the wall and then slightly to the left, and\nthen farther to the left of that. “There, there, and there.”\n“Do you know them?”\n“Doubtlessly. Our cabal is enormous, but not that enormous.”\nMichel watched the side of her face, wondering if she was about to get\ncold feet at the idea of attacking her companions. He could see a flurry of\nemotions playing out across her face, revealing that moment of weakness\nbefore her expression hardened once more. “It doesn’t matter who they\nare,” she continued. “They’ve come to slaughter innocent people.”\nShe moved slowly, carefully, in a half crouch as they emerged from the\nalley. Michel followed her to their next hiding spot—an overturned cart off\nto one side of the street—and she raised her hand once more and turned to\nhim. While her expression was cold and distant, he was surprised to see\ntears streaming down her cheeks. “Ichtracia?”\nShe suddenly reached out, touching his face with two gloved fingers.\n“I’ve liked you from the beginning, Michel. You made me laugh, but then\nyou made me care about things. Thanks for that.”\n“I’m kind of sick of people thanking me for doing my job,” Michel\nretorted with forced bravado. His own gut turned somersaults. “You don’t\nneed to thank me for anything. Just stay alive.”\n“I’m afraid that’s not very likely. There’s three of them and just one of\nme.” She wiped her sleeve across her face. “You shouldn’t make a\nPrivileged cry, Michel.”\n“We can do this,” Michel replied, biting his lip.\n“No. I can do this. You’re going to hide. You’re not in charge this time,\nlover. I am. Now, go find Jiniel. Help her organize whatever needs to be\ndone next.” Without another word, Ichtracia broke from their hiding spot\nand began to sprint.\nMichel tried to shout after her, but he choked on the words.

He looked over his shoulder to the east, where he could\nnow hear the reports of musket fire and the screams of men and women.\nThe south echoed with the same language of the rioters—and the soldiers\nsent to put them down.\nIt was just a few blocks back to the catacombs. He might find relative\nsafety down there—unless Ichtracia’s fight with her countrymen collapsed\nthe entire plateau. He grit his teeth and emerged from his hiding spot.\nIchtracia did not deserve to die alone.\nHe ran along the street, perpendicular to the alley Ichtracia had\ndisappeared into. The sound of an explosion nearly threw him off his feet,\nand he paused briefly to look toward the Depths, where a cloud of smoke\nnow rose above the buildings nearest to him. No, not the Depths. That\nsmoke was coming from the Rim. A thunderclap followed it, then a heart-\nwrenching sound like the world’s largest pane of glass had just shattered.\nMore smoke followed it.\nHe traveled three more blocks and took a hard right, dashing down an\nalleyway. The sorcerous cacophony continued, setting his teeth on edge and\nmaking his hands shake violently. Anyone with any brains would be\nsprinting in the opposite direction.\nHe emerged from the alley onto a narrow street that cut precariously\nalong the Rim, and stopped to get his bearings.\nA ways down, around the curve of the Rim, he caught sight of Ichtracia\nas a fireball appeared out of the sky and slammed into her. To Michel’s\nshock, she seemed to absorb the sorcery with a flick of her wrist, emerging\nfrom it unscathed. A section of the Rim suddenly collapsed, dust exploding\noutward. Michel caught sight of the first Privileged—a woman who leapt\nfrom the falling ledge, barely making it to solid ground before more\nfireballs appeared in the air above her head and shot toward Ichtracia.\nMichel searched for the second and third Privileged and found both of\nthem standing between himself and the ongoing fight. The second\nPrivileged watched the fight with clear confusion, gloved fingers pressed to\nhis lips. The third Privileged was less than two dozen paces away, with his\nback toward Michel. He regarded the battle with disinterest before turning\naway and looking down at the Depths. A few moments passed before he\nraised his hands, and one of the tallest buildings in the Depths became\nenveloped in flames.\nMichel crept toward the Privileged, trying to watch both Ichtracia’s duel\nand the sorcerer at the same time. Another fire started down in the Depths,\nand then another. The Privileged smiled to himself. If he spotted Michel in\nhis peripheral vision, he gave no indication. Michel removed the\nknuckledusters from his pocket.\nA scream suddenly cut through the morning air, punctuated by another\nexplosion. The Privileged looked toward Ichtracia’s fight. Ichtracia made an\nemphatic gesture, bringing her whole arm around in a chopping motion. Her\nopponent reeled, screamed again, and then slumped.\nThe Privileged closest to Michel gave an irritated sigh and turned to\nIchtracia, raising his hands.\n“Hey,” Michel said, sprinting the last few feet between them."

The Privileged gave a gentle “Oof” and disappeared off the Rim. A\nseries of crashes followed. Michel caught himself on a railing and peered\nover the edge, noting broken shingles and a torn storm drain. There was no\nsign of the body. Michel gripped the railing under him hard, trying to calm\nhis nerves, then looked up to find the second Privileged had turned to stare\nat him.\nHis eyes were drawn past the Privileged to Ichtracia, and past her to a\nfigure that had just emerged on the Rim over her shoulder, tugging on a pair\nof white, runed gloves.\nA fourth Privileged.\n“Look out!” Michel screamed.\n“I told you to run!” she shouted back. She flipped one hand toward him,\nand he felt himself suddenly lifted and thrown, cartwheeling head over\nheels up and over three-story buildings. The last glimpse he caught of\nIchtracia was one of surprise, as flame and rock crashed down over her in a\nspectacular explosion. Michel’s flight was swift but steady, and he soared\nalong in a clearly controlled bubble before it disappeared. He dropped the\nlast dozen feet into a pile of rubble, catching himself with his three-fingered\nhand. The whole left side of him lit up with pain.\nHe lay that way for several seconds before the thought of Ichtracia being\nconsumed by sorcery got him up and moving. He took one step, then\nanother, forcing his body along until he was knocked backward by an\nunseen force. The air was smashed from his lungs, and he was thrown into\nthe side of a building a split second before a rumbling sound reached him.\nDust and flame coalesced, threatening to suffocate him, until suddenly he\ncould feel air reaching his lungs once more.\nHe lay unmoving, trying to peer through the dust. When it had cleared\nenough to see, he found himself looking at… nothing. Every building\nbetween him and the Rim was gone, leveled to scattered rubble. The\ncorpses of unfortunate bystanders were barely recognizable in the mess, and\nit only took him a few moments of searching to see that Ichtracia was\nmissing.\nCHAPTER 58\nS\ntyke sat in the corridor outside his shared room, whittling horses by\nlamplight and listening to the distant sounds of a sleeping city. Talunlica\nwas, in his experience, an extremely quiet city after dark, even with the\nriots that consumed the daylight. But that didn’t mean it was silent—the\nrumble of delivery wagons, the march of patrolling city guards, the barking\nof dogs, the gentle lap of water against the compound’s outer wall. He\nfound those sounds, and the stillness of the compound, to be comforting in\nthese hours of sleeplessness.\nHe finished one of the horses, holding it up to the lamplight to make\nsmall, final adjustments, before setting it aside and preparing a new piece of\nwood for whittling. He was almost finished with the entire set. All the\nwhittling had given his hands something to do while he planned how,\nexactly, he was going to get Ka-poel near the godstone."

Styke longed\nfor it. His knife hand twitched constantly, and last night he’d spent several\nhours in the stables seeing to all of the Lancers’ horses, just to give himself\nsomething to do. He longed to throw himself back in the saddle, lower a\nlance, and charge an enemy.\nBut he had to keep himself in check. He was a guest here. Ka-poel and\nCeline were under his protection, and he was under Etzi’s protection. He\ndid not feel guilt over the mob attack yesterday, but he understood that it\nmay have been in response to his murder of Ji-Patten and that he shouldn’t\nbe personally involved in further escalation. No need to push Etzi’s\nhospitality.\nStyke heard a throat clear and looked up from his whittling, expecting to\nfind Etzi or Maetle out for a midnight stroll. Instead, he discovered a figure\ndressed in a loose Dynize traveling smock leaning on a wall at the end of\nthe corridor as if he’d been watching Styke for several minutes.\n“Jackal?” Styke asked cautiously.\nThe hood of the traveling cloak was thrown back to reveal the Palo\nwarrior. Jackal approached, coming into the light of the lantern and\nlowering himself down beside Styke as if they were meeting casually in a\npark or on the street. Jackal had gotten significantly more weather-beaten in\nthe last nine days: cheeks dark, hair looking redder. Perhaps it was the\nclothing, but he seemed oddly more Dynize, as if he’d been absorbing the\nenergy of the people.\n“Took you long enough,” Styke snorted.\n“Sorry. Took me longer than I expected to find Ibana—an alarm was put\nout after my escape and I had to take a longer route.”\n“But you did find her?” Styke set his whittling aside and stared at Jackal\neagerly.\n“Once I was away from the godstone, I just needed to avoid patrols and\nlisten to the spirits.” Jackal tapped the side of his head.\n“And?”\n“Roughly ninety percent of our fleet arrived safely. They put to shore at\nthe rendezvous point almost a month ago. Just as Orz told us, the\nrendezvous was deep enough in the swamp that they haven’t been\ndiscovered. The Dynize claim they tamed the Jagged Fens, but they’ve\nreally only cleaned up a corridor along the main highway. Everywhere\nelse…” Jackal shrugged. “Nobody goes that deep into the swamp, and\nIbana has been being really damned careful. She even dismissed the fleet so\nthey wouldn’t be spotted from the sea.”\nStyke felt his eyes widen. “Dismiss the fleet? You’re joking.”\n“Ibana seems confident that we’ll be able to commandeer a fleet once\nwe’ve accomplished our task.”\n“Does she have any idea how badly we messed up with the maps?”\nStyke gestured at the city around them.\n“Some,” Jackal answered hesitantly. “She’s been using our Palo as\nscouts, hoping they blend in.

They’ve hunted to conserve rations and stayed\nwell away from the roads. They’ve lost some soldiers and horses to the\nravages of the swamp, but were in higher spirits than I would have\nexpected. So far, they haven’t been discovered.”\n“You updated them?”\n“I did. Ibana wasn’t happy.”\n“I can imagine.”\n“But she’s pleased that you’re alive. She hid it well, but I could tell.”\n“What do you mean she ‘hid it well’?”\n“There was a lot of swearing and cursing your name. I got the feeling\nthat she regretted dismissing the fleet and probably would have gone back\nto Fatrasta by now if she hadn’t.” Jackal hesitated again, long enough that\nStyke could tell he wanted to say something else.\n“Spit it out,” Styke said.\n“Well,” Jackal drew out the word. “They’re running low on rations. Now\nthat Ibana knows you’re alive, and knows about Talunlica, she wants to\nmove on the city.”\nStyke felt his stomach lurch. His wish for something to happen was\nabout to come true. “How soon?”\n“She was mobilizing everyone before I left.”\n“How long ago?”\n“Two days.”\n“Shit.” Styke spat the word and resisted the urge to throw his whittling\nknife across the corridor. “She needs to hold off. Sedial’s goons are using\nthe Lancers still imprisoned against me—the moment they find out we have\nan army here, they’ll execute the lot.”\n“I told her about Zak. She said it was an acceptable loss.”\nStyke felt his hackles rise. “How could you possibly know about Zak?\nYou were two days out of the city when it happened.”\nJackal tapped the side of his head again. The damned spirits.\nStyke swore. “She wants to get me killed, too?”\n“She assumes you’re safe enough.”\n“Like pit I am. Etzi has stood up for us so far, but I can’t imagine me\nand Ka-poel will be welcome when they find out we have a foreign army on\ntheir shores.”\nJackal spread his hands as a show of helplessness. “Ibana is champing at\nthe bit.”\n“No stopping her. Damn it, she’s supposed to be the cautious one.”\nStyke rubbed furiously at his Lancer ring with one thumb. He should\nprobably be happy to hear that the Mad Lancers were coming to get him.\nBut the chaos in the city was too unpredictable. The appearance of a foreign\narmy might make Talunlica fall to bits, allowing them to storm in and crush\nthe city garrison. Or it might unite the Dynize against a common threat.\nStyke was willing to bet it would do the latter.\n“All right,” he breathed. “This is what we’re going to do. I need you to\nreturn to Ibana as quickly as possible. If you can reach her before she leaves\nher hiding spot, you need to tell her to stay put—a direct order from me.

It’ll be a\ntempting target for her, but I want to have a couple of days to get me and\nthe others out. Tell her to come within four miles and hold for my order. If\nshe doesn’t hear from me within a couple days, she can torch the city.”\n“Four miles, two days.” Jackal nodded. “I’ll ride as fast as I can.”\n“Good. Get moving.”\nJackal disappeared as quickly as he’d appeared. Styke heard the scrape\nof someone shimmying over the compound wall but nothing else. He\nlistened for several minutes and then, troubled, picked his whittling back\nup. No hope of sleep now, not unless he could calm himself down a little—\nand his mind was racing, his heart eager for a fight, but his thoughts\ncautious.\nHe was a fighter, not a strategist. A million variables could make things\ngo wrong between now and Ibana’s arrival. He resisted the urge to bolt right\naway—to saddle his horse, grab Ka-poel and Celine, and follow Jackal out\nof the city. Never mind the risk of such a flight; he refused to leave Markus,\nSunin, and the rest to die in a Dynize prison.\nHe finally tossed aside his whittling and climbed to his feet.\nIt had been days since he’d spoken to Orz. The dragonman had been\ngiven a small recovery room just beside Maetle’s infirmary, and according\nto the compound gossip, he was healing at an astonishing speed. He’d been\nseen walking on his own—albeit slowly—just yesterday. Unfortunately,\nStyke needed more than just “walking” right now. He approached Orz’s\nquarters and knocked gently on the door before stepping inside. There\nwasn’t much room to maneuver. Like every other building in the\ncompound, it had been built to take up as little space as possible. Just\nstepping inside put Styke immediately beside the one small bed.\nStyke felt something press against his inner thigh. The small hairs on the\nback of his neck stood on end. “It’s Styke,” he said.\n“Should have known,” Orz answered. “The emperor doesn’t have any\nassassins that cast that big of a shadow.” Orz’s voice was weak, not much\nabove a whisper. He pulled his knife away. “You have news?”\nStyke lowered himself down beside Orz’s head. The dragonman hadn’t\nattempted to sit up, eyeballing Styke from his supine position. Styke\ncouldn’t help but wonder if he didn’t want to move, or couldn’t. “Why does\neveryone seem to know things before me?”\n“I heard someone slip over the wall, then bits of a whispered\nconversation, and then they went back over the wall. I can only assume it’s\nthe man you had break out of prison the day I woke up. Jackal, right?”\n“That was halfway across the compound,” Styke grumbled.\n“I have very good hearing, and it’s hard to sleep when Maetle won’t give\nme more mala until tomorrow night.”\nStyke tapped the side of his ring. “You’re right, I have news. Jackal\nfound Ibana.”"

        "text": "me more mala until tomorrow night.”\nStyke tapped the side of his ring. “You’re right, I have news. Jackal\nfound Ibana.”\n“Is she where she was supposed to be?”\n“She is, and by some miracle she hasn’t been discovered yet. But she’s\nrunning low on rations and champing at the bit. As far as we know, she left\nthe swamp the moment Jackal headed back to find me.”\n“So news might reach the city at any time.” Orz sounded resigned.\n“Correct.”\n“They’ll come for us,” Orz said. “It’s just the excuse Sedial’s people will\nneed—perfectly justified.”\n“Agreed.”\n“And Etzi won’t be able to protect us, whether or not he wants to. We\nshould leave tonight.”\nStyke held up two fingers, unsure as to whether Orz could see them.\n“First, I’m not sure if you can ride. Second, I’m not leaving the rest of my\nLancers in that prison to be tortured and executed.”\n“I can ride,” Orz said. He sat up, as if to emphasize his health, but nearly\ntoppled out of the bed. Styke caught him by his shoulder to steady him.\n“I’m not leaving without them,” Styke reiterated. “I don’t mind throwing\nyou over a saddle and putting your recovery back weeks—you’ll survive.\nBut the others…” Styke trailed off. He could practically feel Orz’s\ndisagreement. He probably agreed with Ibana; the captured soldiers were\nacceptable casualties. If they were twenty random recruits, Styke might\nagree. But these were the oldest of his Lancers, men and women who’d\nbeen with him since the very beginning of the Fatrastan War for\nIndependence, and some of them from even before that. “Do I tell Etzi\nabout the army?”\nOrz was silent for some time. Styke was beginning to think he’d nodded\noff, when he finally spoke again. “Etzi told me that you killed Ji-Patten.”\n“I did.”\n“You gave him one of Ji-Patten’s knives. Who is the other for?”\n“Markus. Zak’s brother.”\nAnother long pause. “I would have liked to have killed him myself.”\n“It wasn’t a fair fight.”\n“Etzi told me that, too.” Orz hesitated. “You should know something.”\n“What is that?”\n“Etzi is making plans. Plans that he hasn’t mentioned to you.”\nStyke took a sharp breath. “And?”\n“He sees an opportunity in Ka-poel. He’s been spending a lot of time\nwith her as of late.”\n“No one told me this.” Styke scowled.\n“It has little to do with you, and everything to do with her.”\n“She is my ward.” Styke felt himself growing angry and not a little bit\nconfused. The fact that he hadn’t noticed the two of them speaking even\nonce indicated that they were going behind his back—and what purpose\nwould there be in that unless it was about a betrayal?\n“It doesn’t involve you,” Orz insisted, as if reading Styke’s mind. “You\nhave enough to think about that Ka-poel didn’t want to bring it to your\nattention.”\n“What is ‘it’?” Styke demanded.\n“I don’t know exactly.”"

She wants nothing more\nthan to destroy the godstone and return to Fatrasta. But Etzi wants to use\nher as a counter for Sedial. She has the power, and she has the birthright.\nAll she has to do is use them.”\n“And stick her neck into Dynize politics. The moment Sedial finds out\nfor certain that Ka-poel is here, he will send dragonmen to fetch her.”\n“Etzi has been cautious,” Orz said defensively.\n“He better damn well have been.” Styke swore. First Ibana, and now Ka-\npoel. He hadn’t had control of things for a month, but what little agency he\ndid have seemed to have disappeared in a puff of smoke. Nothing to do now\nbut wait for the tidal wave to hit and hope he could ride it out. “What do I\ndo with this?” he whispered to himself.\nThere was a beat of silence, and then Orz said, “If Ka-poel agrees to\nwork with Etzi and his allies, you might be protected. She claims her\nbirthright as an adviser of the emperor, denounces Ka-Sedial and the war\nwith Fatrasta, and claims you and the Lancers as her bodyguard. It won’t go\ndown easily, but it might mean that the city doesn’t immediately try to\nexecute you and march an army out to meet Ibana.”\n“That sounds like a whole lot of being hopeful,” Styke growled.\n“I agree. But sometimes that’s all we can do.”\n“You realize if this all goes south, you’re going to die with me, right?”\nStyke said petulantly.\n“I am very aware,” Orz replied.\n“Good. I just want to make sure.” He felt a swirl of emotions, none of\nthem positive. Beneath the eagerness to fight and the anger at this\nuncertainty, he felt fear—the world was about to explode around him, and\nCeline would no doubt be caught in the maelstrom. Etzi’s Household, too,\nand though he didn’t want to admit it, he did care. Etzi had shown his true\ncolors yesterday, defending Styke at the cost of his own soldiers. He’d been\na protective, loyal host, and the city was about to find out he’d been\nharboring an enemy officer. No matter how he spun it, he would lose out.\nIt did not leave a good feeling in the pit of Styke’s stomach.\n“You should try to get some sleep,” Orz said gently.\n“Small chance of that.” Styke stood up, turning toward the door.\n“Then what will you do?”\n“The politics of all this are well beyond me, so I’m going to do the one\nthing I can to prepare: sharpen my knife and polish my armor.”\nCHAPTER 59"

She\npracticed deep, calming breaths as the befuddlement of sleep fled her mind.\nShe was among friends, traveling quickly and with a plan. She was still\nLady Vlora Flint, a former powder mage and current military commander.\nThose simple realities made her feel only marginally better. Something\nwas wrong, and she couldn’t quite place it.\nA small gasp escaped from her lips, and she rolled over to feel around in\nthe bedroll beside hers. It was empty and cold—it hadn’t been occupied for\nsome time. But it was there. Olem had returned. She continued her\nbreathing exercises and stumbled to her feet, wrapping a blanket around her\nshoulders. Bent almost double, she crept through the hold by feel alone,\nmaking her way out to the deck of the keelboat.\nThe deck was covered in the gently snoring forms of her bodyguard and\nthe resting polers, who, for sixteen hours each day, propelled the boat down\nthe Hadshaw. As her personal vessel, it was much less crowded than the rest\nof the flotilla, and she was able to pick her way among the sleeping bodies\nwithout the risk of actually stepping on anyone. She approached the stern,\nwhere a lantern hung at head height illuminating a single figure sitting with\nhis legs hanging off the deck. She would have been able to identify that\nsilhouette anywhere, but the whiff of cigarette smoke and the ember\nglowing in the dark removed all doubt.\nShe felt her mysterious anxiety drop slightly as she sat down beside\nOlem, her feet swinging just a couple of inches above the water.\n“You should be sleeping,” he said gently.\n“I don’t feel very well.”\n“Sick?”\n“I don’t think so.” She searched for a way to describe it. “It’s almost a\ngut feeling, like I know something is going to go wrong.”\n“That’s natural. We’re about to attack a superior force at their\nstronghold.”\n“But it’s not that,” Vlora continued.\n“You’re sure?” She could see him looking at her peculiarly by the\nlantern light.\n“I don’t know.” She gave a frustrated sigh. It felt like her body was\ntrying to tell her something, but she had absolutely no sense of what. It\nmade her feel helpless and angry. She tried to shake it off. “Have we heard\nanything from Delia’s people since we set off down the river?”\n“No. The provosts managed to claim a handful of keelboats for\nthemselves, so I know they’re back there somewhere.”\n“Delia is probably furious that we’re striking for the Dynize heart. We\nshould have left them behind.”\n“Little chance of that.”\n“I suppose we can only hope we ruined whatever deal she struck with\nKa-Sedial’s generals. Oh well. What time is it?”\n“I think it’s around three.”"

What time is it?”\n“I think it’s around three.”\n“How far from Landfall are we?”\n“Twenty miles, give or take.”\n“That close?” Vlora pictured a map in her mind. “We must have passed\nthe Battle of Windy River site yesterday, then?”\n“We did.”\n“I didn’t even notice.” She passed a hand across her face.\n“You’ve been a bit preoccupied,” Olem said reassuringly, reaching out\nto squeeze her hand.\nThey’d spent the last few days in the keelboat together, rarely more than\na couple dozen paces apart, and somehow it felt like Olem had never left.\nHaving him close again was like having a limb restored, and she wondered\nwhether the sense of loss that had come with the loss of her sorcery had, in\npart, been a sense of loss of him. It seemed likely. There was still a thin\nbarrier between them—hesitations, unshared thoughts—but it felt like\nsomething that would heal in time.\nThen why did she feel so strangely right now?\n“We should land tomorrow afternoon,” Vlora told him. “Everyone has\ntheir orders?”\nOlem lifted his gaze to look out over the river, where they could see the\nlights of dozens of their immense flotilla of keelboats. “They do,” he\nconfirmed. “We’re moving too fast for scouts to be much good, but the\nriders we’ve sent out indicate that this region is almost abandoned. Lindet’s\nforces are fifty miles or so to our west, so that’s where all of the Dynize\narmies are focused. Aside from the little bit of traffic we’ve come across,\nthis stretch is almost entirely undefended.”\n“Could it be a trap?”\nOlem chuckled. “That nervous, huh?”\n“I’m serious!”\n“I don’t think even Sedial could anticipate that you’d slip past three of\nhis field armies and rush downriver in just a handful of days to confront\nhim. If he’s foreseen it, then we deserve to get our teeth kicked in.”\n“That’s not reassuring.” Vlora paused, considering all the plans and\ncontingencies she’d made. During the day, looking upon her flotilla and\nexcited by their swift travel, it was easy to feel as if she was on top of\neverything. But in the darkness of the night, when life felt so very fragile\nand the world so big, all the doubts began to creep in. What if her plans\nweren’t good enough? What if her army wasn’t up to the job? What if she\nwasn’t? What if Sedial had more sorcery at his call, or men guarding his\ndoor, than she had expected?\n“I’ve been putting on a confident face for the general staff to keep them\non board with this plan,” Vlora admitted, “but I’m terrified that I’m about to\nget us all killed.”\n“Hm,” Olem grunted. “You have been downplaying the danger, but I\ndon’t think you’re fooling anyone. We all know this is a mad dash to death\nor victory. Bo and Nila definitely do. The general staff are not a bunch of\nfools. Even the soldiers can sense it.”"

Even the soldiers can sense it.”\nVlora rubbed her eyes. “I should be taking it slower. I should have\ndismantled those three armies piece by piece and marched our way down\nthe river destroying everything in our path slowly, cautiously. The Adran\nway.”\n“That’s not the Adran way.” Olem laughed.\nShe narrowed her eyes at him. “I don’t think you’re taking this\nseriously.”\n“Do you remember,” he went on, “when Tamas tried to flank the Kez\nforces outside of Budwiel by transporting three brigades through a cave\nsystem?”\n“Yes. And that didn’t work out well for us.”\n“I could name several dozen maneuvers in Tamas’s career that were\nequally as brash. Most of them did work out. The Adran way is to be the\nbest at everything. Fewer troops, but better trained with better equipment\nand stronger lines. Quality over quantity. Driving ourselves like a spike\nright into Sedial’s heart is the Adran way. The general staff knows that. And\nremember that most of them were present for Kresimir. They know the\ndangers we’re facing unless we prevent Sedial from using that stone. They\nbelieve in the cause. They believe in you.”\nVlora laid her head on Olem’s shoulder. “Maybe you’re right. I just need\nto stop worrying.”\n“Worrying is fine. But you shouldn’t let it keep you from sleeping. You,\nof all people, need rest.”\n“I’m telling you, I don’t think it’s the worry. I… just feel strange.” She\nrubbed her arms. “Jittery! That’s the word. It must just be nerves.”\nAt the word “jittery,” Olem gave her a sharp glance. Vlora ignored it.\nThere wasn’t anything she could do but try to get some sleep. She’d already\nprepared all that she could, and her officers were taking care of all the\nsmaller details. There was nothing to get excited about until her flotilla was\nspotted by the Dynize.\nShe looked over her shoulder, letting her gaze cross the sleeping forms\non the deck and then turning it toward the river. Somewhere along the\nflotilla she could hear someone singing softly—no doubt a soldier who was\nhaving a hard time sleeping. It was a strange feeling, floating on a river the\nnight before a battle with keelboat decks instead of tents, lanterns instead of\ncookfires, and the lapping of the water against the shores instead of the call\nof sentries. Somewhere in the distance she heard a horse whinny, and\nwondered how the cavalry were getting on. They’d ridden alongside the\nriver, pushing themselves hard to keep up with the keelboats, and would be\nvery tired by the time they reached Landfall. But their presence on the shore\ngave Vlora some comfort that her flotilla wouldn’t be unexpectedly flanked.\nBeside her, Olem suddenly rustled. “Stay here,” he said. “I’ll be right\nback.” He climbed to his feet and disappeared into the cabin, leaving her\nalone in the darkness for a minute or two.

When he returned, she felt a\ngoblet pushed into her hand.\n“What’s this?”\n“A bit of wine. Nothing fantastic, but…”\n“Is there something to celebrate?” Vlora asked, giving it a sniff.\nShe could make out a cautious smile on Olem’s face. “Just a hunch that\nyou needed something to take the edge off.”\nVlora snorted. “I wish it would take the edge off. Even being powder\nblind I can’t get drunk.” She took a hefty gulp of the wine anyway. She’d\nalready swallowed when she tasted something peculiar, and then the full\nbrunt of it hit her. “By Adom,” she swore. “This is terrible.” The sulfuric\ntaste clung to her tongue no matter how much she sputtered. “What the pit\nis in…”\nShe trailed off as a little thrill spread throughout her mouth and into her\nblood and mind, lighting up her senses in a familiar, but decidedly subdued\nmanner. Her hands began to tremble with excitement.\n“Powder,” Olem said. “Just a small spoonful.”\n“That’s a good way to ruin a cup of wine,” Vlora said, downing the rest\nof her glass. She tried not to let her excitement get the better of her as her\nsenses sharpened. The sound of distant singing grew louder, the darkness of\nthe night shifting before her eyes until she could pierce it without squinting.\nEven the terrible taste of the wine grew more pronounced. Her mind\nseemed to speed up to compensate for all this new information. She felt her\nhands tremble and her face flush. “How the pit…” she began, turning\ntoward Olem.\nHe was watching her eagerly. “Is it working?”\n“It is.”\nA grin cracked his face and he gave a little sigh of relief. “You would\nhave been furious at me if it hadn’t.”\nVlora held her hand horizontally in front of her face. It only took a brief\nsurge of willpower to still the trembling. The aches and pains and\nexhaustion were all still there, but they were in a distant place, locked in the\ncorner of her mind, overpowered by the sudden arrival of her powder\ntrance. “How did you know?”\n“Your body was giving signs of withdrawal.”\n“I don’t follow.”\n“That strange feeling you described,” Olem said, waving one of his\ncigarettes under her nose. “It sounded a lot like how I feel when I haven’t\nhad one of these for a couple of days. It was the word ‘jittery’ that pulled it\ntogether for me. Cigarettes, mala, coffee. They don’t affect powder mages\nthe same way they do other people, but the fact that your body was\nsuddenly having withdrawal effects, months after you lost your sorcery…”\nHis grin grew wider. “Well? How is it?”\nVlora cautiously reached out with her senses. She could sense all the\npowder nearby, in the holds of the keelboats and in the horns and wrapped\ncharges of the soldiers. She tried to temper her excitement and pulled away\nfrom it all mentally to try for a self-diagnosis. “Dulled.”\n“In what way?”"

She tried to temper her excitement and pulled away\nfrom it all mentally to try for a self-diagnosis. “Dulled.”\n“In what way?”\n“Just… not as sharp as it used to be. I can’t see as well in the dark, and\nthe sounds aren’t as pronounced. Maybe it’s the wine you mixed it with, but\nI think I should be cautious.”\n“I agree. Your body is still healing.”\nShe let out a shaky laugh and could hear her own relief in it. Her sorcery\nwas back! Perhaps not as strong as it once was, but it was there. She could\ncontinue to heal. She could be a mage again. “It’s going to be a pit of a time\nholding back once we get to Landfall.”\n“I expect you to do just that. Let Davd do the heavy lifting.”\nVlora clenched her fists, unclenched them, and tried to stop grinning.\nFor the first time in months the urge to blow something up was a joyous one\nrather than a furious reaction that ended in tears. She forced herself to pull\nback with her senses. More than enough chance to test them tomorrow. And\nOlem was right. She needed to be careful. Her sorcery might be back, but it\ncould also be fragile. She would only use it in an emergency.\nLeaning over, she kissed Olem gently. “Thank you.”\n“You would have figured it out eventually. But I know that jittery\nfeeling.” He tapped the side of his nose. “Now, have I woken you up or do\nyou think you can get some more sleep?”\n“I don’t ever want to sleep again.” Vlora looked out over the water once\nmore. Her body had been her enemy these last couple of months. It was still\na tangled mess of scars and still-healing wounds, but it was now tense with\nthe desire for action. She could move her arms without hurting. Pit, she\nmight actually be able to fight again. She got to her feet and looked down at\nOlem. “We might die tomorrow.”\n“Always a possibility,” he conceded.\n“Join me in the cabin?”\nOlem took one last drag, flicked his cigarette into the water, and stood\nup. “Lead on, Lady Flint.”\nCHAPTER 60\nS\ntyke met with Etzi and Ka-poel on the small guard tower overlooking the\ncauseway that connected Etzi’s compound with the rest of the city. Beyond\nthem, smoke rose from the northwest corner of the city and a mob of\ncommoners swept down the closest main avenue just out of musket range,\nwaving weapons and shouting angrily. Pavers, stones, and bricks were\nloosened and thrown through windows as the mob passed a nearby\ncollection of shops, and citizens fled in all directions ahead of the chaos.\nAt this range, it was impossible to tell whether the mob was composed\nof Sedial’s hired crew, an angry response to the former, or another group\naltogether that had formed spontaneously just to cause destruction.\nWhoever they were, they didn’t seem interested in the causeway or the\nwalled compound, a fact that visibly relieved the Household guard manning\nthe walls.\nEtzi himself watched the action with a stricken expression, alternating\nevery few moments between grief and anger. “Sedial thought he could"

A\ncloud of dust rose from a suddenly blank spot on the city vista, and Styke\ncould only assume that one of the mobs had pulled down an entire city\nguard tower.\n“Nobody can truly control a mob,” Styke said, removing his ring and\nscratching beneath it.\n“The Great Ka is a thousand miles away. He doesn’t give a shit what’s\nhappening here.” Etzi struck a fist against his palm. “Damned fool.” He\ntook a few deep breaths and turned to Styke and Ka-poel, looking them up\nand down for several moments before addressing Styke. “Orz says he told\nyou about our dealings?” He gestured between himself and Ka-poel.\nStyke tried not to be annoyed that he’d been left out. “He just said that\nyou’ve been trying to get Ka-poel to enter the political arena.”\n“More or less.”\nStyke raised an eyebrow at Ka-poel.\nI haven’t decided yet, Ka-poel gestured.\n“You need to decide,” Etzi said urgently. “This is quickly growing\nbeyond anyone’s control. Mobs are crisscrossing the city, making it difficult\nfor Households to communicate. Another couple of days and we may be cut\noff for weeks, left to hunker down behind the walls, where we try not to\nattract the attention of the rabble.”\n“Where’s the city guard?” Styke asked.\n“Half of them have joined the mobs.” Etzi threw his hands up. “The rest\nhave retired to their own Households to help keep order—I called back\ntwenty of my own to man the walls.” He fell silent, glaring at Ka-poel as if\nwilling her to give him an answer, and then finally turning back to Styke.\nHe set his jaw. “This is only going to get worse. Word has arrived of an\narmy south of the city.” His eyes narrowed. “Your army.”\nStyke leaned against the top of the compound wall, returning Etzi’s gaze\ncoolly. So much for Jackal getting back to Ibana and keeping the Mad\nLancers out of sight. “Oh,” he replied.\n“Oh? Is that it?” Etzi clenched his fists, unclenched them, and then tried\nto pace. He gave up when the space atop the tower proved too small.\n“You’ve taken my hospitality, and I’ve done you the courtesy of asking no\nquestions, only to find out that you’ve somehow managed to land several\nthousand cavalry on my shores.”\nStyke drew his knife and used the tip to pick dirt from beneath his\nfingernails. “You said you didn’t want to know.”\n“An enemy army is need-to-know amounts of urgency.”\n“How much do you know?” Styke asked.\n“Orz has told me everything. I know about your separation from the\nfleet, your deal with him, and your uncertainty over the army. I also know"

        "text": "“How much do you know?” Styke asked.\n“Orz has told me everything. I know about your separation from the\nfleet, your deal with him, and your uncertainty over the army. I also know\nthat you’ve come here to attempt to destroy the godstone.” His gaze flicked\nto Ka-poel, who returned the glance without expression.\nStyke adjusted his stance casually, sweeping a quick look across the\ncourtyard below them. Aside from the handful of guards manning the walls,\nno one had gathered in ambush or seemed prepared to rush him. Etzi hadn’t\nsummoned him to some sort of trap, which meant he wasn’t about to turn\non him.\nYet.\nHe returned his knife to its sheath and spread his hands. “So you know\neverything now. What are you going to do?”\n“Under normal circumstances, there would already be a few dragonmen\nand dozens of city guard here to arrest you. The last message I got from my\nallies on the Quorum indicated that most everyone suspects that you have\nsomething to do with that army.”\n“But?” Styke voiced the unsaid word.\n“But… no one is in any state to do anything about it. Factionalism is the\nword of the day. Most of our generals and fighting men are in Fatrasta.\nWhat few we have will remain with their Households, and I have no doubt\nthose Households will hunker behind their walls and hope that your cavalry\nwill find it just as difficult to enter the city as the guard is finding it to\nrestore order.”\nStyke snorted. “And if my soldiers decide to enter and put down the\nmob at the tip of a sword?”\n“You may cow us by destroying an army or two, if it comes to that,” Etzi\nsaid flatly, “but this is a city of a million people, and their blood is already\nup. Do you think even the best-trained cavalry in the world can tame that\nwith a mere few thousand?”\nStyke grunted a response. Etzi was probably right. He didn’t want the\nMad Lancers to have anything to do with dozens—maybe hundreds—of\nroaming mobs. Their one advantage was that they had a clear goal. Getting\ninto the city, securing the godstone, and giving Ka-poel time to destroy it…\nwell, that might be within reach.\nThough when he ran the thought through his head a few times, it\nsounded more and more absurd. “You didn’t answer my question,” Styke\nsaid. “What are you going to do?”\nEtzi stared at a new column of smoke just beginning to rise from the\nsouth. He scowled at it for a few moments. “I don’t care about the\ngodstone,” he said quietly. “Other Households might risk lives to protect it,\nbut not me. I’m going to get you and Orz out of the city, and my\nresponsibility for you will be finished. Then I’m going to try to help rally\nthe Household Quorum to fight you.”\nStyke knew it would go easier on both of them if they just tried to kill\neach other right now. But he could also see the defeated frustration in Etzi’s\neyes, and he knew for himself that he wasn’t about to turn on his host in\ncold blood. Etzi had been too good to him. “I’m not leaving without my\nsoldiers.”"

Etzi had been too good to him. “I’m not leaving without my\nsoldiers.”\n“Orz said you’d say that.” Etzi’s scowl deepened. “As soon as the rest of\nmy Household comes in from the city guard, I’m sending them to the\nprison, where they will have orders to force their way in, retrieve your\nsoldiers, and bring them back here. After that”—he made a “go away”\ngesture—“I’ll turn you out.”\n“Won’t that be dangerous?”\n“Extremely. That short journey might take them the rest of the day. But\nif it gets you out of the city without bloodshed…” Etzi turned his attention\nback to Ka-poel, staring at her for several moments. When no answer was\nforthcoming, he gave a frustrated sigh and climbed down from the guard\ntower.\nStyke watched a mob across the water to the north. They looked like\nthey were chasing someone, but they were too far away to tell. “This\ndealing you’ve had with Etzi,” he said. “What does he want?” He turned\nback to Ka-poel and watched her hands.\nShe pursed her lips. I wasn’t trying to go behind your back, she gestured.\n“That’s not what I asked.”\nThey want me to get involved.\n“I picked up on that.”\nDeeply involved. They want to present me to the emperor to take Ka-\nSedial’s place as his highest adviser.\nJust as Orz had suggested. Styke wondered what Etzi’s coalition hoped\nto gain from this. Did they plan on using her as a puppet? Because if so,\nthey were about to bite off more than they could chew. He glanced at the\nmobs and thought of Zak’s execution. Sedial projected enough fear from a\nthousand miles away to put a whole city on edge and bend Households to\nhis will. Perhaps Etzi and his friends were just so desperate that they’d cling\nto anything.\n“They know exactly who you are?”\nShe nodded.\n“And they believe you?”\nAnother nod, this time less certain. It may not matter to them. I’m a\npowerful bone-eye, more than strong enough to challenge Sedial. Perhaps\nthat’s all they care about.\n“But you haven’t given them an answer.”\nKa-poel hesitated.\n“You’re waiting for something,” Styke realized aloud.\nA nod.\n“What?”\nTaniel.\nStyke frowned, then raised his eyebrows as he caught up mentally. She’d\nmentioned before that Taniel planned on catching up with him, but it had\nslipped his mind in the weeks since. “Taniel’s coming here. To the city?”\nHe’s currently on a fast ship heading toward us. I’m not going to throw\nmyself into Dynize politics without consulting him.\nStyke let out an uneasy breath. Taniel was a small army all on his own.\nHaving him nearby would be an awfully huge relief. “Do you know how\nlong until he arrives?”\nShe shook her head. Days?

Once he had his soldiers back, he’d ride out of the\ncity and join up with Ibana. They’d have to strategize from there, but he\ndeeply suspected that they’d be riding back in within twenty-four hours,\nplowing through any mobs and guardsmen who got in their way. One\nobjective. Accomplish, then pull out.\nHe wondered how hard it would be to kidnap or assassinate the emperor\nonce they’d breached the palace complex. That might be their ransom back\nto Fatrasta.\nHe and Ka-poel watched the city for some time. A contingent of city\nguard soon approached down the causeway, were hailed by one of the\nwatchmen, and let in. Less than an hour later, just as the afternoon began to\nwane, forty heavily armed and armored Household guardsmen were sent\nback down the causeway, heading toward the prison to retrieve Styke’s\nsoldiers.\nHe knew he should be with them, but Etzi had refused the offer. Styke’s\npresence would just attract the attention of the mobs. And he was probably\nright. It didn’t make Styke feel any better, letting another man’s soldiers\nfight his battle for him.\nStyke remained on the guard tower, watching the city, long after Ka-poel\nhad headed back into the compound. Celine ran through the courtyard a\nhandful of times, but he was otherwise left to his own devices.\nHe was about to head down to the canteen when a small group of\nhorsemen appeared at the causeway, galloping at full speed out of the street\nand slowing only when they reached the gate. A flurry of words were\nexchanged between the couple of guards remaining in the compound and\nthe new arrivals. Etzi was summoned and ordered the gate opened.\nThe group consisted of three women and two men. They were dusty,\nwild-eyed, and breathless from a hard ride. Four of them were dressed in\nHousehold livery and heavily armed, while the fifth carried herself with the\nunmistakable air of a politician. A Household head, probably. Styke noted\ncuts on all five of the horses, as if they’d ridden straight through the center\nof a mob to get here.\nStyke climbed down from the guard tower to join Etzi and his guests in\nthe courtyard.\nA terse greeting was exchanged, and their leader eyeballed Styke. “We\nhave to talk,” she said to Etzi, her voice shaky.\n“Ben,” Etzi said by way of introduction, “this is Meln-Sika, one of my\nstaunchest allies and head of the Sika Household. Would you mind giving\nus some privacy? Sika, we can speak in my office.”\n“No.” The woman threw her hand up toward Styke. “Let the foreigner\nlisten. We may need him.”\nStyke had already begun to head toward the canteen. He stopped himself\nand turned back, head cocked. There was real fear in Sika’s voice.\nSomething more than fear of the mobs. Etzi scowled between Styke and\nSika, then gestured Styke to come in close.\nSika rummaged around inside her shirt for a moment and drew out a\ncard."

His\neyes scanned the single page. His face grew pale. He got to the bottom and\nthen began to read it again, fingers trembling. He finally handed it back. “A\npurge order?” he whispered.\n“From the Great Ka himself,” Sika spat.\n“I don’t understand,” Styke interjected. Even as the words left his\nmouth, something clicked in the back of his head; these might be the\nmysterious orders that Ji-Patten had alluded to the night he died.\nEtzi and Sika exchanged a glance. “There’s more,” Sika told Etzi, then\nturned toward Styke to include him in the explanation. “Last night, a mob\nappeared outside of the Donnolian Household—one of our allies. From\nwhat I’ve been able to gather from the survivors, the mob was better armed\nthan most and included a few city guardsmen. They claimed to have an\narrest warrant for Donnolian himself. They even had legal paperwork. Once\nDonnolian opened the gates, the mob flooded in and massacred his entire\nHousehold.”\n“Donnolian is dead?” Etzi breathed.\n“He is. The same thing has happened to two other Households, and\nmaybe more that I haven’t been able to get word to. A mob appeared\noutside my own gates a few hours ago, but I’d just been warned and my\nsoldiers were able to scatter the rabble. We grabbed this”—she shook the\npurge order—“off one of their leaders.”\nIt took Styke a few moments to catch up. “When you say that this is\nfrom Sedial…”\n“Written in his own hand and sent from Fatrasta,” Sika said. “He\nordered it weeks ago. I’ve wondered why his allies haven’t taken a stronger\nstance against Etzi’s legal wrangling, and this is why—because they knew\nthey’d get the order to kill us all anyway.” Sika’s voice dripped with fury.\n“The further chaos caused by these mobs is meant to screen their purge, to\nprevent us from uniting.”\nStyke took the purge order from Sika’s hand. He’d only just begun\nattempting to learn how to read and write Dynize, so the few paragraphs\nwere illegible to him. But the list of Household names that took up most of\nthe page was unmistakable. Styke spotted both Sika and Etzi’s names there,\nincluding a dozen other Households that he’d heard mentioned as in\nopposition of Sedial.\nEtzi staggered over to a nearby wall and sagged against it. Styke turned\nto Sika. “Why the purge order?” he asked. “Why not just send it through\none of his puppets?”\n“It’s the veneer of legality,” Sika sneered.\n“Why does that matter?” Styke asked. “He’s murdering Dynize\ncitizens.”\n“The Ka claims that he is purging enemies of the state. Anyone with a\nbrain can see he’s just consolidating his own power. But this list isn’t\neveryone, of course. There are over a hundred neutral Households.

An order\nwritten in his own hand is an official government act—those neutral\nHouseholds are less likely to defend us if they believe that they won’t be\nnext.”\n“And your emperor is just going to let this happen?”\n“That’s the worst part.” Etzi seemed to regain control of his senses,\nreturning to the center of the courtyard and presenting the envelope to\nStyke. “The signature at the bottom belongs to the emperor. He sanctioned\nthis.”\nStyke looked back and forth between the two Household heads. Sika\nwore a mask of anger, Etzi one of shock. But he could see the deep fear in\nthe eyes of both of them. He realized that he was looking into the faces of\ntwo people who already considered themselves as good as dead.\nThat’s why Sika wanted him to hear all of this. “You want my army,” he\nsaid flatly.\n“I haven’t spoken to more than a few Household heads,” Sika said\nquietly. “But the Great Ka has ordered our deaths. We can go quietly, or we\ncan go fighting.”\n“And you want to invite a foreign army into the city?” Etzi asked in\nhorror.\n“Damn the city!” Sika spat. “Damn Sedial, and damn the emperor! This\nis not just about individual honor or loyalty to a higher cause!” She\nsnatched the purge order from Styke’s hand and thrust it into Etzi’s face.\n“This orders the murder of our entire Households. Men, women, and\nchildren. If I thought my death would strengthen the empire, I would walk\nto it gladly. But I will not sacrifice the lives of thousands of people in my\ncare just to give that old sack of shit the control he craves. Don’t you dare\ntell me that you would, either.”\nA flurry of emotions crossed Etzi’s face, and in the course of a few\nmoments Styke saw him transform into the man who had ordered his\nsoldiers to cut their way through an angry mob. His jaw tightened and he\nnodded at Sika. “You’re right, I won’t. But we don’t stand a chance, divided\nas we are. Even if we ally ourselves with this cavalry force, we are still cut\noff from one another.”\n“I’m doing what I can,” Sika said, throwing her arms up. “You’re the\nthird Household that I’ve managed to warn. The best we can do right now is\nspread information—the more of us who are able to recall our soldiers from\nthe garrisons and close our gates, the more we may be able to weather these\nmobs. We get through the next few days and maybe we can rally our forces\nfaster than Sedial.”\nShe sounded confident, but Styke could tell she was clutching at straws.\nShe was right that Sedial’s allies were using the mobs to cover for their\npurge, but she couldn’t possibly believe that Etzi and the rest would be able\nto gather more strength than Sedial, even if they managed to survive the\ninitial bloodshed. Sedial had planned for this. His allies would have soldiers\nset aside to eventually put down the mobs and then crush any opposition\nthat remained. And with the Households spread out across the city…\n“We’re undefended,” Styke said."

They may not be back for hours.”\n“You damn well better hope that whoever is commanding the purge\ndoesn’t decide to get around to you until tomorrow,” Sika said, throwing up\nher hands. “I can’t spare anyone, I can’t risk…” She trailed off helplessly.\n“No need,” Etzi said confidently. “We have good walls. My soldiers will\nbe back within a few hours. We’ll be fine.”\n“You’re certain?”\n“Certain. You’re right. You can’t spare anyone, and you can’t stay here.\nYou have to warn as many of our allies as you can. I’ll send out a few\nrunners of my own.”\nStyke side-eyed Etzi. Sending out messengers would deplete the few\nguards they had left. He swore inwardly, willing the guardsmen to return\nwith his Lancers. Once they were back, he’d have options—defend Etzi,\nflee the city, or even escort Etzi’s entire Household to a bigger compound.\nHe tried to wrap his head around this new shift. He would use this civil\nstrife to his advantage, of course, but he had to figure out exactly how to do\nit.\nDid he go fetch Ibana and ride the army to the godstone, allowing the\nDynize to slaughter one another? Or did he intervene on behalf of Etzi? The\nformer was the smart thing to do. The latter was… the more honorable? The\nold Styke would have ridden away laughing. There was nothing better than\nan enemy at war with itself. But now?\nSika and her soldiers took some refreshment and ammunition, then\ndisappeared back into the city. Once she was gone, Styke cornered Etzi. “If\nyou can spare anyone—anyone—I need you to send them south with an\nupdate for my second-in-command. I’ll write her a message myself.”\n“It’ll be done.”\n“You also want to tell Ka-poel what’s going on,” he advised.\n“We may already be a lost cause, unless your men can come quickly\nenough,” Etzi responded.\n“I can’t promise that Ka-poel won’t think otherwise, but once your\nsoldiers bring mine back from the prison, I can get them armed and on\nhorseback. We can at least escort your Household to somewhere more\ndefensible.”\nEtzi passed a hand across his face. “I appreciate the offer, but there isn’t\nanywhere more defensible. We have to make a stand here.” He nodded to\nhimself. “I will go make my case to Ka-poel.”\nHe hadn’t been gone more than ten minutes when Styke heard a warning\nshout from one of the guards. He climbed quickly to one of the towers and\nlooked toward the city, where a mob had begun to gather at the end of the\ncauseway. It was already fifty strong and growing quickly. He could see city\nguardsmen among them, and even while he watched, an officer detached\nfrom the mob and walked the length of the causeway. He stopped a few\nyards from the gate."

He stopped a few\nyards from the gate.\n“I have an arrest warrant for Meln-Etzi!”\nEtzi was summoned and climbed up beside Styke. He was ashen-faced,\nbut steady. A single glance told Styke that Etzi knew exactly what this was.\n“I am Meln-Etzi,” he told the officer.\n“In the name of the emperor and the Great Ka, open this gate! You are\nunder arrest for treason!”\n“If I open this gate,” Etzi whispered, “we will all die.”\n“Agreed,” Styke said.\n“But if I don’t, they will storm the walls and destroy us anyway.” He\nfroze in place for several moments, then climbed down from the tower.\n“Meln-Etzi!” the officer called. “Meln-Etzi, I demand you open this\ngate.”\n“Keep it closed,” Etzi ordered. A small group had already begun to\ngather in the courtyard, and Etzi doled out tasks in a quick, efficient tone.\n“Maetle, get the youngest children and pregnant women into the smuggler\nhole. Send boats across the lake to our closest allies and tell them we need\nhelp. Open the armory for everyone else. We will try to stall for the return\nof our soldiers.”\nThe group scattered without questioning the orders. Within minutes\npeople began flooding back in, wearing old, ill-fitting breastplates and\nmorion helmets and carrying muskets from the Household armory. Styke\nwatched them impassively, considering getting his own weapons, when he\nspotted Celine and Jerio.\nJerio was carrying a musket. The boy could barely lift it, but he was\nlooking it over with the serious air of an experienced soldier. Styke could\nhear him arguing with Celine. “You are my guest,” Jerio said, mimicking\nwords that Styke had heard Etzi say on more than one occasion. “Join the\nchildren in the smuggler hole!”\n“I’ll man the walls,” Celine insisted, grabbing for Jerio’s musket. She\nput on a brave face, but Styke could see that the seriousness of the situation\nseemed to have struck her more deeply than it had Jerio. Her voice\ntrembled. She was breathing hard. She was terrified.\nSomething inside Styke snapped. His face twisted, his gut clenching. He\nstrode over to the arguing children and snatched the musket out of Jerio’s\nhands. “You’ll do no such thing,” he ordered. The idleness and suppressed\nfury of the last couple of weeks finally overwhelmed him. He could barely\nsee straight.\n“Ben!” Celine turned on him, her eyes tearing. “They’re going to kill my\nfriends, Ben. We can’t let them. I’ll fight, I will!”\nStyke grabbed them both by the shoulders and shoved them toward the\nstables. “No fighting. Take Jerio.”\n“I won’t hide!” Celine yelled.\n“Of course you won’t, you little shit. Jerio, I want you to load my\ncarbines. Celine.”\nHer tears were flowing freely now. “Ben?”\nStyke reached out and wiped a tear away with his thumb. “Go get my\narmor ready.”\nCHAPTER 61\nS"

Celine.”\nHer tears were flowing freely now. “Ben?”\nStyke reached out and wiped a tear away with his thumb. “Go get my\narmor ready.”\nCHAPTER 61\nS\ntyke ran a thumb along the base of his neck where enchanted steel\npressed against his bare skin, adjusting the thick wool shirt he wore as a\npadding to protect him from such chafing. He wasn’t just hot already—he\nwas boiling—but the sensation of his armor once again resting on his\nshoulders made him forget every other ill, discomfort, and pain. The weight\nof it felt protective and reassuring, but it was the scent of sorcery that made\nhis heart sing. That scent was just as potent as it was ten years ago. It\nswirled in his nostrils like the smell of a bitter beer.\nOne of the greatest dangers a soldier could face was the feeling of his\nown invincibility. It was a particular kind of stupidity that could get anyone\nkilled. Styke had danced with such a feeling his whole life, but the armor?\nThe armor removed that blind spot. It made him a walking fortress, with\nfew weaknesses.\nHe stepped forward and finished adjusting Amrec’s armor. The big\nwarhorse shimmied and shook his head in protest at the weight of the\ndraping chain mail, but Styke took him by the nose and whispered in his ear\nuntil he calmed. “You’re fine, you big baby. We tried this on you back at\nStarlight. You can do this.” He ran his hand along Amrec’s flank, feeling for\nuncomfortable wrinkles in the chain. He could hear shouting just outside\nthe stables. The mob was growing impatient, threatening to batter down the\ngate of the Etzi compound.\n“How do I look?” Styke asked, presenting himself to his small audience.\nCeline looked him up and down seriously. “Like a knight.”\nJerio seemed more skeptical. He could hear the sounds outside and they\nwere clearly getting to him. “You’re sure it works?”\nStyke breathed in that bitter draft of sorcery. “It works.”\n“My uncle is a captain. He says that armor, even enchanted armor, is no\nmatch for a good musket ball.”\nStyke reached up and grasped Amrec’s saddle horn, put a foot in the\nstirrup, and pulled himself onto the warhorse. “Normally, I’d agree with\nhim. But in this case…” He patted Amrec on the neck and nodded to the\nstable door. Celine ran to open it, but she was beaten by the door sliding\nopen on its own.\n“Ben, are you…” It was Etzi. The Household head froze at the sight of\nStyke, looking up with widening eyes. “What are you doing?”\n“I’m going to disperse the mob.”\nEtzi scoffed in disbelief, then ran forward to take Amrec by the bridle.\nAmrec snorted and stomped at the gesture, and Etzi took a step back.\n“That’s not just a mob. They have muskets and pikes. Real weapons.\nWhatever you think you can do with a set of enchanted armor, it’s not\nenough. There are well over a hundred now. They’ll pull you down and kill\nyou.” He took a deep breath and set his jaw. “I’m going to offer myself"

I’m hoping that’s enough to buy the rest of you\nsome time.”\nStyke scratched at his neck. The wool shirt was slipping again. Even\nafter months of freedom he still weighed two stone less than he had the last\ntime he wore this armor. It wasn’t dangerously loose, but it was\nuncomfortably so. “Move,” he told Etzi.\nReluctantly, the Household head stepped aside. Styke gestured to Celine,\nwho rushed to the corner of the stables and snatched up his helmet and\nlance. He took the helmet first, fitting it onto his head, enjoying the\nprotective claustrophobia that still smelled of his decade-old sweat. He took\nhis lance, ducked his head, and rode out of the stables.\nA hodgepodge of Household members had gathered in the courtyard.\nThey jumped out of the way as Styke entered their midst, staring. He\nwondered what was going through their heads and remembered the old\ndays. Back in Landfall, the first few times the Lancers had worn their armor\nin public, everyone had thought them mad, imbeciles, fools clad in ancient\nvestments. It wasn’t until they’d won battle after battle that they’d begun to\nchant when they entered a town.\n“Open the gate,” Styke ordered.\nNo one moved. A rock sailed over their heads and clattered against the\nwall of one of the buildings inside the compound. Another breached the\ncompound gate, then another. A window shattered. Styke could see the fear\non the faces of the Household members. Old women, young boys, invalids.\nAll of them holding old muskets from the Household armory, all of them\nwaiting for death to come streaming through that gate.\nHe wondered where his own fear lay. Etzi was right, of course. One\nman, even in enchanted armor, couldn’t hold off an angry mob. The\nmoment he slowed down, they would pull him from Amrec’s back and find\nthe chinks in his armor. Riding through that door might as well be a death\nsentence.\nFear, he decided, didn’t factor into it. These people had hosted and\nprotected him. They’d taken in Ka-poel and Celine. They’d treated him like\none of their own. Now, with the mob banging at their door, they couldn’t\nhope to protect themselves. But he could protect them. He could be their\nshield, buy them time until Etzi’s guard returned with his Lancers. He was\nBen Styke and, he decided, it was about time this goddamn continent\nlearned what that meant.\nHe lowered his visor. “Open the gate!” he bellowed.\nCeline and Jerio appeared, rushing through the courtyard and throwing\nthemselves at the mighty bar that kept the door locked. They were too\nsmall, even together, to make it budge. Etzi arrived at their heels and put his\nback beneath the bar, snapping his Household members out of their fearful\nreverie.

The bar was lifted, the heavy doors pulled back.\nThe first unlucky bastard to surge through the gate caught Amrec’s front\nhooves to the chest, hurling his body into the bottlenecked crowd with\nenough force to dash a half dozen of them to the ground. The mob arrested\nits own forward momentum, causing several of them to fall off the sides of\nthe causeway into the lake. Those closest to Styke scrambled backward, the\nheat of their fury dissipating at the point of Styke’s lance and the spark of\nAmrec’s hooves on the flagstones.\nStyke advanced until Amrec was entirely on the causeway. He was\nsurrounded now, though all those closest cowered in surprise at his advance.\n“Close the gates!” he called over his shoulder. He heard them creak closed\nbehind him, then the boom of the bar being put back into place. He inhaled\ndeeply, smelling the sorcery and sweat and fear and anger. He should be\nshivering in nervous anticipation, but instead he found a laugh rumbling up\nfrom his belly.\nThis was what he was made for.\n“Who’s in charge of this?” he demanded in Dynize.\nThe mob continued to claw a slow retreat, those in the front trying to\nmove backward and those behind shoving forward. That retreat slowed to\nnothing when the weight of their more adventurous comrades kept them\nfrom being able to slip back farther.\n“It’s the foreign giant!” someone shouted.\n“Give us Etzi,” another whooped.\nStyke swung his lance across the noses of the closest of the mob. “You\ndon’t want Etzi. You want me.”\n“He’s a traitor!”\n“Forget Etzi, this is the foreigner! Pull him from his horse!”\n“You pull him from his horse,” a young woman just out of reach of\nStyke’s lance called over her shoulder. She turned and leapt into the water.\nA few others joined her. The rest of the mob held strong. Styke could feel\nthem growing a backbone, realizing that this was just one man in some\narmor. He could hear whispered encouragement from the center of things,\nno doubt coming from Sedial’s paid instigators. He tried to find anyone who\nlooked like they held some sort of authority. He failed.\nAmrec could feel it, too—that growing tension. Styke tightened his grip\non his lance.\nHe saw a movement among the crowd. A young man lifted a musket,\nbraced it on the shoulder of a comrade, and pulled the trigger. Styke saw the\npuff of smoke, heard the noise of the blast, and felt a ping against the visor\nof his helmet that jerked his head backward, all in a fraction of a second.\nThere was a shocked silence. Styke reached, left-handed, across his\nsaddle and drew his carbine. He leveled it and pulled the trigger, dropping\nthe shooter in a spray of blood.\nAll pit broke loose.\nThe mob surged forward with a howl. Styke holstered his carbine in one\nsmooth motion, took the reins in one hand, and dug in his heels. Amrec\nleapt into the crowd without hesitation.

Styke’s lance tore the face off an old man\nthrowing a rock, punched through shoulders and stomachs, quickly\nbecoming too heavy to hold. He released the lance with a grunt, drawing his\nsaber and laying about him. Bullets, pikes, rocks, and clubs all bounced off\nhis armor. The cacophony of it was deafening, a bludgeoning that might\nhave unhorsed a lesser man on a lesser horse.\nHe began to laugh, the mirth bubbling up from his stomach. It didn’t\ntake long for him to reach the end of the causeway and gain the main\navenue. Amrec’s momentum slowed as they rode into an even greater\ncrowd. The avenue was packed, the mob here thick and angry. They\nswarmed like angry hornets, those with long weapons dashing forward to\nattempt to thrust them between Amrec’s legs, others leaping out of the way.\nStyke turned Amrec and drove him back to the causeway, clearing it\ncompletely in one swoop and then turning to ride back toward the city,\nplowing into the center of the mob. No one who could still stand remained\nin the causeway. The Household was safe. The entire fury of the mob was\nupon him.\nAmrec danced through the furious crowd, hooves flashing tirelessly\nwhile Styke’s saber rose and fell. He fought with one eye on the causeway,\nanother on the mob, waiting for them to break.\nBut they didn’t break. Organized city guard members, fighting as a unit,\nemerged from the mob. They gave up trying to shoot him and fixed their\nshort plug bayonets. More pikes emerged, as if brought to them by\nauxiliaries hiding in the alleys. They began to rush Styke in determined\nwaves, falling back from his mad flailing and then trying again.\nStyke lost all concept of time. He felt himself begin to grow sluggish as\nhe continued to fight, losing strength behind the swing of his saber. He\ncould feel Amrec’s exhaustion between his legs.\nHe heard Amrec’s scream a moment before the horse lurched beneath\nhim and fell. They both went down in a tumble, and only long-practiced\ninstinct allowed Styke to throw himself free instead of being pinned beneath\nAmrec’s weight. He rolled, losing his saber but drawing his knife, coming\nup unsteadily and turning his head toward his horse.\nAmrec tried to regain his feet. Screamed again. The sound wrenched\nsomething inside of Styke, tearing out his guts as he watched Amrec fail,\nand try and fail again.\nThe distraction cost him. Styke felt a scrape against his armor and then a\nsting at his side. He whirled hard, only to find a Dynize face clinging close\nto him. It belonged to a middle-aged woman, who snarled through his visor.\n“From the Great Ka,” she hissed. Styke gasped as her knife was pulled from\nhis side, raised, bloody and dripping, and thrust toward his eyes. He barely\nregistered the stark white bone of the knife, the black tattoos that spiraled\nup the woman’s arm.\nHe only heard his horse screaming."

He barely\nregistered the stark white bone of the knife, the black tattoos that spiraled\nup the woman’s arm.\nHe only heard his horse screaming.\nHe slammed his head against her face, listening to the rasp of her blade\nsliding harmlessly along his visor. Blood sprayed from the impact,\nmomentarily blinding him, but he had a hold of her with his left hand now\nand didn’t need his sight. He felt the tip of his knife drag at her swamp-\ndragon-leather armor. Giving a roar, he punched it through with all his\nstrength.\nThe dragonman sagged in his arms and he threw the disemboweled\ncorpse into the crowd, then wrenched off his helmet so that he could clean\nthe blood from his eyes. What he saw when his vision cleared was like\nsomething out of a nightmare.\nSoldiers swarmed Amrec, trying to put down the screaming, flailing\nhorse with their long pikes. More dashed toward Styke, while those closest\nto him stared at the body of their dragonman in shock. “Dogs!” he spat.\n“Cowards! Can’t even put down a horse!” He steadied himself, his fury\nthreatening to burst from his chest. Something caught the attention of\nseveral of the city guard, turning their heads. Styke took the opportunity to\nrock onto the balls of his feet and fling himself forward.\nHe crashed into them with reckless abandon. He thrust his knife with\none hand and wielded his helmet like a club with the other. Within moments\nboth gauntlets were soaked in blood. Guardsmen fell beneath him like bugs,\ntheir screaming and pleading falling on deaf ears.\nHe lost his helmet, turned, and snatched a man by the front of his shirt\nand drew his knife hand back.\n“Ben!” the man wailed. “It’s me!”\nThe blow almost fell. Styke yanked himself from his bloodlust, eyes\nfocusing until he recognized Markus clutched in his outstretched arm. He\nforced himself to let go, to lower his knife and look around. What he saw\nastounded him—armored figures riding down the Dynize mob, swarming\naround Styke at a charge. What remained of the city guard attempted to flee,\nonly to run into the fixed bayonets of Etzi’s Household guard marching up\nthe avenue.\nHe stumbled back from Markus, taking deep breaths. One of the\narmored cavalry came to a stop in front of him, wrenching off her helmet. It\nwas Ibana, and she barely paused to look at him before barking orders.\n“Secure that alley! Don’t let them get away! Leave a few alive for\nquestioning! Gut the rest!” Her horse stamped and thundered beneath her,\nand Styke noticed distantly that the neck and forelegs of the beast were\nsplattered in the blood of run-down enemies. He took a shaky breath.\n“How did you find me?”\n“Jackal’s spirits warned us you’d gotten yourself into a situation,” she\nsaid, her eyes still on the ensuing slaughter. “Looks like we arrived just in\ntime.”\nStyke could no longer feel that joy of the battle.

        "text": "time.”\nStyke could no longer feel that joy of the battle. In its place was a\nhollow, distant grief. His gaze returned to Amrec, who now lay on his side,\nstill but breathing. Styke could see now that one of Amrec’s hooves was\nhanging by a sinew. The mad beast had tried to stand, even with a leg nearly\ncut off.\n“No, you were too late,” Styke told Ibana. “Give me your carbine.”\nCHAPTER 62\nF\nor the second time in his life, Michel watched as Landfall burned.\nThe first time had been during the revolution. Fatrastan partisans and\nKez soldiers had fought back and forth across the plateau while Ben Styke’s\nMad Lancers barely kept the Kez fleet from landing reinforcements along\nthe rocky shores. Lady Chancellor Lindet’s armies had arrived in the nick of\ntime, finally capturing Fort Nied and pushing the Kez into the ocean. This\ntime, he saw no Mad Lancers in their gleaming armor. He saw no rescuing\narmy.\nMichel hid in a church bell tower and watched while frustrated Dynize\nsoldiers raged back and forth across the plateau, continuing their slow and\nbrutal suppression of the Palo rioters. Smoke rose from a dozen quarters,\nincluding Greenfire Depths. But the Depths was still there. It hadn’t been\ndestroyed by Privileged, and no new Privileged had been sent to finish the\njob.\nIt had been two days since he lost Ichtracia and his heart still hurt. He’d\nbeen unable to find so much as a body—hers, or the Privileged she’d been\nfighting. He’d spent his time since dodging patrols, trying to find some kind\nof organization among the rioters, and looking for Jiniel. Mama Palo’s\nheadquarters was abandoned and refugees streamed out of the city by the\nthousands. If the Dynize cared about those that were fleeing, they made no\nmove to stop them. The city had all their attention.\nDespite the inevitable end to the uprising, hundreds of Palo fought on\nbehind barricades or engaged the Dynize in long, running battles. Michel\nwatched as they were snuffed out one at a time, and scoured the city for any\nsign of his allies. The church bell tower was one of his preordained meeting\nspots, and the ninth such spot that he’d checked. Yet there was still no sign\nof Jiniel or the others.\nMichel saw a Dynize patrol gun down a lone stone-throwing Palo boy\nand averted his eyes. He’d expected violence at some point, but all of this?\nThis was too much. This was not what he’d wanted. And yet he was\nresponsible. He gathered up his pack of meager belongings scrounged from\nMama Palo’s headquarters and headed down from the bell tower, making\nhis way across the empty church and standing by the door for a few minutes\nto listen for a break in the fighting outside.\n“Michel!” The name was barked sharply, and it made him jump and\nspin. Across the room, back behind the altar, he spotted a familiar face,\nwhich brought a sigh of relief. It was Devin-Mezi, Jiniel’s cousin. Michel\nput a hand over his heart and gave her a nod.

She rushed across the room to\nhim. “Pit and damnation, it is you. We thought we’d lost you.”\n“Not yet,” Michel answered. “I’ve been looking for you as well. Where\nis Jiniel?”\n“We retreated to the catacombs,” Devin-Mezi said, looking Michel over\nwith a scowl. “We’re hiding with Yaret and his Household.”\nMichel nodded tiredly. “That makes sense. I lost my maps and I didn’t\nreally want to get lost down there looking for you.”\n“We have the maps,” Devin-Mezi said reassuringly. “We got most of our\npeople out of… well, never mind. I’ll take you to Jiniel, she’ll want to\nupdate you.” Her scowl deepened. “Are you hurt?”\nMichel instinctively hid his left hand. The wound had opened badly\nduring the explosion that had ended Ichtracia’s fight with the Privileged,\nand he hadn’t been able to stop it from weeping blood since. A hasty, one-\nhanded stitch job was all that was keeping it together. It hurt so badly that\nhe could barely see, but he forced himself to think through it. He gave\nDevin-Mezi a tight grin. “Where’s the closest entrance to the catacombs?”\nThey were able to make their way through the street fighting and\ndescended into the plateau through the basement of a bakery. Devin-Mezi\nproduced a hidden lantern and two pistols, one of which she handed to\nMichel. “Just in case,” she told him. “Some of the soldiers have been\nventuring down here, but they rarely bother going very far for fear of\ngetting lost.”\nMichel was too tired to harbor suspicions or fears. He followed Devin-\nMezi through the maze of tunnels, descending deeper and deeper until they\nrounded a corner and suddenly spotted a pool of light. It was a sentry, a\nPalo who challenged them and stood aside when Devin-Mezi gave the\npassword. Soon they were past, and descended still farther until they broke\nout into a number of large chambers well lit by oil lanterns and crowded\nwith people, both Palo and Dynize.\nMichel allowed himself to feel pain again at the sight of familiar faces,\nbut forced himself to keep walking rather than collapse into a sobbing mess.\nDevin-Mezi continued to lead him through the group until they stopped\noutside of a chamber cordoned off by a cloak stretched across a string. She\nswept it aside. “I found him!”\nMichel stumbled in after her and was mobbed by relieved faces, thumps\non his back, whispered questions, and a jumble of news. He waved it all\nback, blinking through his pain, and collapsed into an offered chair before\nlooking across the gathering. It consisted of Jiniel and several of her\nlieutenants, Yaret, Tenik, and a handful of Yaret Household cupbearers.\n“By Kresimir,” Jiniel swore. “Michel, you are covered in blood.”\n“I need whiskey, a needle, thread, and someone with a steady hand,” he\nanswered.\nJiniel barked orders, and within minutes the supplies were brought.

        "text": "“I need whiskey, a needle, thread, and someone with a steady hand,” he\nanswered.\nJiniel barked orders, and within minutes the supplies were brought. It\nwas Tenik who knelt beside Michel with the needle and thread, taking a\ndamp cloth to wash Michel’s hand. Michel grimaced at every touch, but\nseveral swallows of whiskey took the edge off and allowed him to consider\nthe faces before him with a little more clarity. He focused on Jiniel and\npointed toward the rock above their heads.\n“Have you been outside lately?”\nShe nodded. “We have word coming in from our people at a constant\nrate. All the coming and going is risky, but we’re trying to stay on top of\neverything happening.”\n“Our people are getting slaughtered out there.”\nJiniel cast her eyes downward. “I know.”\nAnd there was nothing she could do. There was nothing any of them\ncould do. Michel stared at his hand, trying to make himself think. They\nneeded a plan, no matter how simple or cowardly. Run away. Fight back.\nHe could barely summon the energy to move, let alone make that decision.\nHe took another swig of whiskey and thought about Ichtracia striding to her\ndeath to face down three Privileged. She would have won, too, if not for the\nfourth showing up. He winced as Tenik finished cleaning his hand and\nbegan to pick out the sloppy stitches he’d done himself.\n“Do we have any plans?” Michel asked.\n“We’re working on it,” Jiniel replied, exchanging a glance with Yaret.\nThe Household head cleared his throat. “We’ve coordinated with some of\nthe larger groups of fighters, and spread evacuation orders to as many\ncommunities as we can.”\nYaret spoke up. “We just received word from Etepali. She’s stuck up\nnorth between two of Sedial’s armies and Lady Flint. She doesn’t think she\ncan slip away, but offers us succor if we can reach her.”\nRunning away seemed like a really good idea right now. But how to get\nout of the city? “You should make a run for it,” he told Yaret. “Right now,\nwith all Sedial’s focus on Lindet’s armies and putting down the Palo.”\n“We’re considering the idea,” Yaret said seriously.\n“Good.” Michel turned his gaze on Jiniel, who grimaced at his hand\nuntil she noticed him watching her and tried to turn it into a smile.\n“You and Ichtracia saved Greenfire Depths,” she said. “I’m guessing the\nsorcerous fight on the Rim was the two of you.”\n“Just her,” he said with a sad smile, shaking his head. Beside him, Tenik\nfinally began to stitch his hand. He barely felt the in and out of the needle\nthrough his gloom.\n“People are fleeing the Depths in droves,” Jiniel continued. “No one is\nstopping them, and Sedial hasn’t sent any more Privileged to start fires.”\n“I noticed that.” Michel took a long look as Tenik continued the stitches\non his ruined hand. “I couldn’t even find a body.”\nJiniel and Yaret looked at each other again. “Whose body?” Jiniel asked.\n“Ichtracia’s.”\n“But… she’s still alive,” Yaret said."

No one could have survived that.”\nYaret did not shrink before his temper. “One of my cupbearers saw her\nafter the battle. Sedial’s people captured her. She was beaten up, but still\nalive.” He leaned toward Michel. “The People-Eater doesn’t die so easily.”\nSomething flared in Michel’s belly, stirring upward through his chest\nuntil it reached his mind. He could feel the gears there begin to grind. He\nsought to grasp onto that flicker of energy, to use it to pull himself from his\nsleep-deprived, painful lethargy. If Ichtracia had survived that fight, she\nwould be in dire straits now. Sedial might punish her in some way. Pit, he\nmight still have need of her blood. The very thought of her as a sacrifice\nmade Michel retch. Something had to be done. But what? It would take the\nbiggest army in the world to rescue her from Sedial—or the best spy. He\nwasn’t the latter on the best of days, let alone in his current condition, and\nhe didn’t have the former.\n“Where is Sedial?” Michel asked.\n“We have contact with some sympathetic Households still near the\ncapital building,” Yaret said slowly. “They said that Sedial has retreated to\nthe fortress down south.”\n“To use the stones?” Michel asked sharply.\n“Or just to wait out the violence,” Yaret said with a shrug.\nThere was the rustle of a soft voice outside the meeting chamber, and\nTenik finished tying off Michel’s stitches and climbed painfully to his feet\nto cross to the makeshift door. He spoke to someone on the other side, then\nturned to Yaret. “We have more information coming in from the plateau.”\n“Go on,” Yaret urged.\n“Sedial is gathering his troops, pulling them out of Upper Landfall.”\n“He’s regrouping?” Michel guessed.\nTenik spoke to the messenger outside in a low voice before turning back\nto them. “We’re not entirely sure. It seems he’s massing troops on the\nsouthern bank of the Hadshaw. At least twenty thousand of them already.”\n“Twenty thousand,” Michel breathed in disbelief.\n“And rising. He’s pulled everyone off the plateau. They just left in the\nmiddle of firefights and melees.”\n“He must be preparing for a new push into the city.” Michel looked\naround at the faces of his friends, trying to make some sense of this.\n“But why abandon good positions to do it?” Yaret asked.\nNo one seemed to know the answer. “Send out more people,” Michel\ntold Jiniel. “Even if our risk of being discovered goes up. We have to know\nwhat’s going on.” He was already considering courses of action, trying to\ncome up with any idea, no matter how far-fetched, that would allow him to\nrescue Ichtracia.

The fear that Ichtracia was about to be used as another\nblood sacrifice continued to grow. He kept it to himself. No need to spark a\npanic until they had a better plan. “How about your allies?” he asked Yaret.\n“Is there a staunch resistance against Sedial yet?”\n“I’ve warned everyone on the purge list,” Yaret replied, spreading his\nhands. “Seven of them are already dead. Several more have fled the city. A\nfew have managed to withdraw all their troops and plan to make a stand,\nand the rest… well, the rest are hunkering down to wait out the violence,\nhoping that Sedial changes his mind. The damned fools. It would take an\nact of a god to get them to act, even on the eve of their own destruction.”\n“So no help from that quarter?”\n“Maybe a small amount.”\n“The ones who plan on fighting back. Can you try to unite them?”\nIt was Tenik who answered. “We’ve been trying to do just that. It’s\ngoing… all right. If we had two more weeks to work, we might be able to\ngather all of Sedial’s enemies.”\nMichel sought a solution—any solution—and came up empty-handed. A\ncommotion outside took Tenik back to the door, where he conferred with a\nnew voice. There was an excited, quiet exchange and Tenik whirled on the\nroom. “We know why Sedial is massing his troops!”\n“Why?” Michel climbed to his feet, followed by everyone else in the\nroom.\nTenik scoffed, double-checked with the messenger, then shook his head\nin disbelief. “We’ve spotted a flotilla. There are hundreds of keelboats\ncoming down the Hadshaw. They’re within miles of the city.”\n“Lindet?” Michel asked in confusion.\n“No. It’s Lady Flint and the Adrans.”\nA handful of gasps escaped the gathered lieutenants, and Yaret stared at\nTenik. “How is that possible? We just heard from Etepali today and she said\nthe Adrans were a five-day march north.”\n“It’s the flotilla,” Michel explained excitedly, already limping for the\ndoor. “With enough keelboats, Flint could bring everyone she has down the\nriver in less than half the time it takes to march it. Try to organize the Palo\non the plateau,” he told Jiniel. “Put out fires and give us a semblance of\norder. Yaret, see if you can gather some of your allies during this respite.”\n“Where are you going?” Jiniel asked.\n“If I’m going to get Ichtracia back, I’ll need an army. And Lady Flint\nhas the best one on the continent.”\nCHAPTER 63\nV\nlora stood on the prow of her keelboat, face to the wind, listening to the\npolers keep time as they worked their way up and down the sides of the\nvessel.

She could feel the tension of the\nmoment, her heart hammering at the prospect of the coming battle.\nA light powder trance hummed in the back of her head, keeping her\nthoughts clear and her body limber. She didn’t trust herself to take more\nthan the smallest amount of powder, but this, she told herself, would be\nenough. As she scanned the horizon with her looking glass, she picked out\nthe most important features in the landscape.\nThe largest was the Landfall Plateau, looming less than two miles from\ntheir current position and growing closer with every moment. Smoke rose\nfrom the city, telling a tale of internal strife, while people streamed out of\nthe suburbs of Lower Landfall at an alarming rate. She put the refugees\nfrom her mind. They would not be a threat.\nThe threat, she found, was gathering on a bend in the river, just where\nthe Hadshaw turned toward the ocean and the western bank became the\nsouthern bank. Thousands of soldiers—tens of thousands—mustered\nspeedily on the plain. Their morion helmets and steel breastplates glittered\nin the afternoon sun as their officers tried to force them into formation.\nThousands more streamed from the city, the suburbs, and from the mighty\nfortress half-constructed around the godstone south of the city.\n“Looks like they knew we were coming,” Bo said. He stood beside her,\nhis own looking glass to his eye, gloves already donned. “Their scouts must\nbe lightning fast.”\n“Or one of the armies we were facing up north sent their fastest\nmessengers once we’d slipped away,” Vlora replied. “They would have\nkilled a horse to get here before us, but it is possible.”\n“Either way,” Bo mused, “we’re in for a fight.”\n“As expected. Do you see that bit of high ground at seven o’clock?”\n“No… wait, yes. They’re putting a couple of field guns into place.”\n“Looks like it.” Vlora lowered her looking glass and turned to look back\nacross the flotilla just in time to see another keelboat maneuver perilously\nclose to hers. The polers on both vessels stopped their work as the two\ndrifted together, and then Olem leapt onto hers. Once he was on board, the\npolers immediately began to move again. He brushed off the front of his\nuniform, gained his balance, and came to join her with a flushed face.\n“I’ve leapt between horses before,” he proclaimed, “but there’s\nsomething about jumping keelboats that’s even more terrifying. I’ve got\nnews from the shore.”\n“Our cavalry?” Vlora asked.\n“They’re pretty exhausted from the ride down here,” Olem reported.\n“Sabastenien says that he’d prefer not to use them unless absolutely\nnecessary. He has been able to scout with spare horses.”\n“And?”\n“We’re looking at twenty-five thousand infantry, with the number rising\nquickly as they get reinforcements. They’ve got one heavy-gun\nemplacement up on the plateau, but it’s not facing the river—it’s facing\nwest.

Vlora thought she saw a splash some ways down the\nriver. The report of a single artillery round hit them a moment later.\n“Getting their distance,” she commented. “Anything else?”\n“Yes. That fortress down south might not be finished, but it has some\npretty nasty gun towers and sloped walls. If we do manage to take the field,\nthat damned fortress is gonna be a whole different beast.”\n“We’ll deal with that when we get to it,” Vlora said. “Tell Sabastenien\nthat I want his cavalry to harass the enemy’s north flank. Tell him not to\nengage—just keep them nervous. I want Davd and Buden to keep those gun\ncrews hopping until we can get close enough for Nila to take care of them.\nNorrine is on Privileged duty. Bo is going to do his best to keep us from\ngetting hit too hard in the face when we land.”\n“Right away!” Olem signaled to a nearby keelboat and was soon leaping\nacross, off to deliver Vlora’s orders.\nShe took several deep breaths, willing herself steady, and glanced over\nat Bo. He was watching her with a note of concern. “What?”\n“You ready for this?”\nVlora reached into her pocket for a powder charge, squeezing one end\nbetween two fingers until a few granules spilled out into her palm. With a\nthought, she ignited them, causing a small flash and wisp of smoke.\nBo raised both eyebrows. “I’ll be damned.”\n“It’s coming back,” Vlora told him. “Not fast enough, and I’m not going\nto push myself, but it’s there.”\n“Congratulations. Just promise me you won’t do anything too stupid\ntoday.”\n“I’ll try.”\n“I’m not reassured.”\nThey continued down the river, the probing shots of shore artillery\ngetting closer and closer as the flotilla approached. Small clusters of enemy\ntroops began to appear on the bank, streaming in from some nearby camp.\nVlora could tell at a glance that the troops were green, their officers\nstruggling to keep them in order. She wondered if they would be the worst\nshe faced, but immediately dismissed the thought. Sedial was too intelligent\nnot to surround himself with at least a few brigades of veterans. He’d throw\nthese greenhorns at her to tire her out, then unleash the veterans.\nOlem returned. “Messages sent,” he reported. “I’ll be relieved when we\nget back on shore and I don’t have to do that.”\n“Man up,” Vlora told him playfully.\nHe scoffed, taking an offered rifle from one of Vlora’s bodyguard and\nreadjusting his bicorn hat. “I’ve never done a proper water landing before.”\n“It might get rough,” Bo warned, raising his hands as a cannonball\nsplashed down just a few hundred paces in front of them.\nVlora peered toward the shore, watching as the groups of soldiers grew"

Their landing point was in the gentle shallows\njust at the bend of the river, and the enemy had clearly anticipated the spot.\nAt least two brigades would oppose them there. She had more men, of\ncourse, but she was also leading them off several hundred keelboats.\n“Rough” might be an understatement.\n“Oh,” Bo suddenly said. “I brought you something.” He fished into his\npocket quickly and, before she could object, threw something over her\nneck. It was a red-and-blue-striped sash with a gold medallion stamped with\nthe mountains of Adro over the teardrop of the Adsea. It took her a moment\nto recognize it, and when she did, she let out a gasp. The last time she’d\nseen this medallion was when it had been worn by Tamas to some state\nfunction. Though it had been his by right, he rarely wore it and never kept it\ndisplayed.\nIt was the decoration of a field marshal of Adro.\n“This doesn’t belong on me,” she said in confusion, trying to take it off.\nOlem reached out and stopped her.\nBo said, “Remember when you accused me of bringing Taniel an army\nand then handing it to you when he didn’t want it? Well, the army was\nnever meant for Taniel. It was meant for you. Whether you like it or not,\nyou’re Field Marshal Flint now. The general staff voted on it yesterday.\nUnanimous. So keep the bloody thing on.”\nVlora didn’t know how to respond. She fingered the gold medallion, lost\nin memories for a brief moment until the report of cannon fire brought her\nback to the present. She drew her sword and turned around. To her surprise,\nhundreds of sets of eyes were already on her. The men crouched on their\nkeelboats, bayonets fixed, rifles loaded. An eerie silence had fallen over the\nflotilla.\n“My soldiers!” she called, loud and clear. “My friends! Today we do not\nfight for glory or riches. We do not fight for the immediate safety of our\npeople or our borders. We fight a menace that we alone among modern men\nhave faced before. Today we aim our weapons at a man who would be a\ngod. Are you with me?” Thousands of men sprang to their feet, lifting rifles\nin the air, and let out a great cheer. “We will not allow this threat to rise!”\nshe bellowed. “We will spit in the face of those who would rule the world!”\nVlora whirled, her sword thrust into the air. Ahead of her, the sandy\nriverbank loomed large as the keelboats turned toward it, rather than\ncontinuing on with the curve of the river. A cannonball suddenly whizzed\npast her head, tearing into a keelboat behind her and scattering dozens of\nsoldiers. Their cheers did not die down—they only intensified.\nBo suddenly threw up his hands, fingers twitching. The air above them\nseemed to shatter and a cannonball careened off his sorcery, flying"

The air above them\nseemed to shatter and a cannonball careened off his sorcery, flying\nharmlessly toward the opposite bank. He grimaced, then his eyes widened.\n“Hold on!” he yelled, bracing himself against something only he could see.\nVlora felt the sorcery a half second before it collided with Bo’s shield.\nLightning webbed above them, crackling and hissing. A bolt of ice\nmaterialized over Bo’s shoulder and lanced toward the bank. “Got him!” Bo\ncrowed. “Norrine, you better hurry up if you want to kill those assholes\nbefore me! Nila, now!”\nThe moment Nila’s name left Bo’s lips, a column of blue fire sprouted\nfrom the keelboat to their right. The flames sizzled across the water, hitting\nthe bank and turning as if they had a mind of their own. They cascaded\nacross the bank, consuming infantrymen by the hundreds. Within seconds\nthere was nothing but charred flesh and blackened grass on the riverbank,\nleaving Vlora with a beachhead several hundred yards deep and twice as\nwide. She braced herself as the polers suddenly dug in, slowing the boat\nuntil they slid almost gently onto the sandbar.\nVlora licked a few morsels of powder off her fingertips and drew her\npistol, waving both pistol and sword in the air. “Charge!” she cried, leaping\ninto the knee-deep water. Ten thousand voices answered her call, and the\nmight of the Adran Army swarmed the shore.\nVlora’s soldiers gained their beachhead and then some. Within thirty\nminutes the entire riverbank was theirs. Three Dynize gun emplacements\nlay in smoldering ruins thanks to Nila’s sorcery. Marion-helmed Dynize\ncasualties littered the field and filled it with the cries of the wounded. The\nrest of the Dynize had pulled back with startling alacrity—half fleeing, half\nretreating, but keeping the bulk of their army between Vlora and the\ngodstone. The rest of the keelboats were unloaded, field guns rolled by\nplank onto the soft floodplains while Sabastenien’s cavalry kept the Dynize\nnervous to the west.\nDuring the landing, Vlora had twisted her ankle in the run toward shore.\nIt was an undignified injury, and she paced to try and work out the pain. A\nbullet had grazed Olem’s cheek, leaving him with a startling amount of\nblood across his chin and collar. Bo cleaned sand out of his prosthetic,\nwhile Nila had somehow managed to reach the shore without getting even\nthe hem of her dress wet. Vlora ordered Burt’s irregulars up to relieve the\ncavalry, and gazed toward the plateau, where she could just barely see the\ngun platform that would make her life miserable if she tried to march\ntoward the godstone.\n“I don’t like it,” she stated to no one in particular.\n“Like what?” Olem asked, dabbing at his cheek with a handkerchief. He\nwaved off a surgeon and walked over to join Vlora.\n“They should have held us there,” she replied. “They had enough men"

Our scouts estimate they now have thirty-\nfive thousand soldiers on the field between us and the godstone and still\ngrowing. So why are they holding off?”\nVlora brooded, staring toward the monolith she could see clearly just a\ncouple miles to their south. It poked up from the center of that big, ugly\nfortress. She could once again sense that dark foreboding from the\ngodstone, putting her on edge, and she worried that it might affect her\ndecision-making. “They might be stretched thin. The sorcerers, I mean.\nWith Lindet to the west and a couple armies still up north and the losses we\ninflicted on their cabal during the siege of Landfall, they might just not be\nable to field very much sorcery against us, so they plan on a defensive\nbattle.”\n“Possibly,” Olem conceded.\nThere was a “but” in his tone. “What do you think it could be?”\n“If he knew we were coming, what if he’s just luring us toward the\nfortress? Does the godstone have any other powers that we’re not aware\nof?”\nThe very suggestion made Vlora ill. “Ask Nila and Bo. Tell them to be\nready for anything.” She couldn’t allow herself to hope that they’d\ncompletely caught Ka-Sedial with his pants down. But if she had, and there\nwas a chance to avoid the coming bloodshed… “Get me a messenger to\nsend to Ka-Sedial. He has thirty minutes to agree to surrender the godstone,\nor we’re going to take it by force.”\n“Isn’t that Delia’s job?” Olem asked.\n“Do you see Delia anywhere? Besides, we still don’t know for sure\nwhether she’s betrayed us or not.” The orders were relayed, and Vlora\nwatched the messenger run off to find a political officer, then turned her\nattention back to the landing. Her soldiers were already falling into line,\nforming tight regiments with her best troops—some of them still wearing\ntheir Riflejack mercenary uniforms—composing the center. Auxiliaries\ncommanded the right, while a staunch company of grenadiers took her far\nleft flank closest to the plateau, ready in case Sedial dispatched troops\ndirectly from the city.\nOlem rushed back and forth, intercepting messengers, issuing\ncommands, and keeping all of the minute details straight with an accuracy\nthat Vlora couldn’t hope to match. He soon returned to her side and, in a\nlow voice, asked, “The afternoon is advancing. Are we going to attack\ntonight? Or should we dig in for camp?”\nVlora hesitated only a moment before answering.

If they attacked and\nhad a hard time making progress, they could be forced back into the\nkeelboats overnight. But if they dug in and waited until dawn, it would give\nSedial an immense amount of time to rearrange his defense.\nAnd she still couldn’t shake the feeling that he was simply buying time\nto use the godstones.\n“Get our auxiliaries digging trenches on our flanks, but tell them to be\nready to move at a moment’s notice. We’re attacking today unless Sedial\nsurrenders.”\nThe message was relayed, and Vlora was left to watch as the\npreparations continued. She dabbed a bit of powder on her tongue, relishing\nthe sizzle that it sent through her body and wrestling with the urge to take\nmore. Only a few minutes passed before a rider appeared, rushing toward\nVlora and not bothering to dismount before belting out a warning.\n“Lady Flint! Word from General Sabastenien. He says that the provosts\nhave—”\n“General Vlora Flint!” a voice boomed.\nVlora whirled from the rider, turning toward a column of provosts that\nhad appeared between the lines of her own men. There were at least two\nhundred of them, pushing their way through the regular soldiery, and at\ntheir head was Provost Marshal Valeer. She fixed him with a cool look and\ncrossed her arms.\n“Valeer! I thought you’d wait in the wings until the real fighting was\ndone. Are you here to lead the main charge?”\nThe provost marshal strode toward Vlora until he was mere paces away,\nhis hand on his sword, his chin lifted and lip curled. Olem subtly stepped\nout ahead of Vlora and ashed a cigarette toward Valeer. “It’s ‘Field Marshal’\nnow,” he said.\nValeer sniffed at the sash around Vlora’s neck. “We’ll see about that.\nVlora Flint, you have orders to end this offensive immediately. Lady\nSnowbound has secured a cease-fire with the Great Ka of Dynize. Stand\ndown, or face the consequences.”\nVlora eyeballed Valeer’s provosts as they fanned out to surround her and\nOlem, and noticed that both Bo and Nila were elsewhere—clearly\nsomething that Valeer had planned on. She maintained her cool demeanor.\n“Has she?”\n“She has, and I’m here to insist that you give the order to stand down at\nthis very moment.”\n“I won’t give such an order until I hear the terms of the cease-fire.”\n“The terms are not your concern. The stability of Adran international\nrelations is your concern, and you are on the very precipice of plunging us\ninto an extended conflict that we cannot hope to win. Stand down!”\nAt a gesture from Olem, Vlora’s bodyguard assembled from where\nthey’d been resting nearby. Though heavily outnumbered, they shouldered\ntheir way through the provosts until they had joined Vlora’s side. It was a\nshow of solidarity that gave her a fresh breath of confidence. Beyond the"

Beyond the\ncordon of provosts, officers and regular army soldiers began to take a great\ninterest in the proceedings.\n“Olem,” Vlora said, not taking her eyes off Valeer, “send a runner to the\ngeneral staff. Let them know they’re to stand by for further orders.”\n“I said, ‘Stand down,’” Valeer snapped.\n“I heard you the first several times,” Vlora replied, “but like I said, I\nwon’t do any such thing until I know what deal the Lady Snowbound has\nmade. Where is she?”\n“With the Great Ka.”\nVlora scoffed. Delia must have landed her provosts and practically\nsprinted off to meet with Sedial for her to have already made a deal. “And\nthe terms of the cease-fire.”\nValeer straightened his shoulders, drawing himself up. “While you\nplayed at soldier up north, we have been arranging for the end to hostilities.\nLady Snowbound has handed over the capstone of the Yellow Creek\ngodstone to the Dynize. In return, they have pledged—”\n“You what?” Vlora snarled.\n“We have handed over—”\nShe cut him off again, drawing her sword before she’d given the action\nconscious thought. “What insanity could have possibly compelled you to\nhand that madman the key to the power he seeks?”\n“You dare to draw your sword at me?” Valeer replied, taking a step back\nand thrusting a finger toward her. “Your mad thirst for blood will see us all\ndead—Delia and I have taken steps to avoid that. We gave them the\ncapstone the moment the army left the coast. Now, put up your sword if you\never want to see Adro again!”\n“Take it from me,” she snarled.\n“We know your secret, Lady Flint,” Valeer proclaimed haughtily. “You\ncan’t use your sorcery. Provosts! Arrest this woman in the name of the\nRepublic of Adro!”\nA moment of confusion hung in the air, and the provosts stared at their\nleader as if they couldn’t imagine it would go this far. In that instant, Olem\ndrew his sword and pistol and shouted, “The provosts have turned on Lady\nFlint. To arms!”\nVlora’s bodyguard took two steps outward and lowered their bayoneted\nrifles, putting Vlora into the center of a steel hedgehog formation. The only\nopening faced Valeer, and the provost marshal drew his own sword and\nleapt toward her. He had barely made it half a step when a shot rang out in\nVlora’s ear. Valeer gave a gasp and stumbled back, staring at the smoke that\nrose from Olem’s pistol. Clutching his chest, the provost marshal collapsed.\n“If you set down your weapons right now, you will be allowed to return\nto your comrades alive,” Olem said loudly.\nThe closest provosts looked down at their dying marshal, then at Olem.\nThey were drawn from what little remained of the old nobility, and most of\nthem had a good reason to personally dislike Vlora and Olem.

She could see on their faces that they knew\nthe improbability of their leaving this place alive if they tried to follow\nValeer’s last order.\nBeginning with the few closest, they threw down their rifles.\n“Get rid of this,” Vlora said, gesturing to Valeer, “and escort these men\nto the rest of their comrades.” The provosts were mobbed by the regular\nsoldiery and swept away, while Vlora took advantage of the chaos to catch\nher breath. She could feel her heart hammering from the confrontation, and\neven another hit of powder couldn’t keep her hands from shaking. She\nturned to Olem. “Do we know if our fleet has arrived to reinforce us from\nthe coast?”\n“They’re supposed to be here tonight or tomorrow.”\n“Send a runner around the north side of the plateau to try and flag them\ndown. We need to know if Delia really did secret away the capstone.” She\nswore under her breath and realized that her adrenaline wasn’t from the\nconfrontation but from the implications of what Valeer had revealed. “All\nthose meetings. Our own discussions. Delia played me for a fool the whole\ntime. Damn it!” She turned toward Valeer, who lay on the ground nearby,\nsupported by two of his men, blood leaking from his lips. He barely seemed\nto know where he was anymore, and would likely be dead within the hour.\n“Did Delia really think I’d just surrender?” she asked Olem. “Did she not\nunderstand that this is more important than anyone’s career, including\nmine?” She caught herself just short of throwing her sword. “Recall the\npolitical officer,” she belted at her cadre of waiting messengers. “Tell the\ngeneral staff to prepare to advance.”\n“Ma’am!” a voice called. “I’m sorry to interrupt, but—”\n“What is it?” Vlora demanded, whirling on a soldier standing just behind\nher.\nThe soldier had a Palo man by the collar. The Palo was of medium\nheight with a short, wispy beard and a gaunt face. His left hand was\nwrapped in bloody bandages and looked like it was missing a couple of\nfingers. “Sorry, ma’am. He surrendered to our pickets. Claims he works for\nTaniel Two-shot and has urgent news. Thought you might want to talk to\nhim.”\nThe Palo removed his flatcap. “Michel Bravis, Son of the Red Hand, at\nyour service.”\nCHAPTER 64\nM\nichel’s escort dragged him across the riverbank, following Lady Flint to\nwhere a handful of camp followers had hastily erected an open-sided tent. A\nhandful of important-looking officers with gold epaulets on their Adran\nblues had already found the shade of the tent. A table was brought in and\ncovered with maps and reports in the matter of a few moments. Lady Flint\nrounded the table, sorting the papers around with a critical eye, and then\nbarked off a series of orders. Waiting messengers scattered like pigeons in\nevery direction.\nShe finally turned toward Michel and frowned at his escort.\n“Dismissed,” she said, and the man released Michel and took off after the\nmessengers.\nMichel stood just outside of the shade of the tent, looking around,"

His entire left arm throbbed\nfrom the pain in his hand, and while Tenik’s stitches were tight, the new\nbandages were already soaked with blood. He wanted nothing more than to\nlie down on the ground and fall asleep. But he couldn’t. Not while Ichtracia\nwas still held by her grandfather.\n“Taniel told me you were his best spy and to make contact when we\nreached Landfall,” Vlora suddenly said, still looking at her maps. It took\nMichel a moment to realize she was talking to him, and he gratefully\nstepped under the tent.\n“I’m flattered.”\n“And I would have completely forgotten if you hadn’t shown up,” Vlora\nsaid. Her tone was clipped—all business—and it seemed that every other\nbreath was to give orders to another messenger or one of the officers\ngathered around. The command tent had, in just a few moments, become\nthe nexus of the entire battle grinding into motion around them. “I’m a bit\nbusy here, so you better make your report quickly.” She looked up, over his\nhead, squinting into the distance. “Start with what’s going on in the city.”\nMichel took a moment to sort through everything in his head, ordering\ninformation from most to least important. “We discovered that Sedial used\nPalo blood to unlock the restrictions Ka-poel made to the Landfall\ngodstone. The Palo have risen up, and there are riots, barricades, and\nfighting in the streets. At least, there were. He’s ordered all of his soldiers\nout of Landfall to deal with you.”\nVlora looked up at her second-in-command. Michel remembered\nColonel Olem from his time as their Blackhat liaison, and the man hadn’t\nchanged a bit. He even had a cigarette still hanging out of the corner of his\nmouth. Olem gave Vlora a sharp nod. “That explains all the villages up\nnorth. They were probably using them for blood sacrifices as well.”\n“I don’t follow,” Michel said.\n“Sedial’s crimes extend far out of Landfall,” Olem said, but did not\nexplain further. “Go on.”\n“My people,” Michel continued, “have made contact with Sedial’s\nenemies among the Dynize. We’re doing what we can to gather an internal\nresistance against Sedial, but I don’t think there’s real time to do anything.\nThe godstones have been active for over a month now. We can only guess\nthat he’s waiting for the last godstone to make his move, but I suspect that if\nyou win the day, he will attempt to use them regardless.”\nHe now had Vlora’s undivided attention. She peered at him thoughtfully,\na serious look on her face. “He does have all three godstones.”\n“Oh.”\n“It’s broken,” Olem explained, “but he has the capstone.

He will not risk losing this war.”\nMichel gestured toward the godstone and the battle that had begun to join to\ntheir south. He could hear the shouts of officers, then the crack of muskets\nand rifles. A cloud of powder smoke rose into the air and great battle cries\nrose from the ranks. It all sounded so close that it made him want to run\nback to the relative protection of the catacombs. None of the assembled\nofficers appeared to even notice the hubbub.\nVlora seemed to consider Michel’s words. “Do you have any idea what\nkind of preparations he’ll need to undertake to use the godstones?”\n“No. Blood, probably.”\n“And do we have any idea what the godstones will do?” she asked\nOlem.\n“Beyond making a god? Could be anything.”\nVlora let out a soft laugh. “So we don’t know when, and we don’t know\nwhat, but we’re sure that Sedial is about to do something. This is\nterrifying.” She didn’t look terrified. She looked annoyed, like someone\nwho’d been given a bigger job than she’d expected and told to do it in half\nthe time. “Fine. It’s all the more important that we kick in his door and take\naway his toys. Olem, send word to the brigadiers that we’re running out of\ntime. Tell Silvia that she’s to have the flares ready for when darkness falls.\nWe’re not stopping this offensive until we capture the fortress.”\n“The casualties—” Olem began.\nVlora took a sharp breath, cutting him off with a nod. “I accept the risk\nand the responsibility.”\n“Yes, ma’am.” The orders were given, and Olem returned to her side.\nWhat he said next was in a low tone, just loud enough that Michel could\nhear. “We do have another option.”\n“Go on.”\n“We can try to kill him.”\nVlora looked up from her maps once more. “If he shows his head, I’ve\nalready given the mages permission to blow it off.”\n“He’s not going to show his head,” Olem replied, “but after dark we can\nsend a couple of mages to scale the walls and seek him out.”\nMichel caught his breath, looking between the two Adrans. “There will\nbe at least a handful of dragonmen and bone-eyes inside that fortress. And\nprobably a garrison of thousands.”\n“It would be a suicide mission,” Vlora agreed, rubbing her chin.\n“But it might be worth it,” Olem said.\nVlora began to pace, scowling at the ground at her feet. Michel could\npractically see her weighing her options. He couldn’t imagine that even a\npowder mage could crack whatever guard Sedial had around him, but Vlora\nand Olem clearly thought otherwise.\nHe clenched his jaw, thinking of Ichtracia deep in the fortress.

And what\nhappened if Vlora did kick in the door with artillery and sorcery and\nbayonets? Would Ichtracia survive the chaos that ensued? A plan began to\nform in Michel’s head, and he considered the idea of a couple of assassins\nnot just for assassins’ sake, but as a distraction.\n“It should be me,” Vlora finally said.\nThe words were barely out of her mouth when Olem responded,\n“Absolutely not.”\n“Tamas would have done it,” Vlora responded, the corners of her eyes\nhardening with stubbornness.\n“You’re not Tamas,” Olem replied, and it became clear that this was part\nof some wider argument that Michel could not fathom. “And if the\nassassination fails, you need to be here to make sure the army does not.\nGive me two of your mages and twenty grenadiers. I can do it myself.”\n“No!” The word was almost desperate. “No,” Vlora repeated. “You’re\nnot going anywhere. If I’m vital, then you’re vital.”\nOlem seemed about to argue his point, but shook his head. “Then it’s not\nhappening.”\n“I’ll do it.” The voice cut through the tent, and a man shouldered his\nway through the small group to stand between Vlora and Olem. He carried a\nrifle and wore one of the silver keg pins of a powder mage.\nVlora cast him a hard look. “Davd. You’re supposed to be on artillery\nduty.”\n“Silvia has the enemy artillery contained,” Davd reported. “At least until\nwe get within range of the fortress. I actually came to suggest that we get\nsomeone close to deal with the artillery after dark, but if you want to\nassassinate Ka-Sedial, I’m your man.”\nVlora hesitated.\n“All it takes is one bullet,” Davd pointed out. “I can get in, find a high\nspot, take a shot, and get out. If I can make it back to the base of the wall,\nno dragonman will be able to catch up with me.”\nOlem and Vlora exchanged glances, and it became clear that Olem was\nmore in favor of the idea than his general. Michel could feel his own hasty\nplans now falling into place. This could work. It had to work. He\nconsidered his discussions with Survivor and the route the old man had\ntaken out of the fortress and across the marshes, painting it out in his head.\n“I can guide him there,” he suddenly blurted.\nEveryone looked in his direction, and he nodded with a confidence that\nhe forced himself to feel. One distraction, even a failed attempt on Sedial’s\nlife, might be all he needed to get inside and retrieve Ichtracia. “I can do it,”\nhe insisted. “Give me the mage and I’ll make sure he gets inside the\nfortress.”\nCHAPTER 65\nS\ntyke stood at the end of the causeway leading to Etzi’s compound, facing"

His side burned from the\ndragonman’s knife, while the rest of his body ached from a pounding that\nwould be a myriad of bruises in a couple of days.\nIf, that was, he could survive that long.\nHe couldn’t take his eyes off Amrec’s body. Someone from the\nHousehold had emerged an hour ago and covered it reverently with a\nblanket, but that just seemed to make the poor creature’s corpse stand out\nmore in the mess that remained of Sedial’s hired mob. Maetle walked\nthrough it all, tending to the wounded on both sides but clearly out of her\ndepth. No surgeon, no matter how skilled, was ready for their first time of\nseeing true carnage. Styke sympathized. In another time, he might have\nreveled at the destruction he had caused. But having to put a bullet in the\nhead of his own horse had taken all the glory out of his deeds. He felt tired,\nhurting, and sick to his stomach.\nOnly a handful of his Lancers were to be seen. The rest rode through the\nborough, establishing order at the tips of their lances, forcing peace on the\nimmediate area surrounding Etzi’s compound. Occasionally a report came\nback to Styke. He barely listened. He’d put Ibana in charge of securing their\nlocation. He had no urge to deal with any more than he already had.\n“Ben.” The soft voice forced him to take his eyes off Amrec’s covered\ncorpse. Celine stood by his side. She looked across the mayhem with\nconcern, then focused on his blood-covered face.\n“I thought I told you to stay inside,” Styke rebuked her gently.\n“They sent me to get you.”\n“Who?”\n“Etzi. Some of the Household heads have arrived. They’re pressuring\nKa-poel to take on the mantle of the Great Ka and ally the Mad Lancers\nwith their faction. They think you’ll help convince her.”\n“They didn’t come out to get me themselves?” Styke scoffed.\n“I think they’re afraid of you.”\nStyke let his eyes play across what remained of the mob once more and\ntossed his broken lance aside. “Good.” He let Celine take him by his gore-\nslick gauntlet and lead him back across the causeway. He walked with a bit\nof a limp, his side burning, wondering if he should get out of his armor and\ndeal with this wound before he bled out. As they passed through the gates of\nthe compound, Etzi’s Household guard stared at Styke in silence. Only the\nboy, Jerio, approached him, holding up a mug of beer. Styke took it with\ngrateful thanks, downing it in two long drafts, and then followed Celine into\nthe Household amphitheater.\nA table had been set up in the center of the space. Ka-poel sat at one\nend, Etzi at the other. Arrayed down either side were nine more figures.\nStyke had watched them all arrive, though he hadn’t paid attention to their\nidentities.

        "text": "Styke had watched them all arrive, though he hadn’t paid attention to their\nidentities. He could only assume that these were the Household heads. The\nonly one he recognized was Meln-Sika, the woman who’d warned Etzi\nabout the covert purge.\n“Please sit, Colonel Styke,” Etzi said, pointing to the one empty chair at\nthe table.\nStyke looked down at his bloody armor, looked at the chair, then limped\naround to stand just behind Ka-poel. He gave each of the Household heads\na long glance. A few of the Dynize shifted uncomfortably in their seats,\nwhile others regarded him warily, as if reassessing him.\nIt was Meln-Sika who finally cleared her throat. “This is a poor quorum,\nmy friends, but I believe this is the best we can manage. The rest of our\nallies are either dead or trapped inside their compounds. Do I have\nunanimous agreement to continue?” The ten Household heads each raised a\nhand. Meln-Sika acknowledged the vote with a nod, then lifted her chin\ntoward Ka-poel. “At this, our most desperate hour, will you put your lot in\nwith us? Will you become the Great Ka and help us force the emperor to\ndismiss Ka-Sedial?”\nTo Styke’s eyes, Ka-poel looked so small and fragile sitting there at his\nside. But her jaw was firm, her lips pursed. She began to gesture, and it was\nCeline who translated. I am not a trained politician. If I take on the mantle\nof the Great Ka, I’m sure every one of you is already too aware at how\nmuch help I will need.\n“We’d be honored to stand by your side,” Meln-Sika replied, bowing her\nhead.\n“That’s not what she means,” Styke grunted.\nKa-poel pointed at him, a small smile fluttering across her lips. I will not\nbe a puppet. You know my grandfather, so you already know my\ntemperament. If you put me forward as Great Ka, you are accepting the risk\nof my rule. I will accept guidance. I will not be controlled.\nSilence descended at the table. Styke could see the Household heads\nconsidering her words. Etzi was the only one who seemed to take them as a\nmatter of course and had already made his decision. “Understood,” he told\nher. “Do you have further demands?”\nKa-poel’s fingers flashed. I am hesitant to make a decision without my\nhusband, but I know that time is short and we cannot afford to wait for him.\nShe let out a soft sigh. I have one further demand: that no one interfere\nwhen I destroy the godstone.\nMeln-Sika inhaled sharply. Several of the Household heads appeared\nvisibly shocked. Once again, only Etzi was unsurprised, but Styke knew he\nhad had several weeks to get to know Ka-poel. He knew what to expect. “It\nis our inheritance,” Meln-Sika said, her shaky tone betraying her fear. “It is\nour hope as a people.”\nHope? Ka-poel answered through Celine. Her lip curled as she gestured.\nIt is a rock imbued with the power of a million dead. There is no hope to be\nhad from any of the godstones. They are nothing but an avenue toward"

The only hope the Dynize people need is that of unity.\n“We haven’t had unity since our god was murdered,” a man halfway\ndown the table objected. “Not until Sedial gave us the hope of the\ngodstones.”\nSedial gave you the godstones because he knew that you all hated him so\nmuch, he could never unite you himself. I won’t have that problem. Ka-poel\ntapped her fingers on the table thoughtfully before continuing. I am here. I\nwill destroy the godstone. Whether you choose to place me in a position of\npower once I have accomplished my task is up to you. Decide quickly.\nIt was the second time speed had been mentioned, and Styke leaned\ndown to whisper in her ear. “Are we in a rush?”\nShe nodded. Yes.\n“Why?”\nShe did not answer the question. Etzi raised his hand and, once he had\neveryone’s attention, said, “I’ve spoken with my brother. Based on the\nnumber of dragonman sightings throughout the city today, we estimate that\nthe emperor is practically undefended. If we want to force him to renounce\nKa-Sedial, this might be our only chance to do so.” His expression\nhardened. “You,” he said to Ka-poel, “may have to break Sedial’s hold on\nthe emperor before we can force his hand. I truly believe that Sedial would\nkill the emperor before relinquishing power.”\nMeln-Sika sniffed. “This assumes we agree to allow the destruction of\nthe godstone.”\n“And if we don’t?” Etzi rounded on his colleague, thrusting a hand\ntoward Styke. “You expect us to fight Sedial’s mobs and defend the\ngodstone against the Mad Lancers? We have no choice. Ka-poel is right.\nThe godstone was a symbol to unite us. If there is power to be got from it,\ndo you think that Sedial will share? We do not need a god to make us whole\nagain. We need a Great Ka who does not contrive to enslave us.”\n“We barely know her,” Meln-Sika retorted. “How do we know that isn’t\nexactly what she will do?”\nEtzi threw up his hands. “We can have an enemy who will murder us all,\nor we can have an untested ally. There are no other choices—no one else\nhas the birthright to unite us and the power to challenge Ka-Sedial. Choose\nyour graves.”\n“I…” Meln-Sika began, only for Ka-poel to slam her fist on the table.\nThe entire room jumped, including Styke, and he looked down to find Ka-\npoel leaning forward, eyes wild, a look of focus on her face. She gestured\nemphatically.\nYou must decide now! Celine translated.\n“We’ve barely had time to discuss it,” Meln-Sika objected.\nKa-poel lurched to her feet, and Styke reached out to catch her by the\narm. She shook him off and glared at the group.

Decide!\nEtzi blinked back at her for a moment, then gestured to the rest of the\nHousehold heads. “A vote, then, for our small quorum. Those willing to\nback Ka-poel as the Great Ka?” He raised his hand.\nTwo more hands shot up immediately. Three followed slowly. Meln-Sika\ngrimaced and hesitantly raised her own, and once she had acquiesced, the\nremaining four joined her. Another unanimous vote, though Styke could tell\nthat many of them were unhappy with the speed at which the discussion had\ntaken place. Good, Ka-poel gestured. Styke, gather your Lancers. We go to\nthe imperial palace immediately.\nEven Etzi was surprised by the declaration. “We should gather our\nforces,” he said. “We can risk an hour or two to bring more Household\nheads and soldiers to our cause.”\nNo, Ka-poel gestured. We cannot. Sedial has begun the ritual to wake\nthe godstones. If we do not go now, it will be too late.\nStyke heard a shout from Etzi’s front gate and, within a few moments,\nthe hammering of running feet. It was Maetle who burst into the meeting,\nshoving aside one of the Household head guards. “Meln-Etzi, Meln-Sika,\nKa-poel! Something is happening to the godstone! The whole city glows\nred!”\nWhile the others fell into confusion, Styke turned to Ka-poel. Her face\ngrew determined, and she gestured to one side so that only he could see\nwhat she said.\nGet me to the godstone. These fools have no idea what is about to\nhappen. If I do not challenge Ka-Sedial now, there will be no challenge.\nCHAPTER 66\nM\nichel and Davd took a long, circuitous route through the coastal\nmarshes and approached the fortress from the east. It took them more time\nthan he would have liked, and it quickly became clear that the powder mage\nwas impatient over how slowly Michel was moving. He couldn’t shake the\nfeeling that he should just give Davd some vague instructions and let him\nloose—but he knew this was his only chance of reaching Ichtracia. Artillery\nand sorcery crackled over a smoke-filled battlefield to their northwest as the\nAdran and Dynize war machines slammed into each other with a violence\nthat Michel could feel in his bones even at a distance. The setting sun\nplayed through it all, turning the horizon a brilliant, black-tinged orange for\nthe space of a few minutes.\nOnce they’d left the coastal marshes, they proceeded through a rubble\nfield and ramshackle tent village full of frightened Palo laborers hunkering\ndown to weather the distant battle and Landfall riots. Davd quickly captured\na Dynize uniform jacket for himself, which he wore over his Adran blues.\nMichel expected martial law in the laborer village, but there appeared to be\nno one of consequence—whatever common soldiery still occupied the place\nkept their eyes glued to the battle.

It was a sprawling thing, far\nlarger—and far less complete—than Michel had guessed. Much of the\neastern wall was still covered in scaffolding, the lower stone blocks covered\nin a finishing mortar while many of the upper blocks had yet to be put in\nplace. The area at the base of the wall was a mess of cranes, carts, tools, and\nstone.\nSurvivor had described his exit through the base of an incomplete well\nwhere a natural spring drained from the area. It took a moment’s\nexamination to find that the area had been walled in during the time since—\na great culvert now drained into the old streambed. It was big enough to\ncrawl through, but protected by thick iron bars.\n“That’s not going to work,” Michel muttered to himself, squinting at the\nscaffolding along the wall. “That was our way in,” he told Davd, “but it’s\nbeen bricked up.”\n“I can climb that scaffolding.”\n“I was thinking the same thing.”\nThe powder mage frowned at the top of the wall. “You don’t need to\ncome any farther. We’re here. I’ll find the son of a bitch.”\n“No,” Michel said, almost too quickly. “I’m coming.”\nThe words had barely left his mouth when Davd snatched him by the\nfront of his shirt and threw him down behind a discarded stone block.\nMichel didn’t even have the chance to voice an objection before a sudden\ncrack split his ears. The very earth seemed to rumble. For a moment, Michel\nthought that it had started to rain heavily—only to realize that tiny pieces of\nstone were falling all around them in a fine hail. He put his hands over his\nhead, listening to the disconcerting sound and staring at Davd.\n“Flint’s pushing hard!” Davd shouted, pointing above them. Michel\nlooked up to see that one of the gun towers less than fifty paces to their\nnorth had suddenly ceased to exist. A jagged stone remnant, wreathed in\nsmoke and crackling with lightning, was all that remained. “If Nila is close\nenough to do that, the army is nearby!” Michel stared at Davd, trying to\nfigure out why he was shouting, only to realize that the sound seemed\ndistant and muddled. His ears rang.\n“Are we still going in?” he shouted back.\n“They might still stop her,” Davd replied, regaining his footing and\nheading to the scaffolding. “You need to stay here. I can’t wait for you.”\nMichel watched helplessly as Davd took a deep breath from something\nin his pocket, swung his rifle onto his back, and leapt onto the scaffolding.\nThe leap seemed effortless but must have been six feet, and he scrambled\nup the scaffolding like a spider. He was at the top of the incomplete wall\nwithin moments, leaving Michel behind.\n“Well, there goes my distraction.” Michel swore under his breath and\nfollowed the powder mage. His ascent proved painfully slow, as his own\nlack of sorcery—and his ruined hand—kept him from making the leaps and\nquick judgment that Davd had displayed.

Michel worked methodically,\nfinding the ladders and safest routes, gaining each level with only a pause to\nlisten to his ringing ears in an attempt to judge the distance of the armies\nclashing beyond the northern wall of the fortress.\nAnother explosion shook the scaffolding dangerously. Michel clung to\nthe stone facade with all his might until the shaking had passed. He had no\nability to judge whether the explosion had been sorcery or artillery.\nHe was just climbing through a gap left between two big stone blocks at\nthe top when a sudden brilliance caught him off guard. The sun had almost\ncompletely set, leaving most of the fortress shrouded in darkness, and for a\nmoment he thought that the Dynize had begun firing flares. He squinted\ntoward the sky, trying to find the source.\nA thrill of fear went through him when he realized that the godstone had\nbegun to glow. The triangular cap at the top bathed the battlefield in a\nyellow light as if a second sun had suddenly appeared. The fear almost sent\nMichel scrambling back to the dubious safety of the scaffolding, but he\nforced himself to roll off the wall and onto the unfinished battlements. He\ndropped into a crouch, squinting against the light of the godstone, and\nattempted to get his bearings.\nThe fortress was easily as big as the capital building up in Landfall,\nsprawling and cavernous, but it became immediately clear that the builders\nhad put all of their effort into the walls and gun towers. The inside was little\nmore than a pit filled with the detritus of construction—scaffolding, cranes,\nstone. Michel could see everything from his hiding spot. The big fortress\ndoors were kitty-corner from his position, flanked by high gun towers. The\narea swarmed with soldiers, running up and down wooden ramps carrying\nammunition up to the guns. While the fortress floor was a flurry of activity,\neveryone who wasn’t focused on the defense was staring, dumbfounded, up\nat the godstone.\nNo one had noticed Michel. At least for the moment.\nThe godstone itself was protected by an inner keep that appeared to be\nfinished. The high stone walls were clear of scaffolding; the mighty doors\nstood open and were heavily guarded. Even glancing in that direction gave\nMichel a dark sense of unease, though the glances he threw in that direction\nrevealed that bodies were being carried out of the keep—an alarming\nnumber of them.\nSomething else caught his attention: a relatively small pyramid, a single\npiece of stone, sitting off to one side of the courtyard. Nobody appeared to\npay it much mind, but it glowed with a less powerful crimson light, pulsing\nin time with the top of the godstone. This, he realized, must be the capstone\nthat Flint had mentioned.\nHe hurried along the battlements parallel to the keep, toward the back of\nthe fortress, his eyes on a ramp that would get him down to the main floor.\nThere were a handful of buildings there—two long barracks, and a half-\ndozen smaller units, all made of wood. If Ichtracia was to be found, he had\nno doubt she was in one of those. He paused occasionally to watch for\nguards, taking advantage of the deep shadows thrown by the pulsating"

        "text": "no doubt she was in one of those. He paused occasionally to watch for\nguards, taking advantage of the deep shadows thrown by the pulsating\ngodstone to hide behind construction materials.\nIt was during one of these pauses that he spotted Davd. The powder\nmage had made it all the way around to the opposite side of the fortress,\nclearly heading toward an unfinished tower that would give him the best\nvantage point. Davd sprinted across the battlements, carving his way\nthrough a small group of Dynize soldiers, catching them unaware.\nMichel watched his progress until one of the Dynize spotted him. An\nalarm was raised quickly despite the overwhelming thunder of the artillery,\nand a great deal of attention shifted to Davd. The attention, he realized, was\nboth a boon and a bane. It would allow Michel to sneak through more\neasily, but it may just have ruined their shot at killing Sedial before this\ncould get any worse.\n“Good luck,” he wished the powder mage, and descended from the wall\ntoward the barracks below.\nHe was about halfway down when his head began to hurt. It was a\nstabbing pain, like the worst kind of hangover, and it made him stumble and\nnearly plummet from the ramps. He caught himself on the building, rubbing\nfuriously at his temples. For the briefest moment, he couldn’t remember\nwhere he was. The confusion passed and he forced himself back to his feet,\ntaking the descent with more caution.\nThe ramp turned at an alcove that led into a hallway in the outer wall.\nMichel paused, watching for guards, and then turned down the ramp. Or, at\nleast, that’s what he’d intended to do.\nInstead, he continued forward, walking down the hallway at a leisurely\npace. The rest of his body still seemed to obey him—his head still turned,\nhis arms worked—everything but his legs. Confusion grew to irritation, and\nthen to concern, and then to panic all in the space of a dozen steps. His\nadrenaline kicked into overdrive as he fought with his own body, trying to\nget himself to turn around.\nIt was in vain. He continued down the hall guided by the light of the\ngodstone until the hallway turned with the angle of the wall. He was\npresented with a door on his right, flanked by a pair of Dynize dragonmen.\nThe two glanced at Michel curiously, and he tried to scramble backward,\nonly to find that even his arms wouldn’t obey him anymore.\n“He’s here to see me,” a voice called from within. Michel felt himself\nseized with fear as he finally realized what was happening. His body began\nto sweat and shake uncontrollably, and he strolled right between the two\ndragonmen and through the door.\nIt was a small room—meant to be a guard post, perhaps, or maybe an\nofficer’s bedroom. It was occupied by a writing desk and a single stool, the\nlatter of which was positioned beside a slit of a window that overlooked the\ninner fortress. Ka-Sedial sat on the stool, smiling pleasantly, head craned as\nhe watched something that only he could see. Ichtracia sat on the floor\nbehind him.

She was covered in bruises, her face a bloody mess, the left cheek\nmarred by a burn scar that extended from her temple down the side of her\nneck. She wore a strange yoke—a wooden beam that ran behind her neck\nand held both of her arms up where her hands could be seen clearly. Each\nindividual finger was locked separately in a tiny vise.\n“Hello, Michel,” Sedial said pleasantly, turning away from the window.\n“You may have noticed that Ka-poel is no longer protecting you.” Michel’s\neyes darted to the writing desk, where a vial of blood sat beside a purple,\nwithered finger. His blood. His finger. His terror escalated beyond the\nability for rational thought.\nAt his name, Ichtracia’s head rolled and her eyes flickered. A bit of drool\ntrickled out of the corner of her mouth.\n“She’s quite drugged,” Sedial said. “Helpless as a babe.” He brushed his\nfingertips across Ichtracia’s forehead, then briefly touched the yoke behind\nher shoulders. “The brace is just an extra precaution. What’s wrong,\nMichel? I’ve left you your ability to speak. No witty reply? No desperate\nplea to release Ichtracia?” Sedial grimaced, as if realizing how petty he\nsounded, and glanced back out the window. “I have to admit, when you\npopped back into the periphery of my senses, I was more than a little\nsurprised that you were coming here. Well, maybe it shouldn’t have been a\nsurprise. You’re an arrogant little spy. The powder mage was a surprise…\nbut my dragonmen will deal with him soon.”\nSedial slapped his knees happily and stood up, knuckling his back like\nan old man preparing for a walk in the park. “It’s almost time, my boy!\nYou’re going to have a great honor, you know.” He grasped a leather cord,\ntugging it gently until Ichtracia shifted onto her knees and then climbed,\nawkwardly, to her feet. Her eyes were red and unfocused, and Michel felt\nhis chest tightening with fear and anger at the sight of someone so strong\nbrought so low. He suddenly turned without giving his body instructions to\ndo so, and followed as Sedial led Ichtracia out into the hall.\n“You seem to be in a very good mood for someone who’s about to be\ncrushed by the Adran Army,” Michel said as they walked down the hall. It\nwas the best jab he could muster, but it had no strength to it. His voice was\ndull. Defeated.\nSedial didn’t respond, heading out onto the ramp and descending to the\ninner fortress, Ichtracia following in a stupor, and Michel unable to do\nanything but tag along behind. He could sense the dragonmen take up\nposition behind him, but when he tried to turn his head, he found that he\ncould not. He prayed for the crack of Davd’s rifle and a magical bullet\nsplitting Sedial’s skull. It didn’t come.\n“We’ve caught up so much over the last few days, she and I,” Sedial said\nover his shoulder, giving a little tug to Ichtracia’s leash. “She says you’re in\nlove with her. Is that true?”"

Is that true?”\nMichel bit down on his tongue until a pressure deep inside his belly\nforced him to speak. “I don’t know.” A well of emotion followed the words\nand, if he’d been allowed, he might have begun to sob.\nSedial looked a little disappointed. “She’s fairly confident. You must at\nleast care if you’ve come to try and fetch her. Ah, well. ‘Care’ is good\nenough for my purposes.” They rounded the inner keep that housed the\ngodstone and paused beside the big doors while soldiers carried out another\ncorpse, then proceeded inside. Unlike the rest of the fortress, the keep was\npristine and orderly. There was no rubble or equipment. The floors and\nwalls were polished white marble. There was nothing inside except the\ngodstone and twenty or so attendants. A wide, bloody altar lay at the base of\nthe obelisk.\nMichel fought Sedial’s hold harder, calling out for Ka-poel in his mind.\nThere was no answer.\nSedial stopped in front of the altar, a little frown on his face, blood\npooling around his sandals. A blast shattered the air, and one of the gun\ntowers fell silent. “They… you,” he said to Michel, “all think me a monster.\nIt’s so strange to me. All I’m trying to do is impose order, and yet my\nenemies swarm like locusts.” He gave a little sigh. “It won’t matter in a few\nminutes. Up you go!” He prodded Ichtracia, forcing her up a little\nstepladder onto the blood-soaked altar. Michel thought he saw a flicker in\nher eyes and a twitch in her shoulders. He silently willed her to fight.\nInstead, she lowered herself to her knees. One of the dragonmen climbed\nup beside her and carefully removed the yoke holding her arms and hands,\nthen pushed her gently onto her back.\n“She thought,” Sedial said as he watched the proceeding, “that I needed\nher blood to unlock Ka-poel’s hold on the godstone. I did need blood, quite\na lot of it, but what I needed her for? Well, my granddaughter is no ordinary\nsacrifice. To open the godstone to me, the blood needs power. She has it in\nspades. She, Michel, is going to help me change the world. It’s a good\ndeath. Unlike yours.” He patted Michel affectionately on the shoulder and\nhanded him a knife. “Up you go.”\nMichel’s terror reached a crescendo as he ascended the stepladder.\nDarkness touched the corners of his vision as he fought the compulsion\nwith every ounce of his being. He screamed at himself to stop—to turn and\nplunge the knife into Sedial’s chest. Instead, he turned on his heel and knelt\ndown beside Ichtracia. He raised the knife.\n“Wait,” Sedial said. “It must be coordinated with a sacrifice at the main\ngodstone in Talunlica.” He paused, lips moving silently as if speaking to a\nvoice in his head.

The\nknife rammed between Ichtracia’s ribs. She let out a muted gasp, body\ntwitching, and he jerked the knife out of her, sagging back onto his knees.\nHe could do nothing but watch her chest as the blood bubbled out of it.\nSedial tsked. “You missed her heart, my boy. I suppose this is your first\ntime. Shall we try again?”\n“Please don’t,” Michel whispered as his hands jerked back up, holding\nthe knife above Ichtracia’s chest. He felt a brief breeze on the side of his\nneck and heard something like a sigh.\n“Ah. No need. That was enough blood,” Sedial said happily. “Look.”\nMichel was allowed to turn his head toward the godstone. A rectangle\nhad appeared on the stone surface, about the size of a door. It glowed with\nthe same light as the top of the godstone, though greatly muted. Michel\nsuddenly felt hot breath on his ear and could sense that Sedial had stepped\nonto the altar with him.\n“I don’t know what attention I’ll be able to turn toward mortal pleasures\nonce I am a god.

The anguish you have felt these last few moments is nothing.” Another\naffectionate pat on Michel’s shoulder. “I go into the Else!” Sedial\nannounced to his assistants, straightening his back and squaring his\nshoulders to the godstone. “Hold this room against any attack until I have\nreturned.”\nWithout a backward glance, Sedial strode through the glowing door into\nthe godstone.\nCHAPTER 67\nS\ntyke had to admit that the procession making its way down the main\navenue to the emperor’s palace was an impressive one. At its head were the\nMad Lancers—nearly four hundred heavy cavalry garbed in ancient armor,\nthe skull-and-lance flag fluttering over their heads. Behind them came the\nHousehold heads and their guards. Taking up the rear were the Adran\ncavalry Styke had borrowed from Flint what felt like years ago, still\ncommanded by Major Gustar. Everyone rode at attention, eyes keen,\nknowing that they were putting on a show for the palace.\nThe rest of the Mad Lancers, mostly recruits from their trek across\nFatrasta, kept the Dynize mob and their loyalist backers from bothering the\nprocession. Styke could hear the sounds of screaming and carbine shots\ncoming from all around them, and could see fighting across the lake. He\ntried to ignore it. He had a more important job to do.\nEven focusing on that was proving to be a challenge. Styke swayed in\nhis saddle, feeling light-headed from loss of blood. He hadn’t bothered to\ntell anyone about the wound in his side, and he wondered if that had been a\nmistake. The whole area screamed with each bounce of the saddle of his\nborrowed horse, and blood dripped down the side of his armor. He caught a\nfew concerned glances from the Lancers, but no one asked him about the\nwound.\nThe group reached the great gates of the palace complex, and Styke"

It had been built for show rather than to withstand a siege. The\nwalls couldn’t have been more than twenty feet high, the arch above the\ngate made out of wood instead of stone. Both arch and gate were brightly\npainted. Styke got the feeling that people weren’t supposed to actually\nattack the emperor. Something about sacrilege. He didn’t much care.\nAbove the wall, just a few blocks to his left, rose the godstone. The top\nof the pillar shone like the sun, causing walls and buildings to cast long\nshadows and forcing Styke to shade his eyes as he looked up to the silent\nrow of morion-helmed soldiers arrayed on the top of the wall. The soldiers\nwere dressed and armed just like any Dynize infantry or Household guard,\nbut they also wore full face masks painted in the same bright turquoise,\nyellows, greens, and blues as the palace gate.\n“I’m glad you’re here,” Styke said quietly to the Lancer beside him.\nIbana snorted. “Saved your life. Again.”\n“That you did.”\nShe must have heard something in Styke’s voice, because Ibana’s\nexpression softened and she reached over to touch her gauntlet to his. “I’m\nglad you’re still alive.”\nThey shared a companionable silence until Etzi joined them at the front\nof the column, riding out a few paces ahead with his Household standard\nflying above his horse. He called up to the imperial guard. “The Household\nQuorum demands an audience with the emperor. Open the gates!”\nOne of the guards removed his mask and leaned over the wall. “I see\nonly foreigners and traitors. The gates will remain closed. Disperse at\nonce.”\nEtzi cast Styke an uncertain glance. Styke said quietly to Ibana, “If they\nlet us in, I want you to figure out exactly how many soldiers are inside and\nput yourselves between them and Ka-poel.”\n“I get the feeling they’re not going to do that,” Ibana replied.\n“Then we’re going to gain the palace by force.”\n“Still want to know how many guard they have?”\n“We can count the corpses later.”\nIbana gave him a toothy grin. Another day, Styke might have returned it.\nHe touched his side and grimaced up at the imperial guard, who was still\nstaring arrogantly back down at Etzi. The Household head hesitated a few\nmoments and cleared his throat.\n“You see before you members of the Household Quorum and our allies.\nWe seek a peaceful resolution to what has occurred today. Open the gates so\nthat we may speak to the emperor. No one else has to die.”\nThe guard captain gestured dismissively. “You’ve had your warning.”\nStyke urged his horse up beside Etzi’s. “They’re not going to negotiate.”\n“Perhaps if we—”\nKa-poel rode up from the column and flashed a handful of signals at\nStyke.\nThey’re just buying time, Styke translated to Etzi. “She says we don’t\nhave hours to spare. We might not have minutes.”"

We might not have minutes.”\nEven now, after all that had occurred, it was clear Etzi was loath to order\nan attack on the imperial palace. Styke didn’t have the same reservations.\nHe nodded to Ibana, and she lifted her voice. “Open the gates or we will\nopen them for you!”\nA musket shot rang out, ricocheting off the cobbles just in front of Etzi’s\nhorse. A warning shot. They shouldn’t have bothered.\n“Go!” Styke snapped to Etzi, lowering his visor and putting himself\nbetween the wall and Ka-poel.\n“No?” Ibana boomed. “You heard ’em, boys! Tear down the gates!”\nA number of things happened at once. At Ibana’s order, the Lancers\nfanned out in front of the gate, each soldier producing a rope and grapple.\nThe imperial guard produced their muskets and opened fire, their bullets\nwhizzing around Styke’s head, pinging off his armor. Ka-poel produced her\nsatchel, flipping it open with one hand and raising the other into the air\nabove it. Tiny wax dolls appeared, floating around her head like wasps. One\nof the imperial guard suddenly turned on his companion with a bayonet.\nAnother produced a knife and disappeared. The shouting of the officers\nbecame desperate screams, and their hail of bullets was reduced to a\nsprinkle as they attempted to put down their own companions.\nDozens of Lancers threw their grapples over the gateway arch. The\nropes were secured to saddles and the horses began to strain. Ibana shouted\norders. More grapples were added. Styke watched the process silently,\nlistening to the fighting among the guards. He could smell the coppery bite\nof sorcery now, though he wasn’t sure whether it was coming from Ka-poel\nor the godstone. He took a few deep breaths, patting the neck of his\nborrowed horse.\nWith a final shout from Ibana, horses working in concert, the Lancers\nripped down the arch. One of the doors was torn clear off its hinges, while\nthe other screeched and bent at an angle, still holding on. Styke drew his\nsword. “Lancers, with me!”\nThey thundered into the palace, emerging into a wide parade ground and\nfanning out. There were at least two companies of imperial guard waiting\nfor them, and even with Ka-poel’s interference, the resistance was brutal.\nStyke felt the crunch of bodies beneath his horse’s chest armor and swung\nhis sword in a fury as bayonets surrounded him. For a moment he felt he\nwould be overwhelmed, but the sheer weight of the column riding in\nthrough the gate pushed back the Dynize and soon he was surrounded by\nhis own men. Horses fell to bayonets, men and animals screaming, as the\nMad Lancers took the gate.\nHe was suddenly free of the mob, his sword slick, gripping the saddle\nhorn to keep from falling to the ground. The chaos of the battle raged\naround him. He turned to find Ka-poel at his side. She slapped his armor\nand gestured emphatically. We have no time! This way! She suddenly"

She suddenly\ncharged through the melee, bent over her horse, machete in hand, galloping\nat speed with seemingly no thought for the danger. Styke had no choice but\nto follow.\nInstead of heading deeper into the palace, Ka-poel turned and rode\nparallel to the wall. They ducked beneath an arch, thundered down a long,\nnarrow corridor, and emerged into an enormous garden.\nKa-poel reined in and dismounted expertly. Styke did the same, holding\nhis side, sword in one hand. The garden was several acres—a pristine little\nslice of heaven with ponds, streams, decorative trees, flowers, and more.\nThe sound of the fighting, though Styke knew it was close, seemed miles\naway. His nose twitched at the fragrant smell of sorceries that he could not\nidentify but that presented a subtle undercurrent to the powerful reek of\nblood.\nThe godstone stood in the center of the garden. Vines grew around its\nbase like it was some old ruin, and the place might have been a perfect\npicture of peace were it not for the dozens of bodies stacked on the far side\nof the garden. An altar sat before the godstone, covered in blood, one final\ncorpse wearing the gloves of a Privileged sprawled across its center. A light\nhad appeared in the shape of a doorway just above the altar. Ka-poel strode\ntoward that light with purpose.\n“You cannot go that way,” a voice called.\nWhat Styke had initially taken for a corpse along the far wall suddenly\nstood up. It was a man in his forties, face and head shaved clean but with\nthe skin and features of a Palo. To Styke’s surprise, the man was at least as\ntall as him, if not taller. Black tattoos swirled around his wrists, bare chest,\nand neck, and his torso was covered in blood spatter. Even at this distance,\neven in the shadow of the godstone, the man smelled of sorcery. He\nwatched Ka-poel and Styke through bored, half-lidded eyes.\n“Why do you not obey me?” His voice was a deep rumble. “I am\nEmperor Janen. I am obeyed.”\nKa-poel’s hands flashed. Deal with him. Be careful. He is like Taniel.\n“What do you mean he’s like Taniel?” Styke asked.\nWithout answering, Ka-poel suddenly broke into a sprint, heading\nstraight for the godstone. Styke swore and did the same. Though they\nshould have beaten the emperor there by twenty paces, he crossed the space\nin the blink of an eye, one hand outstretched to snatch at Ka-poel. Styke\nflung his sword overhand and the emperor spun, batting it out of the air as if\nit were a lazily thrown ball.\nThe distraction allowed Styke several more strides, and when the\nemperor turned to grab Ka-poel, Styke slammed into him from the side. He\nput every ounce of strength into the tackle, and all the weight of his body\nand armor behind it. Janen fell beneath him, and they hadn’t even hit the\nground before Styke was drawing his knife.\nHe barely pulled it halfway from its sheath when he felt a palm connect"

Janen fell beneath him, and they hadn’t even hit the\nground before Styke was drawing his knife.\nHe barely pulled it halfway from its sheath when he felt a palm connect\nwith his chest. His breath was snatched from him, several of his ribs giving\na sickening crack that he felt from his fingertips to his toes. The blow sent\nhim reeling. Janen was on him in an instant, the emperor’s face marred by a\nmildly annoyed frown. Styke threw a punch with his left hand. Janen\ngrabbed his fist and almost casually gave a squeeze.\nEnsorceled steel bent under the strength. Styke felt a scream wrench\nitself from his mouth as his hand was crushed inside his gauntlet, pain\nlancing up his arm and making his knees weak. He fought through it and\njabbed with his now-drawn knife, catching the emperor under the ribs. The\ntip of Styke’s blade had barely pierced the skin when a backhand caught\nhim on the chin. He spun bodily, helpless to catch himself, and landed on\nhis back a dozen feet away, disoriented and in pain.\nJanen strode toward him, wearing that same irritated frown.\nStyke felt three of his teeth loose in his mouth. Blood poured from his\nlips. In all his life, he had never been manhandled by strength even a tenth\nof what the emperor had. He knew, in that instant, that he was going to die.\nBehind Janen, Ka-poel reached the altar and dove headfirst into the glowing\nlight. She disappeared in a wink.\nThe emperor inhaled sharply and spun toward the altar. Styke tried to lift\nhimself up, unsure whether Janen could follow Ka-poel through that door.\nHe had to keep the bastard distracted. But how?\nThe crack of a gun jolted Styke out of his painful half stupor. Janen\njerked, swatting at the back of his head as if stung by a bee. Styke craned\nhis head to look for the source of the shot, hoping to find Ibana or Jackal or,\npreferably, all of the Mad Lancers together. Instead he saw a man drop from\nthe outer wall and land on his feet as if the fall was nothing.\n“Is she inside?” Taniel demanded, discarding his smoking pistol.\n“She is,” Styke croaked. He spat out one of his teeth.\n“Then you’ve done your part. I’ll deal with Sedial’s creature.” Taniel\ndrew his sword and darted forward.\nCHAPTER 68\nM\nichel couldn’t remember the last time he really, truly cried. He’d cried\nin pain before, certainly. He’d wept over the deaths of his friends. But the\nsobs that wracked his body came out in horrid, anguished yowls, tearing his\nthroat raw. He clutched at Ichtracia, trying to regain control of himself, only\nhalf aware of the chaos around him.\nDragonmen and Privileged ran out of the keep. The doors were closed\nand barred.

Hundreds of people shouted in Dynize.\nMichel could not have said how long it had been since Sedial stepped\nthrough the portal, but there came a moment when he realized that he was\nno longer controlled. He held Ichtracia to his chest. He’d shifted onto his\nknees. The realization of sudden freedom broke through to him like a\nlightning strike and he wrestled down the sobs and wiped a grimy sleeve\nacross his eyes. He lowered Ichtracia back to the ground, tearing away her\nvest, pressing his palm to her chest wound to try to stem the flow of blood.\nHe’d missed her heart.\nBlood bubbled up through his fingers. He pressed harder, and Ichtracia\nsuddenly gurgled. Her eyes opened wide, the whites turned red from the\nmala used to drug her. A single bubble of blood appeared on her lips. It\npopped. Another formed, and he realized she was trying to speak.\n“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” His palm slipped\noff the wound. He tried to put it back, barely able to see through the hazy\nmist in his eyes.\nTo his shock, Ichtracia shifted in his arms. It was slow, gradual, and he\nmight not have felt it if he didn’t see her hand suddenly fall out of her\npocket. She was wearing one of her hidden gloves, still attached to her vest\nby several strings. The glove was black with blood. She tugged weakly,\ntrying to free the glove, then seemed to give up. Her body sagged. Michel\ntore the strings and clutched at her hand, pressing the gloved fingers against\nher own wound. “Come on! You can stop the bleeding!”\nMichel felt a firm hand suddenly grasp him by the shoulder. He was torn\naway from Ichtracia and turned toward a dragonman, who, staring down at\nMichel, seemed about to toss him aside. Michel tried to struggle, looking\nback toward Ichtracia. The other hand fell from her pocket, wearing a\nglove.\nThe tips of Ichtracia’s fingers twitched.\nA roar filled Michel’s ears. Heat pricked at his face like the embers of a\nfire, and he suddenly found himself unhanded. He wrapped his arms around\nhimself to try to stop his trembling as he was buffeted by unseen forces.\nWithin moments, nothing remained of Sedial’s guards. Soldiers,\ndragonmen, Privileged. At least two dozen people had been turned to ash in\nan instant. He let out a gasp and dropped back to his knees beside Ichtracia.\nHe patted her cheek, then checked her pulse. He could feel nothing.\nNo conscious thought propelled him forward. With a surge of strength,\nMichel scooped his arms beneath Ichtracia and lifted her to his chest.\nSlowly, one leg at a time, he got his feet beneath him. He hesitated, only for\na moment, staring at the unknown glow of oblivion. In two strides, he\nstepped through the portal and into the godstone.\nMichel stepped into a deafening silence.

Three glowing doors hovered in the air at a\nconstant distance from one another, providing something for Michel’s mind\nto grasp onto. Equidistant between them was a spot of the blackest black\nMichel had ever seen. It tugged at his eye, at once revolting and pleasing,\nhanging suspended above the ground. It couldn’t have been much bigger\nthan an apple.\nMichel took a step forward, trying to think through his disorientation.\nThere was something wrong with this place—something that pressed on the\nedges of his mind and flickered across his vision, yet he could not place it.\nIt took him several moments to realize that no color existed here, that he\ncould only see black, white, and gray. But that wasn’t what was driving him\nmad.\nHe took another step, trying to remember his purpose. Beneath his feet,\nthe brick felt spongy and loose. He smiled at the sensation, bouncing\nhimself up and down on the balls of his feet. He looked down at Ichtracia’s\nblood-soaked body. It seemed to weigh nothing. He couldn’t recall why he\nhad brought her here, or why he cared.\nIt took several more moments before he realized that they were not\nalone. Two figures stood on either side of the blackest black. They faced\neach other, their bodies frozen, their eyes locked. Michel could hear words,\nslow and muted, as if through a thick wall. He strained to hear them and in\nthe effort of that focus saw their lips moving.\n“You can’t waste it,” Ka-Sedial said.\nA faint flicker of surprise registered in the back of Michel’s head as Ka-\npoel answered him aloud, “And yet I won’t let you take it.”\n“You have no choice. It cannot be wasted,” Sedial replied. “We are here.\nThe power must be seized. Neither of us can imagine the consequences of\nleaving without it.” His frozen body seemed to lean forward ever so\nslightly. “You don’t have to oppose me, child. This rite of power is older\nthan Kresimir. Blood is meant to be spilled. It is meant to be used. We can\nshare it.” He moved closer to the blackest black.\nA bead of sweat rolled down Ka-poel’s brow and dripped from her chin.\n“I don’t need more power. I have no use for it.”\n“Everyone has a use for power.” Sedial moved backward a fraction of an\ninch. “You and I. We split it between us, as Kresimir split the power with\nhis siblings. We can do great things.” He trembled slightly, moving back\neven more.\nKa-poel’s eyes suddenly flicked toward Michel. In the flash of an instant\nhis warping reality seemed to stabilize, and he remembered the reason for\nthe tears on his cheeks. “You can’t be here!” Ka-poel told him. “It will kill\nyou!”\n“Your sister,” Michel gasped. “She…” He couldn’t finish, lifting\nIchtracia’s body with all his might, offering it toward Ka-poel. There was a\nflicker of hesitation in her eyes. Ka-Sedial suddenly surged forward, his\nfrozen body stopping within inches of the blackest black. A snarl crept onto"

A snarl crept onto\nhis lips, determination straining in his eyes. Something seemed to peel off\nthe tips of Ka-poel’s fingers—a shadow, floating, back and forth like a\nfeather, toward Michel. It landed softly on Ichtracia’s brow.\n“It’s all I can spare,” Ka-poel said, her voice trembling. “You have to go.\nYou will die.”\n“I’ll die with her, then,” Michel said. He could feel his mind slipping\nagain, that momentary control beginning to wane.\n“Let him die,” Sedial rasped. “Let them all die. Break free of your\nworldly cares. You can be a god, Ka-poel!” The old man’s fingers reached\nslowly toward the blackest black, as if moving through molasses.\nMichel’s reality began to unravel. Ichtracia slipped from his fingers,\nforgotten. His eyes locked on the blackest black. He wanted to walk toward\nit, but found that he could not. Something seemed to touch his collar.\nIchtracia lay in a pool of blood at his feet. She began to recede farther from\nhim, and he reached out to grasp her, but didn’t have the strength to do it.\nSomething—someone—was pulling him backward. He craned in confusion.\nLady Flint stood just inside the door through which Michel had entered.\nShe didn’t seem bothered by the room, her jaw set and her eyes steady.\n“You heard the woman,” she told him. “Out.”\nMichel felt himself flung toward the portal and watched helplessly as the\nroom with the blackest black disappeared. He stumbled onto the\nbloodstained altar in the fortress near Landfall. The room was filled with\nAdran soldiers, most of them badly wounded. Olem stood between a pair of\nPrivileged as one of them treated a gash in his forehead. Understanding\nreturned, and Michel threw himself back toward the portal, only to slam\nagainst rock. He pawed at the warm stone and let out a howl of grief.\nThe portal was gone.\nVlora tossed the spy back into the real world and turned to face the two\nfigures squared off over the blackest black. She walked toward them,\nfinding that the closer she drew, the harder it was to proceed. Halting her\nadvance, she walked around to one side where she could see both faces.\nThough they looked frozen, like fish on ice, her sorcerous senses screamed,\nalerting her to the unseen conflict raging between them. Her nostrils burned\nfrom powder, her body weak from all those injuries at the Crease.\n“You came,” Ka-poel suddenly said.\n“Chasing him.” Vlora nodded. “I didn’t expect to find you here.” She\ntried to take a step forward. It felt like stepping into a tub full of honey.\n“Lost half my army and a bunch of good friends to do it, but I’m here.\nWherever here is.

How man becomes god.”\n“Did Kresimir build this?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“Why isn’t he talking?” Vlora gestured at Ka-Sedial.\n“Because he’s not letting himself be distracted.” Ka-poel fell silent, the\nfrozen expression on her face slowly becoming a scowl. Both she and her\ngrandfather were sweating profusely. Sedial was closer to the blackest\nblack, his fingertips drifting toward it.\nVlora watched them struggle for a few more moments and stepped back,\ndrew her pistol, and fired.\n“Wait!” Ka-poel’s warning came too slow. The shot echoed through the\nroom. Vlora could see the bullet race toward Ka-Sedial’s head. But as it\ngrew closer, it too slowed, and the bullet came to a stop not an inch from his\ntemple. Ka-poel gave an angry grunt. “Attacking him won’t do any good.\nWe can manipulate this place to a point. That’s why you can’t come closer.”\nVlora glared at the offending bullet and drew her sword. “You’re certain\nabout that?”\nKa-poel didn’t answer, but Vlora saw Sedial’s eyes flicker toward her as\nshe began to wade through the honey-like air, her blade extended. She\nthought she heard a distant rumble, disturbing the silence of the room.\n“You shouldn’t be here,” Sedial suddenly spoke up.\n“Neither should you,” Vlora retorted. She took a hit of powder—too\nmuch, more than she should dare in her fragile state—and pushed forward.\n“This is my birthright!” Sedial snapped. “This is my power to take. You\nhave no place here, powder mage. You can look into the Else, but you\ncannot enter.”\nVlora felt herself buffeted by… something. Ka-poel moved slightly\ntoward the blackest black, Sedial twitched away from it. Vlora continued to\npush her weakened body, summoning from the well deep within her—all\nher anger, her frustration, her determination. She extended her arm,\nplunging her sword toward Sedial’s throat, like trying to push the blade\nthrough the center of a tree. The metal began to bend, and Sedial’s fingers\nregained their lost ground in his reach for the blackest black.\n“Nobody wants you as their god,” Vlora hissed.\n“No one gets to choose their god,” Sedial said. He suddenly lurched to\none side, shaking his head in confusion. His fingers slipped past the\nblackest black, and the bullet suspended in air continued along its path,\nwhizzing past his ear and smacking into the far wall in a puff of plaster.\nVlora’s own body was released, the force of her own momentum carrying\nher past Sedial.

How’s Davd?”\nA medic appeared through the doors of the keep, hands covered in\nblood, and answered the question with the shake of his head.\nOlem swore. “Listen up, everyone! We’re down to one powder mage\nand one Privileged. Our field guns are knackered and the Dynize seem\npretty pissed off that we’ve captured their damned obelisk. I’m not sure if\nwe can hold this position, but we’re damn well going to try. The good news\nis our fleet has arrived and shelled the living piss out of everything the\nDynize had holding the harbor, which gives us a corridor of retreat and\nrelief. I want all wounded evacuated in that direction. Get to it!”\nThe orders were followed within moments, wounded being loaded into\nstretchers while reinforcements took to the fortress walls with their rifles.\nMichel watched it all with a dense numbness, wondering if he should\nfollow them toward Landfall. Even getting down from the altar seemed like\nan impossible task. Maybe it was fitting that he should stay here and die\nwhen the Dynize recaptured the fort.\n“Michel!”\nHe jumped, realizing that Olem stood directly in front of him. “Huh?\nSir?”\n“You’ve lost a lot of blood, soldier. You should get out of here.”\nMichel shook his head and pulled his mangled hand closer to his chest.\n“I’m not leaving without Ichtracia.”\n“That’s a bold thing to say, but you’re only going to get in the way.”\n“I’m not leaving.”\n“Pit. Well, I’m giving Vlora five more minutes and then requesting\nvolunteers to hold the keep and sending everyone else to fight their way\ntoward the coast. If you want to die with those of us that stay, you’re more\nthan welcome to do so.” Olem abruptly turned and shouted at a messenger,\nstriding away to a flurry of reports.\nMichel lifted his eyes to the godstone, willing that portal to reappear.\nOnly blank stone stared back at him. He felt himself tilting, his head foggy.\nThe practical spy within him formulated a plan to retreat with the Adrans,\nmake use of their medics, then get himself to a hideaway within the\ncatacombs where he could recover through whatever was to follow this\nbattle. He squeezed his eyes shut and scooted off the edge of the altar,\ngaining his feet. There was no point in remaining. He’d done all he could\ndo.\nA popping sound, like a rifle going off behind his ear, made him jump.\nHe spun back toward the godstone only to see that a great crack had\nformed, running lengthwise all the way up and down the monument. The\nwhole thing shifted, and half of it looked like it was about to fall but, at the\nlast moment, settled in on its own weight. Michel was so transfixed by the\nbreak that he almost missed the two figures who’d appeared on the altar."

Michel was so transfixed by the\nbreak that he almost missed the two figures who’d appeared on the altar.\nVlora and Ichtracia leaned against each other, their clothes steaming.\nMichel felt himself brushed aside as Olem rushed to the altar and helped\nVlora down. The two leapt into a conference, and within moments Vlora\nwas ordering a fighting retreat from the godstone. The Adrans began to pick\nup their things, ready to leave now that their general had returned.\nMichel wanted to rush to Ichtracia, but it was all he could do to stay\nstanding as she came to join him. She was covered in blood, still wearing\nher gloves, her vest hanging loose to reveal that the great wound he’d given\nher under Sedial’s influence was healed without a scar. He could tell from\nthe slump of her shoulders that she was in pain, and her eyes still held the\nredness of a deep mala binge.\n“You look as bad as I feel,” she said.\n“That good?” Michel swayed, seeing darkness at the corners of his\nvision. “I’m glad you’re back.”\n“Michel?”\nHer voice sounded distant. Michel’s head felt heavy, and he abruptly\ndropped to his knees, casting about for a soft spot to sit. “I’m just going to\nlie down for a while,” he told her. “Sorry I stabbed you.”\nCHAPTER 69\nS\ntyke leaned against a tree in the godstone garden and worked to remove\nhis ruined gauntlet. From his teeth to his toes, everything hurt. It was as if\nhe’d been hit by a runaway mule cart, and he still couldn’t quite grasp just\nhow easily the emperor had manhandled him. The supernatural strength was\nbeyond anything he’d ever witnessed.\nAcross the garden, at the base of the godstone, Taniel and the emperor\ntore into each other like two fighting cockerels. The emperor had snatched\nup his own sword. Both men were obviously trained duelists. Their\nmovements were a blur, their hands darting like hummingbirds, their\nfootwork raising a cloud of dust around them. Even for someone like Styke,\nwho had watched and participated in fights his entire life, it was difficult to\ntell what, exactly, was happening.\nIt was clear, however, that Taniel was not winning. Blood soaked his\nface and shirt, rivulets of dirty sweat trickling down his neck. The emperor\nfought with a look of focus, and not a single sword stroke marred his bare\nchest.\nStyke gasped as the gauntlet finally came off. He dropped it to the\nground and examined his hand. His left and ring fingers were likely broken.\nThe other three seemed to work, and the hand itself was undamaged. He\ndiscarded the ruined gauntlet, trying to catch his breath, wondering how\nmany ribs were cracked and how much blood he’d lost.\nA shout tore his eyes off the duel and made him peer around the tree\nagainst which he’d been resting. A door leading into the palace complex had\nopened not far from where he’d entered, and a group of soldiers in their\nimperial garb and lacquered masks emerged from within. There were seven\nin total, and they froze in wonder at their emperor battling the Kressian\nstranger."

There were seven\nin total, and they froze in wonder at their emperor battling the Kressian\nstranger.\nTheir pause only lasted a few moments. One barked to the others, and\nthey began to jog toward the godstone, loosening swords and checking their\npistols. Styke felt his head sag in painful exhaustion.\nSummoning what reserves he could find deep within himself, he limped\nalong behind a screen of bushes, coming up on the line of guardsmen at an\nangle, reaching them just a few moments before they reached his borrowed\nhorse. He lurched out from behind the bushes and slammed his right\ngauntlet in between the eyes of their leader, dropping him like a stone, then\ndrew his knife.\nThe guardsmen were not dragonmen, but that was where Styke’s\nfortunes ended. The fall of their leader seemed to barely faze them, and five\nof them fanned out while the closest to Styke leapt toward him with sword\ndrawn.\nStyke caught the swing on his left vambrace and jabbed with his knife.\nEven as his counterstroke skidded off the guard’s ceremonial armor and\nsank into the flesh just below his arm, Styke knew he was moving too\nslowly. A pistol shot went off to his side, and he felt the rattle of a bullet\nhitting one of his pauldrons. A quick, shouted exchange took place between\nthe remaining guards as he attempted to pull his blade out of their\ncompanion. Someone stepped up to Styke’s side, and before he could react,\nthe butt of a pistol cracked him on the temple.\nThe blow would have dropped a lesser man. As it was, Styke stumbled\nback, stunned, stars floating across his vision. He might have fallen if his\nback had not come in contact with a tree. He let it take his weight, grateful\nfor the moment of rest, and blinked hard to try to clear his swimming\nvision.\nA scream issued from somewhere nearby, attracting the attention of his\nassailants. Styke took the opportunity to spit blood into the face of the\nclosest guard and fall forward among them, knife swinging. It was sloppy\nwork, but he managed to drop two before the other three withdrew. He\nstumbled after them, knife cutting a graceless arc in the air, grumbling\ncurses at their backs.\nHe found another tree to take his weight and turned to look after his\nretreating opponents, only to discover that he’d gotten mixed up in the\nmelee. He was no longer between them and their emperor, and they’d\nchosen to leave him to go help their ward.\nThe scream, it seemed, had come from the emperor. His face was torn\nopen from brow to chin, a neat, bloody gash cut through his nose and lips.\nDespite the wound, he seemed to have doubled his efforts, backing a\nvindicated-looking Taniel toward the corner of the garden.\nStyke’s opponents didn’t reach their emperor. The crack of firearms tore\nthrough the air behind Styke, and all three men collapsed in a hail of\nbullets. Styke whirled, nearly losing his balance, to find a line of\ndismounted Lancers and Household guards just inside the grotto, their\nweapons smoking. Ibana emerged into the garden behind them, followed\nclosely by Etzi."

Ibana emerged into the garden behind them, followed\nclosely by Etzi.\nIbana’s measured pace was doubled when she laid eyes on Styke. She\njogged over to him, her armor rattling, and ducked beneath his shoulder.\n“By Adom, Ben, you look like death!”\n“I’m fine.” He tried to wave her off.\n“What the pit happened to your hand?”\nHe gestured toward the emperor. “Him.”\nEtzi and his Household guards watched the duel with eyes wide. No one\nmoved to interfere. “The emperor,” Etzi said in an awed whisper, “has been\ngiven strength by the bone-eyes. We found one of them just in the main\nhall, face withered, barely able to stand. The emperor must be drawing\npower off of them in incredible amounts. Who is that man, and how is he\nable to fight the might of the imperial cabal?”\n“That,” Styke said, “is Ka-poel’s husband.”\n“Incredible,” Etzi breathed, “but still, he cannot win, not against—”\nWhatever he was about to say was cut off by a crack that cut the air in\ntwo. It was as if a cannon had gone off in the garden, and everyone around\nStyke flinched away from the sound. All eyes were drawn to the godstone.\nA new crack ran, jagged and splintering, from base to capstone. On the\naltar, clothes smoking, were two figures.\nKa-poel stood like an avenging angel, head held high, ignoring the old\nman on his knees in front of her. She grasped him by the nape of the neck\nand threw him forward, off the altar, where he gave a pitiful cry and curled\nup into a ball.\nIn that moment Taniel suddenly surged forward, batting aside the\nemperor’s sword and plunging his own blade two-handed into the\nemperor’s sternum. The emperor gasped loudly and backpedaled toward the\ngodstone. Somehow, despite two feet of steel through his chest, he\nremained standing. It wasn’t until he finally turned toward the godstone and\nhis eyes fell upon Ka-poel—and then the old man at his feet—that he\nfinally teetered. Blood dripping from his lips, the emperor of Dynize\ncollapsed.\n“Leave him!” Ka-poel snapped. The sound brought a halt to Etzi and the\nHousehold guards, who had begun to rush toward their fallen emperor. It\nalso elicited a look of surprise from Taniel. “Finish destroying the imperial\nguard,” Ka-poel ordered. She gestured at the old man at her feet. “Then\nbring him and any survivors to the throne room. We have much to discuss.”\nStyke felt light-headed and dizzy. He began to chuckle.\n“What’s so funny?” Ibana demanded.\nStyke continued to laugh until it hurt. He clutched his side, nearly\nsticking himself with his own knife. “She went in there looking for a god\nand came back out with a voice.”\nIt took over an hour for the Lancers and the Household guards working\ntogether to clear the imperial complex.

Messengers were sent in every\ndirection with the intent of halting further violence, but even after that hour\nStyke could still hear the crack of carbines or the occasional clash of swords\nsomewhere off within the complex grounds.\nBeyond the walls, Talunlica continued to burn as mobs and soldiers\nraged back and forth across the city.\nThe imperial throne room was a long, high-ceilinged chamber made of\nbrightly painted wood, lit by gas lanterns along both sides and gas\nchandeliers hanging at intervals. The flags of several hundred Households\nflew from the rafters, marching their way up to the very throne itself, which\nwas a single piece of red stone carved into the likeness of twin swamp\ndragons.\nThe room was filled with spectators: wounded Lancers and Household\nguards, captured imperial soldiers and bureaucrats. The Household heads\nwho had accompanied them stood in close conference with Ka-poel and\nTaniel near the throne. Styke rested his head against the wall off to one side,\njust trying to keep from falling over. Maetle had given him a splint for his\nfingers and bandages for his side, but he could tell from Ibana’s worried\nglances that he looked like he was knocking on death’s door. He was weak\nwith blood loss, his armor covered in blood.\nSomeone called for attention. Styke opened his eyes, realizing he’d been\ndozing on his feet, and lifted his head toward the throne. The Household\nheads, Etzi among them, left the dais to take up positions at the front of the\ncrowd. Styke watched their faces, curious at the various reactions: hope,\njoy, confusion. Fear.\nOnly Ka-poel and Taniel remained on the dais. They waited until the\nHousehold heads were in their places and then Ka-poel took up a position\njust in front of the throne. Taniel joined her.\nEveryone’s attention was on Ka-poel. No one spoke. No one even\nseemed to breathe.\n“Where is my grandfather?” she suddenly asked.\nA few moments passed before a pair of Lancers dragged in the old man\nwhom she’d brought with her through the godstone. The resemblance was\nuncanny, but Styke had somehow expected more from the Great Ka. Sedial\nseemed unharmed, but everything about him was broken: His face was pale,\nhis eyes empty, his mouth hanging slack. He was left to sit on the top step\nof the dais, staring blankly at the floor. A line of drool dripped from his\nchin.\nKa-poel looked down at him for some time, leaving the entire hall in\nbreath-bated silence. Her lip curled. Her eyes narrowed. She finally sniffed\nand took a deep breath.\n“The emperor is dead,” she said. Her voice carried clearly, echoing off\nevery corner of the room. “The Great Ka has been driven mad by what he\nsaw in the godstone. The imperial cabal will take a century to recover from\nthe losses they’ve incurred from this war, and the mighty armies of Dynize\nhave been reduced by hundreds of thousands.\n“You have nothing,” she continued. “You are a divided country with\nbroken ideals and a shattered reputation that will not survive the modern\nworld. Many of your greatest Households have been destroyed this very day"

Many of your greatest Households have been destroyed this very day\nby the machinations of Ka-Sedial. You have nothing… except me.\n“I don’t want to be your god. But it was either me or him.” She nudged\nSedial with one toe. “I will not answer prayers. I will not perform miracles.\nBut I will be your goddess—your empress—and I will help you put back\ntogether the pieces of this shattered land. You’ve got what the Great Ka\npromised you. You’ve got a new god. Will you accept me?”\nThe final question was almost timid in its asking, entirely different from\nthe tone of the rest of her speech. Styke was certain that if the assembled\nHouseholds said no, she would leave them all without a second thought.\nThe question left an ominous silence, which continued for over a\nminute, and then two. Slowly, one by one, the Household heads began to\nkneel. They were followed by a wave of every Dynize in the room, from the\nHousehold guards to their prisoners. Only the present Lancers, still wearing\ntheir armor, most of them wounded and slick with gore, remained on their\nfeet. They looked toward Styke. As did Ka-poel and Taniel.\n“Colonel Ben Styke,” Ka-poel intoned, “I would like the Mad Lancers to\nform an imperial guard for my new government. Will you carry our\nstandard below your own?”\nBelow. The word punched a laugh out of Styke’s belly, one so hard that\nhe almost fell over from the pain. He wiped tears from the corners of his\neyes. “You’re already very good at this, my little blood-witch friend.”\nSeveral of the Household heads inhaled sharply. Ka-poel smirked.\n“Even being a god, I imagine there will be a lot of cleaning up to do,”\nStyke continued. “There will be a lot of violence.”\n“There will,” she agreed.\nStyke glanced at Ibana. She just shrugged. He said, “I’ll think about it.\nI’ll have to consult the men.”\n“Can I heal your wounds?” Ka-poel asked. Her tone was gentle.\n“You’re a Privileged now?”\n“No. I’m something different.”\n“Ah. Good for you. Will I die from these wounds?”\n“I don’t believe so.”\nStyke considered the offer. He was no stranger to sorcerous healing, but\nhe could feel his own stubbornness taking hold in his gut. He was no man to\nfeel beholden to a god. “A little pain is good for a man,” he finally said,\npulling himself away from the wall. He limped to the center of the throne\nroom and turned his back on Ka-poel, walking slowly toward the exit. He\nheard Etzi’s voice hiss behind him.\n“Where are you going?” Etzi demanded. “You’re witnessing the birth of\na god!”\n“Gods,” Styke replied, waving him off. “Emperors. Countries. Bah. I’m\ngiving the order for the Mad Lancers to regroup and await new commands,\nthen I’m going to find my daughter.”\nM\nichel had done a lot of insane things in his life—he’d manipulated"

Despite all of this, he had never before been as\nnervous as he was as the riverboat delivered him and Ichtracia directly to a\nsmall launch off the side of the imperial palace in Talunlica.\nHe’d tried to marvel at the city to keep himself distracted. It really was\nan incredible place, one that he knew he’d enjoy touring at length, but even\nhis arrival in a country that had been closed off to outsiders for a hundred\nyears did nothing to pull his mind away from the coming meeting. He tried\nrehearsing what he’d say. He played games in his head. He read books.\nNothing seemed to work.\nThe dock was not a large one, mostly taken up by large, brightly colored\nvessels in the purple and turquoise of the imperial household. Their\nriverboat slid into the one open spot, porters jumping out to secure the boat\nand then unload the luggage in a flurry of activity. Despite all the\nstrangeness of this place, the pair waiting to meet them were a familiar\nsight, one that took the edge off Michel’s nerves.\nTaniel Two-shot stood with his hands clasped behind his back. He wore\nthe flowing-cut jacket and pants of a Dynize uniform, but with the Adran\nblue and silver-and-crimson trim in contrast to all the turquoise around\nthem. At his side was a tall figure in ancient-looking armor. The visor was\nopen to reveal a scarred, hard-faced Kressian woman. He didn’t recognize\nher, but he did recognize the skull-and-lance insignia attached to her left\npauldron.\nOne of the porters gestured for them to come ashore, and Michel looked\nat Ichtracia. Her expression was cool, unreadable, and arrogant, but when\nshe squeezed the tips of his fingers gently, he could feel that she was\ntrembling. Taniel stepped forward to offer her his hand, which she accepted.\nMichel followed.\n“Ichtracia, Michel. It’s good to see you again. This is Ibana je Fles, the\ncaptain of the imperial guard. Sorry that Ka-poel isn’t here to meet you.\nOne of her audiences has run long, but she’ll end it the moment she knows\nyou’re in the palace.”\nPleasantries were exchanged, and they followed Taniel along the dock\nand into the palace. Michel lagged behind, considering their surroundings,\ntrying to work through his nerves. They were getting worse with every step.\nTaniel didn’t seem to notice, talking while they walked. “I’m glad you\nwere able to make it so quickly. I’m sure everything between here and in\nFatrasta is still in absolute chaos.”\n“You have no idea,” Ichtracia replied. “Peace is still holding, but\neveryone who doesn’t have orders to remain in Landfall is trying to get\nback here. They’re terrified of what will happen to them if things break\ndown, now that the armies are leaving.”\nIt had only been two months since the end of hostilities, and if anything,"

        "text": "back here. They’re terrified of what will happen to them if things break\ndown, now that the armies are leaving.”\nIt had only been two months since the end of hostilities, and if anything,\nIchtracia was playing down the uncertainty and panic of everyone who’d\nbeen involved in the war. When she and Michel left, Landfall had felt like a\npowder keg, with the Palo, Kressians, and Dynize all sitting on the knife’s\nedge, wondering what would happen now that Dynize had a new empress.\nMichel wondered if he should speak up, but rejected the thought. Taniel\nwould no doubt corner him later for a full debriefing. Besides, this was no\nlonger his place. He wasn’t a Privileged or a relative or a politician or\nanyone important. He was just another spy without orders.\nThey walked through the long, high-ceilinged palace corridors. Servants\nseemed to flutter everywhere, always on Michel’s periphery but never\ncrossing their paths. They reached a junction at which Ibana was called\naway by a soldier. Michel watched her go, and finally spoke up.\n“Wasn’t she Ben Styke’s second-in-command?”\nTaniel nodded.\n“So the Mad Lancers really did invade Dynize all on their own?”\n“Accompanying Ka-poel, yes.” Taniel chuckled. He looked older than\nhe’d been, but significantly less tired. “Once Ka-poel seized the throne, we\noffered the Mad Lancers a place at Ka-poel’s side.” He paused thoughtfully.\n“Styke turned us down. Ibana did not.”\n“He turned her down?” Ichtracia asked, dumbfounded. “You don’t turn\ndown honors from the empress of Dynize!”\n“I think,” Taniel said, “that Ka-poel is going to be a different kind of\nruler than your people are used to, for both good and ill. Besides, it\nwouldn’t have mattered who made the offer. Styke wasn’t interested. He…\ngot something else for our gratitude, though.”\nThey rounded another corner, and Ichtracia suddenly came to a stop.\nThere, at the other end of the hall, surrounded by a small entourage, was\nKa-poel. Ka-poel wore a uniform much like Taniel’s, but colored with the\npurple and turquoise with accents that matched his Adran colors. She raised\na hand to cut off someone who’d been speaking with her, then made a sharp\ngesture. The entourage scattered.\nA few seconds of silence followed, and the two sisters ran toward each\nother, falling into a long embrace. To Michel’s surprise, they began talking\nalmost immediately. He stared, dumbfounded. “She can talk?” he asked\nTaniel.\nTaniel watched the reunion with a small smile. “Something she gained\nwhen she went into the godstone to oppose Sedial. We have no idea how or\nwhy.”\n“Is she…” Michel swallowed. “Is she really a god?”\nTaniel glanced at him sidelong. “What have you heard?”\n“Only a few rumors since we arrived. The Dynize here are whispering\nabout it, but we didn’t find out anything about it in Fatrasta.”\n“It’s… complicated.”\n“That’s not a no.”\n“There was a lot of power in those godstones, enough to make many"

Ka-poel took some of it. The rest, well… she used the rest to destroy\nthe godstones themselves. We’re hoping that’s enough to seal the Else away\nforever.”\n“I see.” Michel regarded Ichtracia and Ka-poel warily, his stomach tying\nitself in knots.\n“Is something wrong?” Taniel asked with a frown.\n“I’m out of my element,” Michel demurred. “In more ways than one.”\nHe tried to ignore the concerned glance that Taniel cast him. “So, if Pole is\nthe new empress, then what are you?”\n“I’m her consort,” Taniel answered.\n“Not the emperor?”\nHe sniffed and shook his head. “That would be neither politically\nexpedient nor something I desire. I don’t need power or responsibilities. I’d\nfar rather stand behind her than beside her. It frees me up to protect her\nfrom everyone in this damned country who is angry she seized power.”\n“Isn’t she immortal now?”\n“Maybe? Maybe not. We’re not going to test it. For now, we’re going to\nstitch the country back together—to unite them, open the borders, and bring\nthem into the modern age. Once that’s done”—he shrugged—“we hope to\nreach a point at which Dynize doesn’t need a monarch and we can just\ndisappear.”\n“That sounds ideal.”\n“There’s a lot of work to do between now and then. You’ll be pleased to\nknow we’ve already opened up conversations with the Palo in Landfall. We\nhave a lot of leverage over Lindet, and we’re going to use it to make sure\nshe changes the way the Palo are treated.”\n“I’m very glad to hear that,” Michel replied. When he and Ichtracia left\nLandfall, Jiniel had already sent messengers directly to Ka-poel. He had\nhigh hopes.\n“Speaking of which…” Taniel trailed off as the two sisters finally came\nto join them. Ka-poel beamed openly. Ichtracia was more guarded, her\nexpression fit for the People-Eater that the palace servants had expected to\nreturn, but she clutched her older sister’s hand so tightly that both their\nfingers turned white. Taniel nodded to Ka-poel. “Should we get this over\nwith?”\nKa-poel greeted Michel with a small smile, and his nerves almost set\nhim shaking. He interjected before she could say anything. “Look, I’m not\nsure if I belong here. If you can point me somewhere out of the way, I’ll let\nyou two…” He trailed off. “Get what over with?”\n“It’s good to see you, Michel,” Ka-poel said. She sounded so much like\nIchtracia that it was uncanny.\nMichel looked between her and Taniel, wondering what they were up to.\nHe gave a half bow. “Empress.”\n“Oh, stop that. You can be formal in public because it’s expected, but not\nwithin the palace grounds.” Ka-poel took a deep breath and exchanged a\nsmirk with her husband. “Michel and Ichtracia, we have tasks for you, if"

Ichtracia, I’d like you to become the magus of my new\nimperial cabal. Michel, I want you to be the imperial spymaster. I can think\nof no two people I’d rather have at my back.”\nFor her part, Ichtracia seemed to absorb the news as if she expected it.\nMichel felt his mouth fall open. “You’re joking?”\n“Of course not,” Ka-poel said, looking vaguely annoyed. “Why would I\njoke about that?”\n“I…” Michel sucked on his teeth and took a deep breath. He finally got\na grasp on his nerves, pulling them all tight until he could talk without a\ntremble in his voice. He made eye contact with Ichtracia. Only a moment\nago she had exclaimed that one does not turn down honors from the ruler of\nDynize. “Does this change that thing we’d discussed?”\n“Not for me it doesn’t. Does it for you?”\n“No.”\nIt seemed to be Taniel and Ka-poel’s turn to be confused. They both\nwatched Michel with a sudden trepidation. Michel kept his eyes on\nIchtracia for a few more moments before turning to her sister. God,\nempress, or simply his former employer—he could do this. “Ichtracia and I\nare getting married. We want to spend a few months here, but then we’ve\nbeen invited to visit the Palo Nation in northern Fatrasta and we figure that\nwould be a good place for both of us, where no one knows nor cares who\nwe are.”\n“Oh.” The response came from Taniel and Ka-poel at the same time.\nMichel bit his tongue. He was going to marry the sister of the new Dynize\nempress. He should be asking for permission, not telling them. But Ichtracia\nhad made it clear that she was no one’s property anymore. If he hadn’t told\nthem, she would have. He braced himself, waiting for the rebuke to come.\nThe silence was just beginning to get awkward when Ka-poel suddenly\ngrinned. “Congratulations! That’s… not what I expected.”\nStill as stone-faced as ever, Ichtracia slipped away from her sister and\ntook Michel’s hand. “We’ve spent a lot of time together this last year. We’d\nlike to spend more, and without responsibilities.”\n“I think we can understand that,” Taniel said. “It doesn’t mean we won’t\ntry to talk you into something. An ambassadorship, maybe?” He pressed on,\nbefore either of them felt the need to answer. “It doesn’t matter. We have\nplenty of time to discuss it. I made sure the palace chancellor cleared out\nPole’s schedule for the day. Shall we go find lunch?”\nMichel felt all the nerves that had turned his body into a twisted bundle\nthese last couple of weeks finally relax. His legs felt spongy, but his chest\nfelt light. “That sounds great. You can help me convince Ichtracia to agree\nto meet my mother when we go back through Fatrasta.”\nV\nlora stood on the ramparts of Fort Nied, staring at the Landfall Plateau,\nwhich rose sharply above her, wondering if she would ever see the city"

        "text": "V\nlora stood on the ramparts of Fort Nied, staring at the Landfall Plateau,\nwhich rose sharply above her, wondering if she would ever see the city\nagain. It was a strange thought, at once somber and relieving. What had\nbegun with her landing not far from this spot for some light mercenary\nwork to get her out of Adro for a few years had ended with her fighting two\nmajor battles at the city, clashing with a dictator and a wannabe god, and\ngetting thousands of her soldiers killed.\nShe’d made her mark on Fatrasta, and Fatrasta, for good or ill, had\ndamned well made its mark on her.\n“Lady Flint!” a voice called up at her from within the fort. “We’ll need a\ndecision in thirty minutes, ma’am!”\nVlora acknowledged the warning with a raised hand, her gaze still lifted\nto the Landfall. Six months after the end of what people had taken to calling\nthe Godstone War, the city was a shadow of its former self. Piles of rubble\nstill remained of buildings destroyed in the initial Dynize shelling,\nalongside the burned-out husks of those torched during the Palo uprising\nthat accompanied the climax of the war. Despite all the destruction still\nevident, there was new growth to be seen if one knew where to look: the\nskeletons of new construction, fresh-faced buildings only just finished, and\nthe thick traffic of a population finally trickling back to their homes.\nVlora pulled her thoughts away from Landfall and turned her eyes\ntoward the harbor, where two ships lay at anchor. One of them was a big,\npowerful, clumsy ship with black sails—closer to a floating palace than to a\ntrue ship of the line. It had brought with it a number of Dynize diplomats\nand fresh correspondents from the new Dynize empress less than a week\nago. The other ship was small and fast, a Rosvelean-built vessel flying\nAdran colors.\nBoth ships had orders to sail to their countries of origin with the next\noutgoing tide.\n“Vlora?”\nVlora lifted her head from her contemplations and turned toward the\nstairs, where Olem had appeared. He paused briefly, cigarette smoke\nstreaming from his nostrils, then ashed his cigarette and joined her.\n“Still haven’t decided?” he asked.\nVlora shook her head. “Are the last of the coffins on board the Adran\nship?”\n“They are,” he answered.\n“Davd and Sabastenien?”\n“It’ll be a good trip for them. The captain assures me that none of the\ncoffins will slide around.”\n“Good. I… I still wonder if I did the right thing.”\n“We all wonder that,” Olem responded.\n“That I did the right thing?”\n“Each of us wonder about ourselves,” he amended.\n“I was joking.”\nOlem snorted and leaned over to give her a peck on the cheek before\nlighting a new cigarette. “You’re going to have to decide. You have twenty-\nfive minutes before our luggage has to be loaded into one of those ships.”\nVlora pulled a pair of letters from her jacket, opened them both, then\nspread them on the ramparts, using one hand to smooth the folds.

        "text": "Vlora pulled a pair of letters from her jacket, opened them both, then\nspread them on the ramparts, using one hand to smooth the folds. On the\nleft was a letter from Taniel, inviting her and Olem to visit the court of the\nnew Dynize empress. On the right was a letter from the government of\nAdro, demanding that Vlora return to Adro to answer for getting Adran\nsoldiers involved in a foreign war.\nShe considered that second letter. Most of her soldiers had gone home\nmonths ago, accompanying Bo, Nila, and the fleet. This was, after all, no\nlonger an Adran matter. Their army was dissolved, the matter put to rest.\nThey had won. Vlora had stopped a would-be god.\nShe hadn’t told anyone but Olem about that moment in the Else, when\nKa-poel seized that blackest of black. None of the new “empress’s”\ncorrespondents had referred to her godhood. She wondered how long until\nthe news got out—how long until her compatriots back home found out that\nshe had, in fact, failed in her mission.\nShe wondered if Ka-poel was equipped for godhood, or if a new\nnightmare had been born.\n“If we go home,” she told Olem, “there is a distinct possibility that we\nwill both be arrested and court-martialed. Delia has been there for four\nmonths, putting her own spin on what happened here, no doubt telling\neveryone that you murdered Provost Marshal Valeer in cold blood.”\nIf the prospect of facing a trial bothered Olem, it didn’t show on his\nface. “Bo and Nila have both been back for a couple of months, as well as\nmost of the general staff. After Delia’s betrayal, they won’t let her lies\nstand.”\n“And yet our arrest is still a possibility.”\nOlem tapped his finger on the letter from Adro. “It is,” he conceded.\n“We could go to Dynize. Taniel has as much promised you a letter of\nrecommendation, an ambassadorship, and the full protection of the Dynize\nthrone.”\n“And it would give us a chance to see what Ka-poel has really become,”\nVlora mused.\n“Last I heard, Major Gustar is still hanging around there to make sure\nAdro has some representation in the Dynize court until a proper ambassador\narrives. It would be good to see him.”\nVlora looked from one letter to the other, then back again. A war raged\nin her chest as she considered the possibilities of both, the benefits and the\ndangers. There were too many to name. The idea of returning to Adro and\nfacing a country that had made it clear it didn’t want its war heroes around\nanymore was terrifying. The possibility of conflict—of putting her talents to\nuse in Dynize—had a certain allure.\n“You support whichever decision I make?” she asked Olem, though\nshe’d asked him the same a dozen times in the last few days.\n“I do.”\nShe picked up the letter from Dynize, folded it, and placed it back in her\npocket. “No more running from home,” she told him, taking the other letter\nand handing it to him. “I have a story to tell in Adro, and I’m going to tell it,"

God or not, it’s going to take her years to repair\nDynize. I think I’ve earned time to deal with more personal matters.\nBesides.” She frowned, thinking back to those few minutes in the Else.\n“Adom was there, and he did not stop her. I have the feeling things are\ngoing to work out.”\n“Right. I suppose we can ask him in person in a couple of months.”\nOlem offered her his arm. “Well, my Lady Flint. Will you accompany me to\nour ship?”\nShe hooked her arm into his. “Gladly.”\nS\ntyke watched a tree fall, listening to the satisfying snap of limbs as it\ngained speed in its descent and finally crunched to the ground with a sound\nthat echoed throughout the forest. He took a deep breath, wiping sweat from\nhis brow, and shouldered his ax. His left hand hurt terribly, the fingers that\nEmperor Janen broke still aching on cool days, and his side decidedly\ntender after so much hard labor.\nBut both pains were good ones. They reminded him that he was alive,\nbut mortal.\nStyke proceeded to strip the tree of all its branches—a job that took him\nseveral hours. By the time he was finished, it was getting near noon and\nCeline had joined him, setting up two armies of carved cavalry on the\nnearby stump of a tree he’d felled last week. Styke watched her play with\nthe two warring forces for a few moments, then fetched a reinforced leather\nstrap. Wrapping the strap around the trunk of the tree, then around his\nshoulders, Styke dragged the trunk across the soft ground until he’d\nremoved it from the area that would be, one of these days, his new house\nand yard.\n“You know we have horses, right, Ben?” Celine called from her play.\nStyke reached his destination and dropped it, letting it roll down a slight\nincline toward a pile of other trunks. “No need to use a horse for what a\nman can do on his own.”\nA sudden neigh caught Styke’s attention, turning his gaze away from his\nown horse pen and toward the forest. About thirty yards away, watching\nhim from their mounts, was a small procession. His sister sat at the front—\nstraight-backed and proper in her saddle, face expressionless. A number of\nbodyguards and servants were arrayed around her, most of them looking far\nmore impressed than their master.\nOnce she knew she’d been spotted, Lindet flipped the reins and\napproached. Styke wiped his face with his shirt.\n“After all you’ve been through,” Lindet said as she approached, “you’re\nstill an ox. I can’t believe it.”\nStyke stretched his hand and ignored a twinge in his side. “You expect\nme to fall to sloth in my retirement?”\n“I didn’t expect you to retire,” she snorted.

At a gesture, her companions\ncame to a stop, while Lindet herself brought her horse right up next to Styke\nand dismounted. She draped the reins over a nearby branch. “Let me get\nsomething straight: This new Dynize empress pries the entire Hammer out\nof my hands as a concession for removing her armies peaceably from\nFatrasta, and then turns around and gives it to you? What the pit did you do\nin Dynize to earn that kind of gratitude?”\n“It’s just a bit of land.”\n“It’s thousands of square miles of land, largely unpopulated, with several\nabandoned frontier forts and a proper fortress on the coast. And I’m to\nunderstand you own it all, now?” Lindet’s tone seemed to waver between\nimpressed and annoyed.\nStyke scratched the back of his head, stifling a smile. “I’ve given a lot of\nit to my old Lancers, and I let the towns keep their land, but yeah. I own the\nHammer.”\n“What are you going to do with it?”\n“Damned if I know. I’ve never actually owned land before. For now, I’m\ngoing to build a cabin, then get working on a stable. I figure in a few years I\ncan have a proper horse farm up and running. I’ve also been promised three\nhundred Dynize horses. I’m gonna start breeding them with some of ours\nand see what comes out the other side.”\nLindet sighed. “You. A horse farmer. There’s been a lot of madness in\nmy life the last couple of years, but this might be the most insane.” She\nwaved away a fly, but managed to turn it into a dismissive gesture. “Fine.\nShow me the grave.”\nStyke glanced at Lindet’s retinue. They were still mounted, and keeping\ntheir distance. He let his grin drop and jerked his head. “This way.” He led\nLindet away from his new clearing and about fifty yards through the woods,\nthen across a river and past an arrow-shaped boulder. At the base of a big\nbeech tree sat a rectangle of white marble, marked with the name\n“Marguerie je Lind.” Styke had only done basic maintenance on the small\nmemorial since that night crossing the Hammer last year. It was a shaded,\npleasant spot, but he half expected Lindet to demand why he hadn’t erected\nsomething more grand.\nInstead, his sister pursed her lips and gazed down at the marble marker,\nhands clasped, regarding it in silence for several minutes. “I always\nwondered where you buried her.”\n“I thought you didn’t want to know,” Styke replied. Out of the corner of\nhis eye he spotted Celine hanging around, close enough to eavesdrop but far\nenough to remain respectful.\n“I didn’t,” Lindet replied. “At least, I thought I didn’t. I believed her\nweak for being unable to protect herself from him. But I’ve reassessed those\nbeliefs.”\nStyke was tempted to reignite an argument long forgotten. He bit his\ntongue. “That’s good.”"

He bit his\ntongue. “That’s good.”\nA smile touched the corners of Lindet’s mouth, as if she knew what he\nwas thinking. “I’m on a tour of the country,” she suddenly said, looking up\nto meet his eye.\n“Oh?”\n“It’s been almost a year since the war ended. Relations with the Nine are\nnormalizing. The Dynize empress, beyond the initial concessions she wrung\nout of me, has been nothing but warm. The Palo are icy but coming around.\nIt’s time to rebuild in earnest, and I need to know every corner of the\ncountry that requires help so that I can distribute it.”\n“I see.” Styke eyeballed his sister. There was something different about\nher—a very faint hesitation that had never been there before. “I was in\nBellport a few weeks ago. The newspapers are claiming that you’re going to\nremain Lady Chancellor for six more years and then hold a general election.\nIs that true?”\n“It is.”\n“I wouldn’t have pegged you for giving up power.”\n“I wouldn’t have pegged you for becoming a horse farmer,” she shot\nback.\n“That’s fair.” Styke looked around until he found one of his spare lances\nthat he’d left against a nearby tree. He leaned on it, still watching his sister.\n“Will the election be real?”\nLindet seemed to consider this question for several moments. Speaking\nin a quiet voice, she said, “I’ve spent the last ten years preparing for a\nDynize invasion that I was certain would come sooner rather than later. It\narrived as I suspected, and yet even with all my sacrifices and preparations\nand control, I still wasn’t ready. It… it taught me a valuable lesson.\n“Next week I’m announcing the dissolution of the Blackhats. No more\nsecret police. No more systematic oppression. It didn’t work before and\nnow that I see that, well…” She shrugged. “I can either spend the rest of my\nlife trying to hold on to power for fear of what will happen when I lose it, or\nI can put into place a system in which I can retire in peace without everyone\non the continent hating me. So, yes. The elections will be real.”\n“Will you run in them?”\n“It depends on whether I’ve managed to get everyone to forget how\nmuch they hate me by then.”\n“That’s awfully ambitious for six years,” Styke said glibly.\n“Have you ever known me not to be ambitious?”\n“Point taken.” Styke tapped his ring against his lance. “Will you stay a\ncouple days? We haven’t spoken at length in… quite some time.”\n“No, we haven’t.”\n“I’ve got a proper house in a nearby town, until I’ve finished building\nmy new one here.”\nFor the first time since she was a little girl, Styke saw his sister smile—a\nreal smile, without cruelty or hidden intention. “I’d like that, thank you.”\nShe reached into her pocket and pulled out an envelope. “I heard you\nlegally adopted the girl?”\nStyke gave those papers a wary glance. “I did.”\n“Good.

I know you’re a fan of learning in the saddle, but my niece will\nbe educated. We can discuss those options over dinner tonight.” Glancing\nonce more down at their mother’s grave, Lindet turned to walk back toward\nher waiting retinue.\nCeline waited until she’d gone before joining Styke at the graveside. He\nlooked down at her and snorted. “Lindet wants to send you to school.”\n“I heard,” she replied thoughtfully. “I’m not sure that I’ll like school.”\n“It would be good for you.”\n“Did you go to school?”\n“I did. Boarding, then university, then the continental military academy.\nHated every minute of it, but I did learn a few things. Would you rather go\noff to school now, or help me get the horse farm set up first?”\nCeline’s forehead creased. She stared at nothing in deep thought, then\nlooked up at him. “Why didn’t you tell Auntie Lindet about your deal with\nKa-poel?”\n“Telling her to her face that a foreign empress has made me her prison\nwarden won’t go over well. She might be learning, but Lindet is still a\nproud woman. Either she’ll get thirsty for power again and find out that I’m\nhere to check her power, or it’ll never come up. I’m hoping it’s the latter.”\nCeline nodded along with the explanation. “When will Lindet want me\nto go to school?”\n“Immediately, I’m guessing.”\n“And when will Ibana be back from Dynize?”\n“She’s going to oversee the new imperial guard for another year, then\njoin us. She wants to rebuild her father’s smithy over there.” Styke pointed\noff into the woods.\nCeline considered for several more moments. “I’d like to be here to\nwatch your new town grow. I can go to school when I’m older, right?”\n“Absolutely.” Styke took his lance and walked over to his mother’s\ngrave. He leaned on the shaft, sinking it butt-down into the soft earth until\nthe point was at chest level. Removing his big Lancer ring, he placed it on\nthe tip of the lance and stepped back to view his handiwork. Nodding to\nhimself, he offered his hand to Celine. “Agreed. Now, let’s go pretend to be\ninterested in Lindet’s schools.”\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThank you to my wonderful editor, Brit Hvide, for helping me finish out\nthis series with a bang.
