He could hear gulls\ncalling above and feel the gentle rocking of the ship as it sat in harbor. Both\nsensations had become ubiquitous to him these last few months.\n“Go on,” a voice said.\nOrz looked over his shoulder at the morion-helmed soldier standing just\nbehind him. The soldier held a short pike, a ceremonial weapon carried by\nsome of the bone-eye bodyguards. Orz wondered where they were—what\nport had the floating prison sailed into this time. More importantly, he\nwondered which bone-eye had come to gawk at him now.\nBone-eyes were not unlike Privileged; their vast power was contained\nwithin fragile human bodies that could be broken as easily as any ceramic\nvase. Bone-eyes could die. This bodyguard could die. Orz envisioned\nhimself stalking through the ship, murdering everyone in his path before\nswimming to shore and disappearing into the countryside.\n“We don’t have all day,” the soldier behind him said, thrusting the blade\nof the pike against the small of Orz’s back. “Move.”\nOrz snorted and took the first heavy step, careful lest the weight of his\nchains cause him to lose his balance and tumble backward onto the soldier’s\nblade. He jangled as he climbed, feeling the iron shackles scrape against his\nbare skin, and within a few moments he stepped out into the light of day for\nthe first time in months.\nHe blinked, trying to let his eyes adjust, but was shoved along in front of\nthe soldier. Several other guards arrived, forming a cordon around him,\npushing and prodding him along the deck, half-blind, and then up another\nflight of stairs to the ship’s forecastle.\nOrz felt a hand on his shoulder and jerked away, turning toward the\nrailing and gazing through the pain of the light at an unfamiliar shore. A city\nrose above him, high on an immense plateau covered in strange buildings.\nHe felt his breath catch in his throat; during the long, secluded journey he\nhad thought they were taking him to a new prison somewhere in Dynize.\nThis was not Dynize. This city, this plateau—he knew only one like it in\nthe storybooks: Landfall.\nHe was not given further opportunity to wonder. Hands grasped him by\nthe chains and pulled him forward, driving him to the other edge of the\nforecastle, where he was kicked to his knees. He fell without a sound,\nignoring the pain as he had been taught, and instead raised his eyes to find\nthe bone-eye he’d already guessed had called for him.\nOrz had never met the old man sitting straight-backed on a stool, sipping\nfrom a tiny porcelain cup, but he knew him by description and reputation.\nKa-Sedial was the emperor’s second cousin and chief adviser, and most"

        "text": "from a tiny porcelain cup, but he knew him by description and reputation.\nKa-Sedial was the emperor’s second cousin and chief adviser, and most\npeople in Dynize knew him as the true power behind the crown. He was a\nbone-eye who had risen to power on a tide of blood and taken credit for\nending the Dynize civil war.\nOrz was not impressed. As a dragonman, he was not impressed by much.\nKa-Sedial finished his tea and handed the cup to an attendant, then\nplaced his hands palms-down on his knees and stared out to sea. Orz began\nto think that he was being purposefully ignored when he heard a commotion\nbehind him: another person, wrapped in chains similarly to Orz, was\ndragged up to the forecastle and thrown to her knees.\nThen another was brought up, and then another, until six men and\nwomen knelt before Ka-Sedial. Orz examined his companions. He only\nrecognized two of them, but all five were covered in inky black tattoos,\ntheir bodies hard as granite. They were like him.\nSix dragonmen, all in one place.\n“This is an auspicious gathering,” Orz said softly.\nKa-Sedial finally turned his head, sweeping his gaze across all the\nprisoners. When he spoke, his voice was gentle, forcing Orz to strain to hear\nhim over the creaking of the ship and the squawking of the gulls. “Do you\nknow what you all have in common?”\nThey were all dragonmen, but Orz suspected that was not the answer\nKa-Sedial sought. Orz looked one way, then the other, at his five\ncompanions. The woman to his left had long, dirty red hair that covered\nmost of her face, but he remembered the scar across her left eye. Her name\nwas Ji-Karnari, and seven years ago she desecrated a bone-eye temple for\nreasons he never learned. The man to his right, willowy and small of\nstature, was named Ji-Matle. Nine years ago he was assigned to guard one\nof the emperor’s cousins, whom he bedded.\nNo one spoke up, so Orz cleared his throat. “We have all disgraced\nourselves in the eyes of the emperor.”\n“Very good.” Ka-Sedial stood up, and Orz couldn’t help but smile at\nhow old and frail he looked. He could snap Ka-Sedial like a twig, if not for\nthese chains. Ka-Sedial noticed the smile and his brow wrinkled. He took a\nstep over to Orz. “Tell me, Ji-Orz, what was your crime?”\nOrz closed his eyes, thinking of the last few years spent in this dungeon\nor that, every movement restricted, always watched, like a prize dog gone\nrabid whose masters could not bear to put him down. “I did not bow during\nan audience with the emperor.”\n“And why did you not bow?”\n“Because he is not my emperor.”\nKa-Sedial gave an almost grandfatherly sigh and gestured toward the\nshoreline and the city on the plateau. “The civil war is over. Your false\nemperor is dead and the governments of both sides have reconciled. We\nhave turned our wars outward—as is proper—and we have come to Fatrasta\nto reclaim land that was once ours. We have come to find our god, and we"

        "text": "have turned our wars outward—as is proper—and we have come to Fatrasta\nto reclaim land that was once ours. We have come to find our god, and we\nhave done so together. United.” He sighed once more, shaking his head like\na disappointed teacher, and Orz found himself annoyed that after all he and\nhis companions had suffered, Ka-Sedial would treat them all like children.\n“Why are we here?” Orz asked.\nKa-Sedial looked down at him, a hint of disgust in his eyes, then raised\nhis hands toward the chained dragonmen. “You have all disgraced\nyourselves in the eyes of the emperor, and your positions as dragonmen\nprevent us from spilling your blood. Every one of you will live long lives\nalone in the darkness, left to rot away.”\n“Or?” Orz asked. He could smell it now—the scent of an option, a way\nout. He tried to think of what he knew about Ka-Sedial. The Ka was a\ndriven man, cold and thoughtful but given, from time to time, to rage. He’d\nbuilt his power by destroying or subjugating all that opposed him. He was a\nman who did not take no for an answer, and did not leave any enemy\nstanding.\nAnnoyance flashed briefly across Ka-Sedial’s face at Orz’s interruption.\nHe lowered his hands. “Or you can redeem yourselves. My armies have\ntaken Landfall. We will take Fatrasta in due time. Meanwhile, I have an\nerrand that needs to be run and I cannot spare any of the dragonmen,\nPrivileged, or bone-eyes in my army.”\nThe invasion of Fatrasta had been planned for almost a decade, but Orz\nstill found himself surprised that it had actually happened—that the treaty\nbetween the two sides of the civil war had managed to hold long enough for\nthis to happen. He needed more information about the invasion—what kind\nof people had been found in Fatrasta, their weapons and their warriors. But\nthat would come later, he was sure of it.\nJi-Karnari, the scarred woman beside Orz, finally raised her head. Orz\ncould see the eagerness in her eyes and couldn’t help but judge her.\nDragonmen should hide their emotions better.\n“What is this errand, Great Ka?” Ji-Karnari asked. “How can we be\nredeemed?”\nKa-Sedial put his hand out, brushing his fingertips along Ji-Karnari’s\nforehead. She shuddered at the sensation. He said, “There were …\nhumiliations suffered in the taking of Landfall. Humiliations against the\narmy, and humiliations against the dragonmen. I have already sent soldiers\nto deal with the former, but the latter …” He trailed off, smiling coldly.\n“One of your order—one of the very best dragonmen by the name of Ji-\nKushel—was murdered in Landfall by a common soldier.”\n“So?” Orz asked. He felt emboldened. This was a way out now, and Ka-\nSedial was going to give it to him. But he did not trust Ka-Sedial, and he\nwould ask questions. “Many common soldiers have killed dragonmen.\nThere are overwhelming numbers or lucky shots, or—”\n“In single combat,” Ka-Sedial cut him off."

        "text": "would ask questions. “Many common soldiers have killed dragonmen.\nThere are overwhelming numbers or lucky shots, or—”\n“In single combat,” Ka-Sedial cut him off.\nOrz heard his teeth click together as he quickly shut his mouth. The hair\non the back of his neck stood on end. He’d heard rumors of powder mages,\nsorcerers who might have the speed and strength to kill a dragonman with\nthe aid of their magic. But Ka-Sedial would have said so if it was one of\nthose. For a common soldier to kill a dragonman in single combat? That\nwas a humiliation.\nKa-Sedial looked toward the land again, one hand twitching as if in\nimpatience. “I do not stand for such humiliation. This soldier is an old\nwarrior and, if given time, may attract followers. He may become even\nmore dangerous than he already is. I am cutting you loose. All six of you. I\nwant you to work together, with Ji-Karnari in command.”\nA smile crossed Ji-Karnari’s face. Orz resisted the urge to roll his eyes.\nA small part of him wanted to spit on Ka-Sedial’s feet and tell him off, but a\nmuch larger part had no interest in spending the rest of his life in chains. He\nwould accomplish Ka-Sedial’s task, and then he would revel in his freedom.\n“Who is this soldier?” Orz asked.\n“He is a lancer by the name of Ben Styke,” Ka-Sedial replied. “Find him\nand bring me his head.”\nCHAPTER 1\nA\ns a child, General Vlora Flint had heard stories of refugee camps formed\nduring the Gurlish Wars. Whole cities displaced, a million people on the run\nfrom enemy armies, or even forced from their homes by their own soldiers.\nThe camps, she’d been told, were places of untold suffering and misery.\nDisease and starvation were rampant, bodies left unburied, and the people\nliving in constant fear of the next army to come upon them.\nVlora, in all her nightmares, had never imagined herself de facto leader\nof such a camp.\nShe stood on a gentle rise overlooking the Hadshaw River Valley and\nsurveyed the long, winding string of wagons, tents, and cookfires that\nstretched into the distance. It was early morning, the air heavy and humid,\nand all she could think about was the numbers that her quartermasters had\nbrought her just an hour ago. They’d finished their counts and estimated\nthat over three hundred thousand people had fled Landfall—just over a third\nof the city—and that of those, some two hundred and twenty thousand were\nfollowing this river valley toward Redstone.\nHer own men, including the Mad Lancers and the Landfall garrison, had\nbeen badly mauled during the defense of the city. She had less than ten\nthousand men under her command, just one soldier for every twenty-two\npeople.\nHow in Adom’s name was she going to organize this mess, let alone\nprotect it?\nShe pulled herself out of her own head and looked at the camp below\nher.

Three weeks since\nthe Battle of Landfall and disease was already beginning to spread; many of\nher own soldiers had contracted dysentery. Food and medicine were in short\nsupply. Most people had left the city in a panic, grabbing valuables rather\nthan necessities, and fled without plan or destination.\nShe inclined her head slightly toward the man waiting patiently beside\nher. Olem was of middle height, a few inches taller than her, with sandy hair\nand a graying beard. He walked with a slight limp, and his right arm was\nstill in a sling from a bullet wound from Landfall. He was a Knacked—\npossessing a singular sorcerous talent that kept him from needing sleep—\nbut even he looked tired as piss, with crow’s-feet in the corners of his eyes\nand his face gaunt with worry. She wanted to order him to rest, but knew\nhe’d ignore her.\nShe wasn’t entirely sure what she’d do without him.\n“Any sign of the Dynize?” she asked, turning from her view of the\nrefugees to look back down the river the way they’d come. Landfall was\nabout sixty miles to their southeast, and the road that direction was dotted\nwith stragglers. Her own army was camped here, guarding the rear of the\nrefugee convoy.\nOlem sucked on a cigarette, smoke curling out of his nostrils, before\ngiving a measured response. “Scouting parties,” he said. “They’re watching\nus leave. But I imagine they’re too busy solidifying their hold on Landfall\nto bother coming after us. For now.”\n“You know,” Vlora said, shooting him a sour look, “you could leave off\nthe ‘for now.’ It just sounds ominous.”\n“I never try to give you anything but the facts,” Olem responded,\nstraight-faced. “And the fact is they’re leaving us alone. I can’t imagine it’ll\nlast forever. I’ve got our dragoons sweeping our rear, trying to catch one of\nthose scouting parties, but they’ve come up with nothing so far.”\nVlora swore inwardly. She needed to know the state of the city. She and\nher men had won the Battle of Landfall, only to be forced to abandon it at\nword of an even bigger Dynize army on the way. Last she knew, that army\nhad begun to land near the city, and she had no intelligence since then. How\nbig was that army? Were they pushing outward aggressively? Were they\ntaking their time to fortify the city? Did they have more Privileged sorcerers\nand bone-eyes?\nBeyond food and supplies for so many people, the next most valuable\ncommodity was information. She needed to know whether the Dynize were\nhot on her heels. She also needed to know if the Fatrastan Army was\nheading this direction, because that offered its own set of complications.\n“Any word from Lindet?”\nOlem pursed his lips. “Nothing official. We’ve taken in nearly two\nthousand Blackhats. None of them seem to have orders, or know of the\nfalling out between you and their Lady Chancellor. I’ve put them to work as\na police force among the refugees.”\nOlem’s ability to keep even the biggest army occupied and organized"

        "text": "falling out between you and their Lady Chancellor. I’ve put them to work as\na police force among the refugees.”\nOlem’s ability to keep even the biggest army occupied and organized\nnever failed to amaze her. “You’re a saint, but keep a close eye on those\nBlackhats. Any of them could be Lindet’s spies. She may have left town\ntwo steps ahead of us, but if she didn’t leave eyes and ears to keep track of\nme, I’ll eat my hat.”\n“And I, mine,” Olem agreed. “But I’ve got my own men among them.\nI’ll keep things sorted as best as I can. Did you know Styke is openly\nrecruiting from the Blackhats to fill out the ranks of his lancers?”\nVlora snorted. “With success?”\n“More than I expected. He’s making them renounce their loyalty to the\nLady Chancellor before they can sign on. The Blackhats are damned angry\nshe abandoned so many of them without orders. He’s got over a hundred\nalready.”\n“And may Adom help any spies he catches,” Vlora said. She hesitated,\nher eyes on a string of horsemen riding single file along the other side of the\nriver. They were a company of hers, wearing their tall dragoon helmets and\ncrimson uniforms with blue trim, straight swords and carbines lashed to the\nsaddles. “Did I make a mistake giving Styke command of my cavalry?”\n“I don’t think so,” Olem replied.\n“You hesitated.”\n“Did I?”\nVlora clasped her hands behind her back to keep from fiddling with her\nlapels. “Lindet told me he’s an uncontrollable monster.”\n“I get the feeling,” Olem responded, dropping his cigarette butt and\ncrushing it beneath the heel of his boot, “that Lindet’s version of the truth is\nwhatever is convenient at the time. Besides, right now he’s our monster.”\n“Again, that’s not reassuring.” Vlora tried to get a rein on her thoughts.\nThey were unfocused, scattered, and the sheer number of uncertainties\nrunning through her head was enough to drive her mad. There was so much\nto attend to within her own army—Blackhat stragglers, the city garrison, the\nMad Lancers, and the core of the brigade of mercenaries she brought with\nher from Adro. She had over five thousand picked men, many of them\nwounded, half a world away from their homes, without an employer. A\ndesperate bark of a laugh escaped her lips, and Olem shot her a worried\nglance.\n“You all right?” he asked in a low voice.\n“I’m fine,” she said reassuringly. “There’s just … a lot to take in.”\n“You know these refugees aren’t your responsibility,” Olem said, not for\nthe first time.\n“Yes, they are.”\n“Why?”\nVlora tried to find a satisfactory answer. She wondered what Field\nMarshal Tamas would have done in such a situation, and realized that he\nwould have marched to the nearest unoccupied city and booked passage\nhome for his troops the moment his contract became null. But she was not\nTamas. Besides, there were more reasons to stay in this land than a quarter\nof a million refugees. “Because,” she finally answered, “no one else will do\nit.”"

Besides, there were more reasons to stay in this land than a quarter\nof a million refugees. “Because,” she finally answered, “no one else will do\nit.”\n“The men are beginning to wonder where their next stack of krana will\ncome from.”\nAnother of a thousand worries. A little bitter part of her wanted to tell\nthe men that they should be more concerned about getting out of Fatrasta\nalive than their next payment, but she couldn’t be too hard on them. They\nwere mercenaries, after all. “Give them promissory notes against my own\nholdings.”\n“I already did.”\n“Without asking me?”\nOlem gave her a small smile and dug in his pocket for a pouch of\ntobacco and some rolling papers. “I figured you’d give the order at some\npoint. But not even you can pay them indefinitely.”\n“I’ll figure out something.” Vlora waved him off as if she wasn’t\nconcerned, but it was a worry that kept her up at night. A thought suddenly\nhit her and she squinted down into the camp. “You know, I haven’t seen\nTaniel or Ka-poel for a while. Where the pit are they?”\n“They remained in the city when we left.”\nVlora scowled. “And you didn’t think to tell me?”\n“I did, actually. Twice. You assured me both times that you’d heard\nevery word I was saying.”\n“I lied.” Vlora felt a sudden stab of despair. Despite their rocky history,\nTaniel was a reassuring man to have around, and not just because he was a\none-man army. “Why would they stay in the city? Are they gathering\nintelligence?”\nOlem shrugged, then hesitated before saying, “I know you and Taniel\nhave known each other a long time. But don’t forget that those two have\ntheir own agenda.”\nIt was not a reminder Vlora needed—or wanted. Taniel was more than\nan old lover; he was an adopted sibling and a childhood friend. Instinct told\nher to trust him, but years of military and political training reminded her\nthat shared history was a long time ago. So much had changed.\nWith everything going on right now, his disappearance was the least of\nher worries. She ran her fingers through her tangled hair, wondering how\nlong it had been since she’d had a proper bath. Setting aside her discomfort,\nshe said, “I need information.”\n“Well, we might have something.” Olem pointed toward a uniformed\nmessenger hurrying his way up the hill toward them.\n“It won’t be useful,” Vlora responded, annoyed. “It’s going to be some\nasshole city commissioner trying to hassle me for supplies he thinks we’re\nhoarding from the refugees. Again.”\n“I bet it’s something important.”\n“I bet it’s not.”\n“I’ll bet you that spare pouch of tobacco you keep in the left cuff of your\njacket,” Olem said.\n“Deal,” Vlora said, watching the messenger approach. It was a young\nwoman with a private’s insignia on her lapel, and she saluted smartly as she\ncame to a stop.\n“Ma’am,” the messenger said, “I’ve got word from Captain Davd.”\nVlora shot Olem a look. “Is it important?”\n“Yes, ma’am. He said he’s spotted a Dynize pursuit force.”"

This would mean a battle. It would mean men dead and the lives of all\nthese refugees at stake. But at least she could finally see her enemy.\nShe dug into her sleeve and pulled out her pouch of emergency tobacco,\nhanding it to Olem without looking at him. Smug bastard. “Take me to\nCaptain Davd.”\nThe Hadshaw River Valley was heavily trafficked, the old-growth forests\nthat had once sprawled across this part of Fatrasta logged into extinction\nover the last couple hundred years. The land was rocky and unforgiving,\nvery unlike the floodplains closer to the city or the plantations to the west.\nFarmsteads dotted the hilly landscape, surrounded by walls built from the\nstones the farmers dug from their fields.\nThe occasional rocky precipice was topped by a stand of scraggly honey\nlocusts, and it was in such a vantage point that she found two of her soldiers\nhunkered on their knees between the boulders.\nCaptain Davd was in his early twenties, with black hair and a soft,\nbeardless face. He tapped powder-stained fingernails against the stock of an\nancient blunderbuss and nodded as Vlora crept up beside him.\nHis companion was an older woman with graying, dirty-blond hair.\nNorrine lay with her head against a stone, her rifle propped on a branch,\nsighting along it as she watched some target only she could see.\nAnyone else might find it odd to discover two captains out on a scouting\nmission, but Vlora took it in stride. Like her, they were both powder mages.\nBy ingesting a bit of black powder, they could run faster, see farther, and\nhear better than any normal soldier. It made them ideal scouts for an army\non the run. She had taken a page out of her mentor’s book and given\npowder mages under her command a middling rank and an auxiliary role.\nThey answered only to her.\nIn addition to scouting, they could also use their sorcery to fire a musket\nor rifle over fantastic distances, picking off the most difficult targets.\n“Norrine has an officer in her sights,” Davd said in an excited whisper.\n“Say the word, and they’ll be down a ranking metalhead.”\nVlora snorted. Her men had begun to refer to Dynize soldiers as\n“metalheads” because of the conical helmets they wore. She laid a hand\ngently on Norrine’s shoulder. “How about you fill me in on what’s going on\nbefore you start killing people.”\nDavd looked crestfallen. Norrine gave Vlora a thumbs-up and kept her\nbead on her target.\n“Well?” Vlora urged Davd.\nDavd shifted to make room for Vlora to hunker down between him and\nNorrine in the rocky crag. She crawled up beside them, looking over the\nedge of their vantage point, and fished a powder charge from her breast\npocket. She cut through the paper with her thumbnail and held it to her right\nnostril, snorting gently."

        "text": "edge of their vantage point, and fished a powder charge from her breast\npocket. She cut through the paper with her thumbnail and held it to her right\nnostril, snorting gently.\nHer senses flared, giving her an immediate high as sounds, colors, and\nsmells all became brighter. The world came into focus, and she squinted\ndown the length of the Hadshaw River Highway toward a small party of\nsoldiers in the distance. The powder trance allowed her to see details as if\nshe were a mere fifty yards away, and she took quick stock of the enemy.\nLong experience at this sort of thing gave her an estimate of five hundred or\nso soldiers, at about two miles distance. They wore the silver breastplates\nand bright blue uniforms of the Dynize soldiery. About half of them rode\nhorses, which was new to Vlora—the Dynize who had attacked Landfall\nhad no calvary.\nThe troop was on the move, the horses trotting while the soldiers\nmarched double time. Every so often they were joined by a rider coming\nover the ridge from the east or fording the river from the west. Messages\nwere exchanged, and then a dispatch was sent south.\n“It’s a vanguard,” Vlora concluded.\n“Making regular reports,” Davd added. “I’m willing to bet they’re no\nmore than a couple of miles ahead of the main army. They’re probing,\nchecking the lay of the land and trying to draw out our rear guard.”\n“They’re moving awfully fast for a vanguard.”\n“Huh,” Davd commented. “So they are.”\nVlora took a shaky breath. Her army—and the refugees they were\nguarding—were less than five miles from the pursuing Dynize. If the army\nwas traveling as fast as the vanguard, they could force a battle before\nnightfall. If they took their time, Vlora might have two days to prepare. She\nwondered whether she should attempt to gain a few more miles before\nnightfall, pushing the refugees ahead of her, or choose a defensive position\nimmediately. “You two, get me information. I want eyes on the enemy\narmy. I want to know their strength and how fast they’re moving. No guns,\nand don’t be seen.”\nShe crawled out of the thicket of honey locusts and returned to the\nmessenger who’d shown her the way. “We have enemy contact. Have\nsomeone prepare my rifles, then go find Major Gustar. He and Colonel\nStyke have an enemy vanguard to crush.”\nCHAPTER 2\nB\nen Styke sat at the crest of a hill, his scarred face turned toward the\nmorning sun, the ground damp and cool beneath him. He leaned against his\nsaddle while his warhorse, Amrec, grazed nearby. The sun warmed Styke’s\nbones, allowed him to test the limits imposed upon him by old wounds.

She continued down the wall a hundred\nyards or so and turned around, doubling her speed for the trip back.\nSomewhere over the nearby hills was Lady Vlora Flint—Styke’s new\ncommanding officer—along with her tiny mercenary army and hundreds of\nthousands of refugees from Landfall. Styke kept his own men away from\nthe column, preferring to flank the refugees and handle the scouting.\nRefugees weren’t his problem. Killing—when it had to be done—was.\nStyke squeezed the pebbles until a bead of sweat trickled down his\nforehead. He searched the back of his mind for his birthday—one of the\nmany things forgotten after so long in the labor camps—and decided he was\njust a few months away from his forty-sixth. Almost old enough to be\nCeline’s grandfather. Certainly old enough to be her real father, if he’d\ngotten a late start.\nCeline reached the end of the wall nearby and leapt to the grass. She\nwasn’t wearing shoes, despite having two new pairs, and her jacket and\nloose trousers were muddy from three weeks on the road. She had a girl’s\nlong hair and a soft face, but her bearing left her mistaken for a boy more\ntimes than not. She was at once skittish and confident, the daughter of a\nthief and toughened by years in the labor camps.\nShe grasped Amrec fearlessly by the bridle, stroking his nose. He\nsnorted at her but did not kick her to oblivion as he would anyone else so\ndaring.\nStyke discarded the pebbles and brushed the grit from his hands. The\nrelease of pressure on his tendons made him swallow a gasp, and he took a\ndeep breath before calling to Celine.\n“How do you decide which stone to step on?” he asked her.\nCeline seemed surprised by the question. She left Amrec and came over\nto Styke’s side, throwing herself down against the saddle in the mock\nexaggeration of a tired soldier. She was, Styke decided, spending too much\ntime with the lancers. Not that that would change any time soon.\n“I just step on whichever one looks secure.”\n“And how do you know which is secure?”\n“I just know,” Celine said with a small shrug.\n“Hmm. Think, girl,” Styke replied. “Think about how you know.”\nCeline opened her mouth, closed it again, and furrowed her brow. “I\ndon’t step on the flat ones. They’re the worst, because they wobble. The\nones that are shaped like …” She made a triangle with her hands.\n“Like a wedge?” Styke urged.\nHer face brightened. “Yeah, like a wedge. Those are the strongest,\nbecause they rest on two other stones.”\n“Very good.” Styke searched in his saddlebag and found a bag of\nwrapped caramels that he’d discovered while looting a Blackhat supply\ndepot before leaving Landfall. He placed one in Celine’s hand.\nCeline regarded the sweet seriously before looking up at Styke. “Why\ndoes it matter? Didn’t you tell me that instinct is a lancer’s best weapon?"

        "text": "Celine regarded the sweet seriously before looking up at Styke. “Why\ndoes it matter? Didn’t you tell me that instinct is a lancer’s best weapon?\nThat’s what I use to find the stones, isn’t it?”\nStyke considered his answer and glanced down the hill. Far below them,\nseveral hundred lancers practiced drills on horseback, riding back and forth\nacross the small valley until it was a muddy cesspit. He listened to the\nshouts of his officers as they barked corrections and orders. “Instinct is just\na word we use to describe all the little bits of information your senses\ncollect and how your brain interprets them. Instincts can be improved.”\n“So, when you make me inter … inter …”\n“Interpret.”\n“Interpret my instincts, you’re exercising my brain? Like what you’re\ndoing with your wrists?”\nStyke grunted, stifling a smirk. “You’re a clever little shit, you know\nthat?”\n“Ibana says that’s why you like me,” Celine responded, sticking her chin\nin the air.\n“Ibana says a lot of things. Most of them are bullshit.” Styke climbed to\nhis feet, leaning down to tousle Celine’s hair, then turning a critical eye on\nthe lancers training down below. The training lasted hours each day as\nIbana whipped old lancers and new recruits alike into shape. Both men and\nhorses had to be trained, and Styke didn’t know of any army on this\ncontinent that drilled as hard as the Mad Lancers.\nBut that’s part of what made them the best.\nStyke felt an ache deep in his back, in his thighs, and in his shoulders.\nHe took a few breaths and stretched. There was a time when he was just shy\nof seven feet tall, and not a man in Fatrasta would have looked him in the\neye. He was the biggest, strongest, and meanest—a hero of the Fatrastan\nrevolution with a lover in every town between the coasts.\nNow he was a broken man, and though mended by sorcery he was still\nbent from years in the labor camps, gnarled from wounds left by the firing\nsquad.\n“I’m still Ben Styke,” he whispered to himself. He thought about going\ndown there, participating in the drills. He was out of practice himself, and\nhe’d had Amrec for less than a month. Any warhorse big enough to carry\nStyke would need plenty of time learning the maneuvers of a lancer\nbattalion. But that could wait. Half the lancers were old comrades, gathered\nfrom Landfall before it ended up in the hands of the Dynize. The other half\nwere raw recruits. Best to remain aloof and let Ibana train them on the\nlegend of Mad Ben Styke, rather than see the broken soul he’d become.\nHe turned to find Celine staring at the side of his face—at the scar where\na bullet had bounced off his cheekbone a decade ago. Celine had grown\nbold since leaving the labor camps at his side. She was bigger, stronger,\nresponding well to a healthy diet. In ten years she would be a stout woman\nwith fists of iron, and Styke pitied the men who might think her an easy tail\nto chase.\n“Ibana says not to let you feel sorry for yourself.”"

She says self-pity makes you a dog, and\nshe needs you to be a man.”\nWhat the pit was Ibana doing telling all this to a little girl? Styke’s little\ngirl, particularly. “Ibana needs to shut her bloody mouth.”\nCeline stretched out against Amrec’s saddle and stared up at the sky.\n“The boys have been telling me stories about you during the war.”\n“Shit.” Styke sighed. As much as he tried to avoid it, Celine had become\nsomething of a favorite in the camp. Everyone who’d lost a daughter or a\ncousin or a sister back during the war took it upon themselves to tell her\nstories and “raise her up right.” Aloof or not, Styke was going to have to\nstart cracking heads.\n“Did you really kill a Warden with your bare hands?”\nStyke snorted. “I told you that story.”\n“Yeah, but I didn’t believe it before. I thought you were making stuff up.\nMy da used to make stuff up all the time so his friends thought he was\ntough. But Jackal said you did kill a Warden. Did you?”\n“I did. Broke his back, then cut his throat.”\nCeline nodded seriously, as if this were the response she expected.\n“Then Ibana’s right. You shouldn’t pity yourself. You’re too strong to pity\nyourself.”\n“Okay,” Styke said, pushing her off his saddle with one toe. “That’s it.\nI’m not letting you spend time with Ibana anymore. Or Jackal. Or Sunin. I\ndon’t need everyone thinking they can heal me. I’m fine.” His final\ninsistence rang a little too forceful, even to his ears. “That was over ten\nyears ago. You weren’t even a twinkle in your daddy’s eye back then. I’m\nnot strong enough to kill a Warden anymore. People change. That’s the\nnature of life.”\n“You killed a dragonman. I saw the body after.”\nStyke looked down at his hands. If he focused hard enough, he could\nstill feel the slick, warm blood up to his elbows, the bits of brain between\nhis knuckles. “Yeah,” he said uncertainly. The memory felt like a dream. “I\ndid, didn’t I?” He shook his head. “All right, enough of this. Help me get\nAmrec’s saddle on him. He and I need to go through some paces before\nIbana lets everyone go for the day.”\nStyke was tightening the straps on the saddle while Celine fed Amrec an\napple, when he heard the sound of approaching hooves. He looked up to\nfind Major Gustar, commander of Lady Flint’s cuirassier and dragoon\ncompanies. Gustar rode with the comfortable slouch of a natural horseman,\nand he gave Amrec an appreciative glance as he reined in. “Afternoon,\nColonel.”"

        "text": "companies. Gustar rode with the comfortable slouch of a natural horseman,\nand he gave Amrec an appreciative glance as he reined in. “Afternoon,\nColonel.”\nGustar was a tall man, thin and bowlegged with the shoulders of a saber-\nswinging cuirassier. He had brown hair, perfectly trimmed muttonchops,\nand a clean-shaven face. He struck Styke as the type of man who’d joined\nthe cavalry to impress women and was surprised to find he was a capable\nofficer.\n“Gustar. Word from Lady Flint?”\n“Indeed. We’ve spotted a Dynize vanguard.”\n“How large?”\n“Five hundred. Mixed horse and infantry.”\n“Any idea what kind of an army is coming up behind them?”\n“We do. Five brigades of infantry, and they’re marching recklessly fast.\nFlint expects to engage them this evening.”\nStyke played with his big lancers’ ring, looking down toward the drilling\nlancers. The words to an old lancers’ hymn came to him, and he sang under\nhis breath, “Ride, lancers, ride, through the meadows, against the tide. Let\nyour hooves ring, steel ring; break your lances, break their bones, break\ntheir spirit against the stones.” He took a deep breath. “What are our\norders?”\n“You have command of me and my cavalry again. Lady Flint is\npreparing a welcome for the Dynize. We’re to crush their vanguard and then\nsweep their eastern flank to keep their scouts from seeing her preparations.”\n“Cavalry?”\n“Not that we’ve seen. We suspect that their horses are simply what they\ncould scrounge from Landfall.”\nStyke smirked. “We took all the good ones when we left. They’ll have\nnothing but fourth-rate mounts. You said they’ll be here this evening?”\n“That’s what we expect.”\nStyke looked up. It was still early in the morning, but he could tell it\nwould be a pleasant day. It was hot, but not too hot, and the humidity was\nbearable. As good a day as any for killing. “Ride, lancers, ride,” he sang to\nhimself. Louder, to Gustar, he said, “Pass on the orders to Ibana. We head\nout within the hour.”\nStyke and Celine watched the arrival of the Riflejack cavalry—a force of\nover a thousand that included a few hundred cuirassiers in their steel\nbreastplates and bearskin hats, along with a larger contingent of dragoons,\nall riding under the Riflejacks’ flag of a shako over crossed rifles. Styke\nwaited until they had streamed into the Mad Lancers’ camp and then rode\ndown to join them.\nHe found his second-in-command, Ibana ja Fles, standing next to a\nmakeshift headquarters—a tent flying the skull and lance of the Mad\nLancers—issuing orders and reviewing inventory reports. Major Gustar\nstood nearby, his jacket resting loosely over his shoulders, hand on the butt\nof his saber, eyeing his men in silence. Styke lowered Celine from the\nsaddle and followed her down, tying Amrec to a post before heading over to\njoin the officers.\nIbana finished with a set of reports and handed them off to a soldier."

All I know is we need to keep them from getting a good look\nat her formations.”\n“Do they have cavalry beyond those in the vanguard?”\nGustar spread his hands. “Sorry.”\n“Pit. We need better information than this.”\nIbana snorted. “Yeah, well. This whole venture was your idea. So what\ndo we do?”\n“How are the new recruits?” Styke responded with his own question.\n“They’ll do.” Ibana sucked on her teeth. “I’d like another three months\nto train them, but that’s not going to happen.”\nGustar gestured toward her. “Same here. We’ve been trying to fill out\nour numbers from Adran ex-pats and retired cavalry officers among the\nrefugees. They’re a willing bunch, but very rusty.”\nLike Ibana said, they would have to do. Almost a third of their number\nwould be green or out-of-practice riders with just a few weeks of training\nunder their belts. “Make a buddy system,” he said.\n“A what?” Ibana replied.\n“A buddy system.” Styke smiled grimly. “They used to do that in the\nlabor camps when a new batch of prisoners came in. Pair one of the new\nguys with two or three old hands. The old convicts were responsible for the\nnew—teach them the ropes, the guard signals, the schedule.”\n“And that worked?” Ibana asked doubtfully.\n“Seemed to. I knew the camp quartermaster, and she said the buddy\nsystem extended life expectancy and reduced injuries.” He tapped his finger\non the side of his leg thoughtfully, fiddling with his big lancers’ ring. “Of\ncourse, every once in a while the old convicts would just murder the new\none for his shoes.”\n“That,” Major Gustar said, “is not reassuring.”\nStyke ignored him. “We do as we’re told. Smash the vanguard and then\ngo looking for trouble.” He pictured a mental map of the area, considering\nthe refugees, the river, and Flint’s forces. “The river is too deep for them to\nflank us, but they may send scouts. Gustar, I want you to take a hundred and\nfifty of your dragoons and sweep the west bank. Keep eyes off of Flint.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nStyke flexed his fingers, feeling that twinge in his wrist. He wasn’t the\nyoung, strapping cavalry officer he’d once been. But he was the best Flint\nwas going to get. “Ibana, take the rest of the Riflejacks down the road. I’ll\nswing wide with the lancers and we’ll hit that vanguard before they know\nwhat’s happening.”"

        "text": "was going to get. “Ibana, take the rest of the Riflejacks down the road. I’ll\nswing wide with the lancers and we’ll hit that vanguard before they know\nwhat’s happening.”\nStyke walked among the dead on the banks of the Hadshaw after a short,\nbloody battle. The Dynize vanguard had tried to withdraw when they saw\nthe Riflejacks bearing down, and had run straight into the lancers. Some\nfled, some fought, but he’d caught them all in his pincer movement and\nthey’d been ground into dust in an appalling slaughter.\nHe searched through the corpses until he found his lance, buried through\nthe chest of a Dynize scout. The scout was a middle-aged woman, and her\neyes shot open when Styke grasped the handle of his lance. She made a\ndeep sucking sound, her mouth bubbling blood. She tried to reach toward\nhim. He drew his boz knife and ended her suffering with a single stroke\nbefore reclaiming his lance, leaving the body where it lay.\nHe wiped the gore off the tip and examined the corpses of the vanguard.\nThe horsemen wore turquoise uniforms and carried a light kit with nothing\nmore than a knife and an outdated carbine for defense. The infantry still\ncarried the same short bayonets that they’d used in the assault on Landfall\nand had been unprepared for a flanking maneuver by cavalry. Styke was\nunsurprised to see only a few bodies belonging to Riflejack dragoons, and\nnone to his lancers.\nIbana approached on horseback, her roan picking its way through the\nbodies with an almost dainty affection. “We got them all,” she reported.\n“It’ll take the main Dynize army a few hours to figure out something is\nwrong. I’ve got boys set up all along the road to ambush any messengers\nwho come looking for the vanguard.”\nStyke lifted his eyes from his lance and looked across the river, where\nGustar and his dragoons hugged the shoreline and cleaned up the handful of\nDynize who’d braved the depths of the river to flee. He tapped his ring\nagainst the lance, frowning. “Why do I feel uneasy?”\n“Too clean of a kill?” Ibana suggested. “They barely put up a fight.”\nStyke grunted an answer and put his lance over his shoulder and headed\nback to where Amrec stood nibbling at the grass on the riverbank. He patted\nAmrec’s nose, speaking over his shoulder. “Gather the horses. Send any\nprisoners back to Flint. She’ll want to interrogate them. I think that …” He\ntrailed off, turning around to examine the field of slaughter.\nThe dead lay scattered in a radius of about ninety yards. Riderless horses\nhad already been captured by attentive lancers, though some had fled in the\nconfusion.\nIbana seemed to sense something was amiss. “What is it?”\nStyke climbed into Amrec’s saddle and searched among his own men\nuntil he found Sunintiel—an ancient woman who looked like she’d be\nunhorsed by a breeze. Celine sat behind Sunin in the saddle, and waved\nwhen Styke gestured her over to a captured Dynize horse.\n“Tell me what’s wrong with this horse,” Styke said when the two"

Sunin opened her mouth, but Styke made a shushing motion.\n“Celine.”\nThe girl’s forehead wrinkled. “Nothing is wrong with it,” she said.\n“Its health is fine, sure,” Styke said. “But what about it is out of place?”\nBy this time several of his officers had arrived. Looks of understanding\nbegan to dawn on their faces. They remained silent. Celine glanced around\nnervously. Styke watched her trying to work out the solution. “Don’t worry\nabout them. Worry about that horse. What can you tell me about it?”\n“Small,” she said. “Probably pretty quick. Not particularly strong. It was\nspooked by the battle. By the hindquarters I’d say it was bred for endurance\nover other qualities.”\nProud smirks spread among the officers, and Styke had no doubt each of\nthem would take credit for teaching Celine about horses. But he knew\nwhere she really learned it, and stifled his own smile. “What kind is it?”\n“It might …” She hesitated. “It might be a Unice desert racer. But I\nhaven’t seen a horse with those markings before.”\n“Neither have I,” Styke said. “Neither has any of us.” He swung down\nfrom Amrec and gave the captured horse a quick walk-around, treating it to\na whisper and a light touch to calm its nerves. He returned to Amrec and\npulled himself into the saddle. “I’ll bet my saddle this is a Dynisian.”\nMutters followed the proclamation.\n“I’ve never heard of that,” Celine said.\n“That’s because the Dynize have been a closed nation for over a hundred\nyears, and before that they weren’t exactly friendly.” Styke searched his\nmemory. “Supposedly, Dynisians were bred for, as you said, endurance.\nThey’re an all-purpose horse, meant to be docile, obedient, generic, and\neasily interchangeable. Just about every Fatrastan breed has a bit of\nDynisian in them, going back to when the Dynize actually ruled this\ndamned place.”\n“So, what’s so special about this one?” Celine asked.\n“Nothing more than any of the others,” Styke said, gesturing toward a\ngroup of lancers attempting to run down riderless horses up on the ridge.\nIbana snorted. “We don’t have time for this, Ben. Tell the girl what\nyou’re getting at.”\n“Right, right,” Styke said. He stretched his fingers and adjusted his lance\nbefore climbing back into Amrec’s saddle. “A Dynisian here means that the\nDynize have cavalry—they’re not just using scrounged fourth-rate Fatrastan\nhorses.” He meditated on the possibilities for a moment. “We’re not just\nsweeping for scouts now. We’re looking for an enemy cavalry force, and we\nhave no idea how big it will be.” He looked around at his officers. “Strip the\nbodies of anything useful.”\nThey were on the move again within fifteen minutes.

        "text": "They were on the move again within fifteen minutes. Captured horses\ntrailed behind their column, and Styke made sure that his “buddy system”\nwas still in place. They’d had more injuries during that quick battle from\ngreen riders getting fingers tangled in the reins than they had from actual\nenemy combatants, and he needed to keep those kinds of accidents to a\nminimum.\nThey headed east away from the river, then cut south to flank it, being\nsure to keep at least two hills between themselves and the river valley at all\ntimes. His own scouting parties fanned out to watch for contact with the\nenemy army.\nStyke couldn’t help but shake a feeling of uneasiness. He shouldn’t be\nsurprised by Dynize cavalry, not really. Lancers would make quick work of\nany force riding Dynisian mounts. So what was bothering him? The\nprospect of greater numbers? Disappointment that he had more to worry\nabout than flanking enemy infantry?\nHe was still pondering this question almost an hour later when Ibana\njoined him at a gallop.\n“We have contact!” she shouted.\nStyke snapped out of his reverie. “Where? To the west? From the river?”\n“No, south. Directly south!” Ibana was flushed, and she immediately\nbegan barking orders.\nStyke was about to ask for an explanation when he topped a small rise in\nthe landscape and inhaled sharply. Directly in front of them, riding in their\ndirection, was a wide column of Dynize cavalry. Breastplates shone in the\nevening sun, and at half a mile he could see that they were armed with\nsabers and pistols. Their column was spread out, moving at a walk with no\nreal cohesion, and he could see a sudden flurry of excitement ripple through\nthem.\nIbana raised her looking glass to her eye for a moment, then stowed it in\nher packs with a curse. “They’re as surprised as we are. God damn it, we\nmust have taken out each other’s scouts.”\nIt didn’t take a genius to realize why they were here. The Dynize cavalry\nwere going to attempt the same thing as the lancers—flank the enemy. But\ninstead of a handful of ill-equipped riders on fourth-rate horses, these were\nDynize cuirassiers, and there appeared to be almost two thousand of them.\n“Orders, sir?” Ibana asked. “We’re outnumbered and have no element of\nsurprise. All things being equal, they’ve got us.”\nStyke rocked back and forth in his stirrups. Beneath him, Amrec began\nto stomp, pawing at the ground in anticipation. Styke had to think quickly.\nThey could outrun the weaker Dynisian horses. But a retreat would only\ngive the Dynize extra ground and the time to assess Styke’s forces. Best-\ncase scenario: Draw them all the way back to the Riflejack infantry and set\nup some sort of ambush. But Flint could not afford the men to deal with\nDynize cavalry. He needed to handle this on his own.\n“Orders!” Ibana snapped.\n“Send a runner to Flint. Tell her we’ve met a superior force.”\n“And?”\n“And we have engaged. Split the column. Arrow formation. Lancers will\ntip, Riflejack cuirassiers just behind. Send our dragoons in two columns to"

Send our dragoons in two columns to\nharass their flanks but do not let them engage hand-to-hand.” Styke was\nbeginning to wish he hadn’t sent Gustar and those hundred and fifty extra\nhorses across the river.\n“You want us to split into three groups against a superior force? Are you\nmad?”\n“Do you really need to ask? Now give the orders, Major Fles, or I’ll do\nit myself.”\nIbana fumed for a few moments. “No withdrawal?”\n“No.” Styke loosened his carbine and urged Amrec forward. “We hit\nthem now, and we hit them hard, before they can tighten their formation.”\nHe glanced over his shoulder, to where Jackal rode with the Mad Lancer\nbanner fluttering over him. “With me!” he bellowed.\nThe orders spread quickly, and the whole group sprang forward, rushing\ntoward the startlingly close Dynize. Styke prodded Amrec faster and faster.\nWithin moments he could see the confused expressions on the enemy’s\nfaces, no doubt wondering why they were being charged by a smaller force.\nHe knew that confusion, and he knew the doubt that it would sow. Are\nwe about to be flanked? the enemy would wonder. Is a large force about to\nhit us from just over that ridge? Where are our scout reports?\nStyke had no interest in giving them the chance to recover. He breathed\ndeeply, searching with his senses, and could not smell any sorcery on the\nwind. Good.\nAt forty yards he fired his carbine, then shoved it into its holster. Powder\nsmoke streamed behind his whole arrow-shaped company, and then\nhundreds of white lances lowered toward the enemy. A scattering of pistol\nshots responded from the confused enemy vanguard, before they drew their\nsabers and attempted to meet the charge.\nThe concussion of the two lines meeting was audible, and Styke was\nsoon enveloped in the enemy force. The clash of steel surrounded him,\npowder smoke filling his nostrils. Not even cuirassiers could break a Mad\nLancer charge, and their momentum carried them into the heart of the\nDynize force before Styke could sense their speed ebbing. He shouted,\nurging them on, when he felt the jolt of his lance catching something more\nthan flesh.\nThe tip snagged on the groove of a Dynize breastplate without punching\nthrough. The Dynize cavalryman jerked from his saddle, but his reins were\nwrapped around his wrist and his horse continued to gallop past Styke,\npulling its rider—and the tip of Styke’s lance—along with it.\nStyke felt the movement, but his twingy hand did not respond quickly\nenough to drop the lance. He was ripped from the saddle, spinning, and\ncould do nothing but brace himself as the earth rushed up toward him.\nCHAPTER 3\nW\nhy wasn’t this given to me immediately?” Vlora demanded.\nShe stood in the trampled grass of the river valley, her jacket soaked\nwith sweat from an afternoon of riding back and forth across the valley,\nmaking sure her defensive line was properly prepared.

Behind her, roughly two thousand men waited behind a narrow\nstrip of raised earth they’d spent the entire afternoon constructing. They\ncrouched against the muddy earthwork anticipating her orders.\nA messenger stood in front of Vlora. He wore a black jacket with a\nyellow scarf, indicating that he was one of the Blackhats the Mad Lancers\nhad recruited into their fold. She could smell the whiskey on his breath.\n“Are you going to answer me, soldier?” Vlora asked in a low tone.\nThe Blackhat opened his mouth, closed it, then opened it again. Behind\nhim, Olem stood with one hand on his pistol, his face grim, head turned to\nexamine the southern horizon.\nVlora held a message between her fingers. All it said, in a hasty scrawl,\nwas, Superior force encountered. Engaging. It was stamped with a skull and\nlance, and said the date and time. Nearly five hours ago. Vlora’s hand began\nto tremble with anger. “If you gasp at me like a fish one more time I will\nthrow you in that goddamn river with a cannonball chained to your ankle.”\n“General,” Olem said quietly.\n“I—I—I—” the messenger stuttered.\n“You what? Took a message of utmost importance from a colonel in my\narmy and rushed it back to camp? You were in such a state that you thought\nyou’d have a drink to calm your nerves before you brought this to me? And\nthen you had some more to drink, with a bloody urgent military\ncorrespondence in your pocket?”\nThe messenger gave a shaky nod.\nVlora drew a powder charge from her pocket and cut the paper with her\nthumb. She held it up to one nostril, snorting once, then followed suit with\nthe other. Her rage became distant, more controlled, like the sound of a\nriver far away, and after a few deep breaths she decided she would not kill a\nman in front of her infantry. Sights and sounds became sharper. The world\nmade more sense.\n“General,” Olem repeated in a gentle but firm tone.\n“I’m fine,” she said evenly. “Tell me,” she asked the messenger, “do you\nknow what you’ve done?”\nAnother shaky nod.\n“Do you really? Do you know the scope of this?”\n“I … I think so.” Sweat poured down the man’s face and neck.\nShe leaned forward until their faces were almost touching. “I don’t kill\nmen for incompetence, even when I want to. Even when they deserve it.\nEven when they may have just lost us a forthcoming battle. When the\nenemy comes, I expect you to be on the front line fighting like a man\npossessed. Now get out of my sight.”\nThe messenger turned and fled.\nVlora took a few moments to calm down, her mind racing as she\nattempted to adjust all her stratagems. “We spent all afternoon preparing for\nenemy infantry. Now we find out that they have proper cavalry as well.”\n“That seems to be the gist of things,” Olem agreed.\n“Have we had any messages from Styke since?”\n“None.”"

Now we find out that they have proper cavalry as well.”\n“That seems to be the gist of things,” Olem agreed.\n“Have we had any messages from Styke since?”\n“None.”\n“Shit,” Vlora breathed. “He may be dead. Captured. For all we know,\nwe’ll have five thousand enemy horses on our flank in an hour.” She closed\nher eyes. “He could have damn well said how superior their force was.”\n“I can’t imagine it was much bigger, if he engaged,” Olem said\nhopefully.\n“Mad Ben Styke charged forces several times his size during the\nFatrastan War. You think he’s mellowed with age?”\nOlem pursed his lips. “I don’t think he has.”\n“Send out our scouts. Anyone we have left with a horse. I want to know\nwhere Styke is, and I want to know where the enemy cavalry are.”\n“I already sent them.”\n“Good. What’s our last report on the Dynize main army?”\n“They’re still coming in quickly. Marching like a force possessed.”\nVlora hesitated. She didn’t know why the Dynize were moving so fast,\nbut she would use it to her benefit.\n“Did you get a confirmation on their numbers?”\n“Twenty-five thousand, give or take.” Olem hesitated. “But again, we\nhave no knowledge of their cavalry. I suggest we send five hundred of our\nreserves up to the ridge with sword-bayonets fixed. If they try to flank us\nwith cavalry, that might give them pause.”\nVlora paced back and forth. The powder trance was helping, but she still\nwanted to hiss and spit and swear. She had to keep reminding herself that\nthings could be worse. These odds—this Dynize army—it was still\nsomething she could beat. She had to beat it. “Give the order,” she\nconfirmed.\nOlem didn’t move. Something to the south had grabbed his attention.\nVlora’s pacing continued for a few more moments. “Well?” she asked.\n“What are you waiting for?”\n“They’re here.”\nThe Dynize Army came around a bend in the river, marching in the\nfootsteps of the vast migration of refugees. Vlora saw their advance force\nfirst—a few dozen cuirassiers decked out in enough silver, jade, and gold\nthat they had to be a general’s bodyguard. The infantry fanned out, and\nwithin thirty minutes the glitter of breastplates filled the river valley. The\ncadence of their march drifted to her across the wind and she could see that\nthey were deploying with an almost reckless speed.\nShe didn’t have time to wonder why.\nVlora took a deep breath and opened her third eye, fighting a wave of\nnausea. Her vision became awash with glowing pastels as she looked into a\nsorcerous mirror of the real world. She stared into the Else for almost a\nminute, ignoring the rising tension of the approaching army, searching for\nlittle flickers of light.\n“I don’t see any Privileged or bone-eyes,” Vlora finally said, closing her\nthird eye. “Just the usual smattering of Knacked.”\n“Same here,” Olem confirmed. “Nothing from Davd or Norrine, either.”\nHe sent a runner for the flanking defensive force Vlora had ordered, and"

Vlora called for her horse and mounted up, remaining\nabout fifty yards in front of her army, watching as the Dynize finished their\ndeployment.\nHer powder trance allowed her to examine the enemy as if she were\nstanding right in front of them. She looked into the eyes of the men,\nexamined their stances, their armor, their faces. It was obvious that they\nwere tired from a long, forced march up from Landfall. Some shoulders\nslumped and eyelids fluttered, but there was a resolve there she didn’t\nexpect. They were ready for a fight.\nThe absence of bone-eyes meant that Vlora could break them. But she\ndidn’t have experience fighting Dynize. She did not know how well their\ndiscipline would hold, or what actions would break their spirit.\nAnd she did not know where her—or their—cavalry were at this\nmoment. She needed a little more time.\n“I’m going to seek terms,” she told Olem. “Gather a few men.”\nVlora rode out across the valley with a small bodyguard and Olem at her\nside. A mile or so separated the two forces, giving them ample space to size\neach other up. She wondered why they hadn’t tried to take the high ground\nof the ridge, trapping the Riflejacks against the river. Perhaps they knew\nthat their cavalry would cover that flank. Perhaps they didn’t want to risk\nVlora pulling back while they maneuvered.\nOr perhaps Styke had managed to tie up their cavalry, and the Dynize\nwere just as uncertain as she was. She barely dared to hope.\nThey reached the center point between the two armies, and watched\nwhile the gaudily dressed cuirassiers rode toward them. Vlora let Olem\nwatch the enemy bodyguard and kept her eyes on the ridge. She knew it\nwas a fruitless exercise with Olem’s scouts up there now, but she couldn’t\nhelp but watch for the arrival of cavalry.\nThe Dynize came to a stop about a dozen yards away and a single horse\nrode out in front of the group. It was ridden by a middle-aged man with an\norange-lacquered breastplate and teal uniform. He sat rigidly in the saddle,\na distant expression on a gaunt face. Gold hoops and small feathers hung\nfrom his ears, and he wore silver rings mounted with human teeth. His\nfingernails were painted with gold.\n“Lady Flint,” he said in thick, if understandable, Adran.\n“I don’t believe we’ve had the pleasure,” Vlora said, eyeing the army\nover the general’s shoulder, then shifting her gaze to the man himself.\n“My name is General Bar-Levial. I command the Shrike Brigades of the\nEmperor’s Immortal Army.”\n“That’s a mouthful,” Olem muttered. He tucked a cigarette between his\nlips and lit a match.\nBar-Levial’s eyes did not leave Vlora’s face. “You seek terms?”\n“I want to know why you’re here. You hold Landfall, and the Fatrastans"

You hold Landfall, and the Fatrastans\nare no doubt pulling their armies in from the frontier, yet you’re here\nchasing the Landfall refugees as if they are important to your plans.”\n“Refugees?” Bar-Levial seemed surprised. “We don’t care about the\nrefugees. We’re here for you, Lady Flint.”\nVlora scoffed. “Me?”\n“I’m here to satisfy the honor of my emperor and his appointed\nemissary.”\n“Ka-Sedial?”\n“Yes.”\n“I …” Vlora couldn’t quite believe what she was hearing. “You’re here\nbecause I made you look like assholes at Landfall? You’re here for\nrevenge?”\nBar-Levial’s eyes narrowed. He straightened in his saddle. “I am here to\nsatisfy the honor of my emperor …”\n“Yes, yes, you mentioned that already. But you marched an entire army\nout here to find me just for revenge? Don’t you have better things to do\nwith your soldiers?” She wondered where Lindet’s field armies were at this\nmoment—Fatrasta was a young power, but they would have gathered\nthemselves by now and prepared to strike back.\n“The emperor’s armies will not stand degradation,” Bar-Levial said\ncoldly.\nBeside Vlora, Olem ashed his cigarette. “You shouldn’t take it so hard.\nYours isn’t the first army humiliated by an Adran general. It won’t be the\nlast.”\n“Silence your man, Lady Flint.”\n“Shut up.” Vlora found herself getting angry. She would meet an enemy\non any field of battle, but the idea that Ka-Sedial had sent an army after her\n—not the refugees, not to sow chaos, but specifically after her just because\nshe’d beaten him in battle—was infuriating. “I’m a mercenary, and the\nFatrastans don’t even want me anymore. What about this? How about I tell\nyou that I’m leaving the continent, and I don’t give a shit about your bloody\nwar? Will you turn around and go back to Landfall, and let me and my men\nwalk away without a fight?”\n“That changes nothing.”\n“Why?”\n“Because Ka-Sedial does not take defeat lightly. He believes that\nallowing a victorious enemy to remain victorious spells doom for an entire\ntheater of war.”\n“I’m a loose end he wants tied up?” The fact that Sedial had enough\nsoldiers he could send an entire army to deal with a loose end was rather\nterrifying.\nBar-Levial’s lip curled. “Are you afraid, Lady Flint?”\nThese Dynize were new to her—their dress and customs as alien as\nanything she’d ever seen. But she’d spent her life with arrogant generals,\nand Bar-Levial would fit in at a military ball anywhere in the Nine. “Like\nany good general, I would prefer my men live to see their homes again.”\n“The words of a coward.”\nVlora seethed inwardly. “Why are you in such a hurry?

Why force a\nbattle tonight?”\n“A friendly contest.” Bar-Levial smiled. “I shall see you on the field of\nbattle, Lady Flint, and I will take your head back to my emperor.”\n“No,” Vlora replied. “You will do no such thing.” She turned her horse\naround and rode back to her line, trying to calm herself.\nOlem caught up to her a moment later. “That was abrupt.”\n“Levial’s not going to budge, and their scouts are heading toward our\nlines. Besides, he was pissing me off.”\nShe glanced over her shoulder at those scouts. She could guess what\nthey saw from their vantage point—around two thousand riflemen, dug in\nand braced for the onslaught of a superior force. The Dynize would take\nheavy initial losses before rolling over those riflemen with ease.\nIt was precisely what Vlora wanted them to see. But if the scouts moved\nforward another half mile, it would force her to change her entire battle\nplan.\n“Do we have eyes over the ridge?” she asked.\n“We do,” Olem said. “They’ll let us know the moment anyone attempts\nto move on our flank.”\n“Good.”\nVlora had not yet reached her own lines when she heard the sound of a\ntrumpet. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw the entire Dynize Army shift,\nthe lines spreading out even farther to fill the entire valley, before lurching\nforward at another signal.\n“He really is in a hurry,” Olem commented.\n“He said something about a friendly contest. Any idea what that\nmeans?”\nOlem shook his head.\nVlora reined in her horse and turned in the saddle. She raised her arm\nhigh, pointing toward the ridge and the Dynize scouts moving along it. “I\nthink it’s time we blind them.”\nA shot rang out, quickly followed by another. Smoke rose from a copse\nof honey locusts near the ridgeline behind her own forces, and two Dynize\nscouts toppled from their horses. Two more followed, then another two. The\nshots continued every fifteen seconds or so, and Vlora watched with some\nsatisfaction as the remaining scouts realized they were being picked off and\nfled toward the main body.\nVlora finally reached her line, retreating behind the earthworks that\nsuddenly seemed so insignificant. She eyed the two thousand men she’d\npicked to hold this first line of defense. Their faces squinted against the\nmorning sun, looking to her for leadership. That in itself always seemed\nmore intimidating than the enemy armies.\n“Aim for the center of the chest,” she shouted. “Those breastplates\nmight be able to deflect a glancing shot, but they’re designed to stand up to\nsofter bullets fired with inferior powder. These poor fools weren’t at the\nBattle of Landfall. Let’s show them what they missed, shall we?”\nA cheer went up, rifles lifted into the air, then the line went deadly silent\nas the men crouched behind their earthworks and double-checked their\nweapons.\nVlora remained on horseback, pulling even farther behind the line, while\nOlem rode along the ranks shouting encouragement.

The Dynize plodded\nonward, and every so often an officer would fall into the dirt, a victim of\nVlora’s powder mages firing at will from their vantage.\nVlora searched for the general’s bodyguard as the front lines reached a\nquarter of a mile away from hers. She found the gaudy cuirassiers and Bar-\nLevial and had a brief moment of morbid curiosity. In an age of canister\nshot and sorcery, was it poor sportsmanship to aim for the enemy officers?\nPerhaps. But this was war. Kill or be killed. Bar-Levial wanted so badly to\ntake her head to his emperor, and Vlora decided not to risk giving him that\nchance. With a single thought, she set off the powder of every one of the\ncuirassiers. The sorcerous kickback nearly knocked her off her horse, and\nshe bent double to catch her breath.\nThe conflagration caused the Dynize lines to waver as the sight of their\ngeneral’s bodyguard being blown to pieces by their own powder no doubt\nmade a few mouths go dry. Cheers rose from Vlora’s own men, but she just\nsmiled coldly and hoped that one of those charred corpses belonged to that\norange-lacquered prick.\nThe Dynize kept on. A disciplined army didn’t run just because their\ngeneral died. This was just the beginning.\nAt two hundred yards, sergeants along Vlora’s lines gave the order to\nopen fire. Dynize fell to the hail of bullets, but soldiers just moved up to\ntake their place, and the army churned forward.\nAnother volley followed, then another. The Dynize reached a hundred\nyards. Vlora drew her pistol, aimed at a random officer, and put a bullet in\nhis brain with a nudge of her sorcery. Seventy-five yards. Fifty yards. The\nDynize stopped, the front line knelt, and they opened fire.\nAnyone not hunkered behind their earthworks was cut down. A second\nDynize volley fired and then a trumpet sounded, and like a slow wave\nrushing toward the beach, the Dynize infantry charged.\n“Fall back!” Olem bellowed.\nThe Riflejacks leapt to their feet and fled, running flat out from the\nDynize charge. Vlora watched, amused at the sight of the Dynize chasing\nher men, as if the two armies were playing out some coordinated game. As\nher men approached, she kicked her horse into a gallop, rushing along\nahead of them. Her horse leapt a shallow ditch and she turned once again to\nface the enemy.\nThe valley was eerily quiet. Riflejacks ran. Dynize charged. The smoke\ncleared and no bullets were fired. Her men, fresher than the Dynize,\nwidened the gap and then suddenly began to disappear, leaping into the\nsame shallow trench that she’d just crossed. When they’d all reached that\nspot of safety, a voice cut the silence. “Companies, ready!”\nA second line—two thousand more riflemen—rose from behind an\nearthwork of sod collected from the valley floor. A few yards behind them a\nthird line emerged from hiding, and then a fourth and fifth behind that,\ncomposed of the Landfall garrison and volunteers from the refugee militia."

A few yards behind them a\nthird line emerged from hiding, and then a fourth and fifth behind that,\ncomposed of the Landfall garrison and volunteers from the refugee militia.\nEach line braced itself, aiming carefully as the enemy closed the distance.\n“Fire!” Olem bellowed as his own horse cleared the ditch.\nThe first line fired and ducked. There was a pause of six or seven\nseconds, then the command came again. The second line fired and ducked,\nand the orders continued until ten thousand bullets had been sent into the\nenemy in the course of less than thirty seconds. Thousands of the Dynize\nwere swept beneath the hail. Vlora leaned forward in her saddle, silently\nurging the enemy to break. The field was suddenly obscured by powder\nsmoke, and when it cleared, she leaned back in her saddle, shaken, as she\nwatched the Dynize flood forward, climbing over the corpses of their\ncompanions.\nOlem returned to her, choking on powder smoke. “Even without sorcery,\nthese bastards are tough,” he coughed.\nAnother volley hit the Dynize lines, and a few moments later they\nfinally reached Vlora’s ditch, only to be met with a wall of fixed bayonets\nfrom her original front line.\nThe field dissolved into chaos. On her side, individual captains tried to\nkeep some sort of sustained volley fire, while others gave a “fire at will”\norder. On the Dynize side, soldiers crouched behind piles of corpses to\nshoot back, their captains rallying them with swinging sabers and then\nfalling when a powder mage shot them in the head.\n“Kresimir,” Vlora breathed. “They’re still not breaking.”\n“Even after that pummeling they outnumber us,” Olem said. He squinted\ntoward the ridge. “Only a handful of their companies are wavering. No sign\nof either of our cavalry. Should we bring our reserves to bear and try to\ncrack them?”\nFor a split second, Vlora waffled. Committing the last of her troops\nmight tip the balance. But she wanted those men free in case the Dynize had\nsomething else up their sleeves. “Not yet,” she said.\nThe center of the battle became more chaotic as both sides dissolved\ninto a bloody melee. The Riflejacks had longer bayonets, but the Dynize\nbreastplates proved more effective against those than they did against rifle\nshot, and the Dynize soon drove her front line out of the ditch. She watched,\nsnapping off a string of orders between shots from her pistol. “Bring up the\nFifty-Third to relieve the Eighth Company. Commit three platoons of the\nLandfall garrison to our eastern flank. Pull back those volunteers; they’re\nnot doing anything but shooting our own men in the back.”\nVlora set off powder when she could, blowing holes in the Dynize lines,\nbut each effort hit her hard, threatening to overwhelm and exhaust her.\nDespite the early slaughter, the battle slowly began to shift to the\nDynize. Even with their officer corps cut to ribbons, they continued to push\nforward. An hour passed, then two.

The light over the field began to wane.\nSoon her men had fallen back to the third line, and the volunteers on her\nright flank collapsed beneath a Dynize charge. Vlora called up the last of\nher reserves—two companies of Riflejacks wounded in the Battle of\nLandfall—and reluctantly sent them into the fray.\nShe leaned back in her saddle, breathing deeply of the powder smoke.\nThis was it. This was all she had. The Dynize had faced an early slaughter\nand endured, and now their more numerous troops held the battle in\nbalance.\n“Contact on the Dynize rear!” a voice shouted behind her.\nVlora tried to squint through the haze, over the sea of infantry and\ncorpses. Bleary-eyed, she spotted the movement and tried to make sense of\nit.\nCavalry. Breastplates glittered in the sun, and her breath caught in her\nthroat. Dynize cuirassiers, at least five hundred of them. They were moving\nup to assist the infantry.\nShe desperately searched for some way to counter them, hoping that her\npowder mages could at least put a dent in their morale before they arrived.\nHer eyes swept the battle, looking for the freshest company of troops she\ncould put in their path with a bayonet wall. She came up with nothing and\nturned back to the enemy, watching them helplessly. She shook her head,\nsensing something amiss. Why were they charging from the Dynize rear?\nWhy didn’t they flank her army? Beside her, Olem stood in his stirrups,\nstock-still, squinting through an eyeglass. Vlora said to him, “They’ll break\nour ranks when they get here. Pull together some of our least wounded. We\nneed to form a bayonet line.”\nOlem remained still.\n“Now, Olem!”\n“I don’t think that will be necessary,” he said.\n“Why not?”\n“Because I don’t think Dynize cuirassiers carry lances. Or ride down\ntheir own troops. Or have a big, ugly bastard leading the charge.”\nVlora felt her chest suddenly lighten and she let out an involuntary\nbreath, something between a gasp and a sigh. She sat back in her saddle.\nMad Ben Styke had arrived.\nCHAPTER 4\nS\ntyke limped slowly across the river valley as the sun set, stepping over\ncorpses, ignoring the cries of the wounded all around him. He bled from a\ndozen wounds, some of which would need stitches, and fought the\nexhaustion brought on by two tough battles in less than ten hours. His back\nand head hurt; his left shoulder had been sliced to ribbons. He wore a\ncaptured Dynize cuirass from the biggest corpse he could find, and it was\nstill a little too small around the chest, buckles poking him in the ribs.\nAnd the corpse he dragged along behind him wasn’t light.\nHis eyes passed over the bodies: Friend, foe—even some of his own\nlancers—they gave him as little pause as so much meat at a butcher. He\nwondered if there was ever a time when the sight of so much gore shocked\nhim. If there was, he couldn’t remember.

Then he thought of the wind in his hair and the thrill of the\ncharge, Amrec at a full gallop and his lance smashing through the\nbreastbone of an enemy.\nHe should get out of this business. But not yet.\nStyke caught sight of Ibana on horseback, watching passively as a\nRiflejack surgeon put a screaming Dynize soldier out of his misery. Styke\nchanged directions, heading toward her, still dragging the body. He raised\none hand in greeting.\n“There you are,” Ibana said, scowling down at him. “Where’s Amrec?”\nStyke waved vaguely toward the river. “Last I saw, he went to get a\ndrink.”\n“You’ve been unhorsed twice in a single day. And back in Landfall, too.\nPit, Ben, it’s a wonder you haven’t broken your back. You’ve got to get\nused to riding again.”\nStyke bit back a reply. She was right, of course. “It’s all about knowing\nhow to fall.”\n“Who’s that?” Ibana asked, jerking her chin toward the corpse Styke\nwas pulling along.\nThe body belonged to a middle-aged man with a gaunt face, wearing\nwhat little was left of a charred teal uniform and an orange-lacquered\nbreastplate. “Dynize general,” Styke grunted. He poked the body with his\ntoe. It was missing a chunk out of its side, right where he might have been\nwearing a pistol and a few spare powder charges. “He must have pissed off\nFlint. She’s the only one of her mages who can detonate powder at any\nsignificant range, and this guy was blown almost in half by it.”\nIbana barked a laugh. “I find myself liking Flint more and more.”\n“And here I thought you were going to kill each other sooner or later.”\n“She’s been growing on me,” Ibana replied. “But things can still change.\nWhere is she?”\nStyke pointed to a squat bit of squared stone rising from the valley floor\na few hundred yards away. A few weeks ago, he imagined it had been a\nsmall stable and waypoint for the Fatrastan messenger service, but the\nbuilding had been stripped down to the foundation by refugees looking for\nfirewood. It was currently occupied by a dozen soldiers in the crimson coats\nof the Riflejacks, with just two blue coats standing out among them—Vlora\nand Olem.\nStyke resumed his journey, dragging the corpse along behind him. It\nwould be easier, he mused, to leave the body where it lay and come find it\nlater, preferably with Amrec in tow. But there was a statement to be made\nby dragging the enemy general across the bloody field. What it was, he\nhadn’t yet decided, but he was certain it was there.\nWhen he reached the makeshift headquarters, he was surprised to find\nMajor Gustar had returned from his expedition across the river looking a\nlittle rough around the edges, and wondered if he’d managed to find an\nenemy force. The major was the first one to notice Styke, and touched the\nbrim of his bearskin hat. “Good evening, Colonel.”"

Your ride into the country?”\n“Same.”\nStyke lifted the body and draped it over the old foundation stones. The\nassembled officers fell silent, staring at Styke. Most were wounded, red-\neyed from exhaustion and powder smoke. Night was coming on quickly,\nand they all knew there would be little sleep in the aftermath of such a\nbattle. Styke was not the first Mad Lancer to arrive—Jackal stood next to\nLady Flint, his old yellow jacket hanging open to reveal a shirtless, tattooed\ntorso. The damned Palo didn’t have a cut on him.\nEyes moved from Styke to the body behind him and back.\n“Brought you a present, General,” Styke told Flint, jerking his thumb at\nthe body. “I believe that’s your handiwork.”\nSomeone gave Styke a congratulatory thump on the shoulder, and\nconversation resumed as quickly as it had stopped. He let out a small sigh,\nthankful for the familiarity. He’d spent enough of his life as a curiosity—a\nhorror, even—that he didn’t need everyone staring whenever he walked up.\nOf course, he realized wryly, dragging around a corpse probably didn’t help\nhim fit in. He limped over to Flint at her beckoning. Someone had set up\nher table and maps, along with her personal trunks.\n“Colonel Styke,” Flint said with a reserved air, bent over the table with\nboth palms flat on a map of the Hadshaw River Valley. “I want to commend\nyou on your timely arrival. I’ve been told not to inflate your ego, but it’s\nquite possible you saved the battle.”\nStyke raised his eyebrows. He’d charged the enemy rear with just seven\nhundred cavalry, most of them wounded from the fray earlier in the\nafternoon. He wouldn’t have done that if he didn’t think Flint needed it.\n“Looked like you had everything in hand.”\nFlint gave him a long, cool look that told him a thousand words. She\nknew he’d saved the battle. She knew that he knew he’d saved the battle.\nBut it was all the praise he was going to get. “Jackal here was just telling us\nof your contact with the enemy cuirassiers.

Officers had questioned his\njudgment his whole career, though few of them liked to give credit for his\nresults. Flint seemed unconcerned with the former as long as she got the\nlatter.\nShe said, “We’re going over Major Gustar’s report right now, but first I\nthink you should know how the battle went.” Her tone lowered, growing\nmore serious. “We have nine hundred dead, and over seven thousand\nwounded—many of the wounded will join the dead by the end of the week.\nWe estimate those numbers account for roughly equal numbers of\nRiflejacks, the Landfall Garrison, Blackhat volunteers, and the refugee\nmilitia.”\nStyke let out a low whistle. All things considered, if three or four\nthousand wound up dead, it was still a resounding victory. “We had a good\nlook at the battlefield as we ran them down. I think ninety-five percent of\nthe Dynize are dead or wounded.”\n“That’s our guess.”\n“Congratulations, General.” Styke found himself legitimately impressed.\n“That’s a slaughter.”\nFlint didn’t seem to share his optimism, waving off the compliment. “I\nmight enjoy it if not for the information Major Gustar just brought us.\nGustar, if you please?”\n“Thank you, ma’am.” Gustar stepped over to the map, pointing at the\nriver and addressing Styke. “As you know, you sent me over the river early\nthis morning to scout and counter any flanking force. This is where I\ncrossed. And this is where we are now.” He pointed to a third spot. “This is\nwhere I encountered an enemy force.”\n“Dynize cavalry?”\n“Yes. About fifty of them. Lightly armed, but wearing cuirasses and not\nso spongy like that vanguard we crushed. My men and I engaged. We tried\nto trap them, but they managed to slip away, and led us on a merry chase.”\nHe dragged his finger along the west side of the river, southward. “Every\ntime I ordered my men to pull back, they returned to harry our flanks, so we\nended up skirmishing with them for miles.”\nStyke scowled. “They tried to lead you into a trap.”\n“That’s what worried me, but we kept our wits about us, eyes out for\ntraps and flanking forces, and played their game. Didn’t manage to finally\ncrush them until down here.” Gustar pointed to the map again.\n“So?” Styke asked.\n“Here’s the thing—I think they were trying to lead us back to their main\nforce, but we managed to catch them just in time. Pure luck, I’ll admit, but\n—”\n“Wait,” Styke cut in. “What do you mean main force?”\nA flicker of a grim smile crossed Flint’s face. “The Second Dynize\nArmy.”\n“Shit,” Styke grunted. “A second army? Where?”\n“They were seven miles to our south,” Gustar said. “By our guess,\naround thirty-two thousand men, including around four thousand cavalry.”\nStyke caught his breath. No wonder Flint was so grim. Another, bigger\narmy marching on their position and over half of her force was wounded."

        "text": "around thirty-two thousand men, including around four thousand cavalry.”\nStyke caught his breath. No wonder Flint was so grim. Another, bigger\narmy marching on their position and over half of her force was wounded.\n“So they could be here tomorrow?” he asked.\n“Thank you, Major,” Flint said, resting a hand on Gustar’s shoulder. “Go\ncheck in with your men and get some rest. Come back to me in an hour for\na new assignment.”\nGustar snapped a salute and slipped away, leaving Styke with Flint.\nOver his shoulder, he could sense Ibana waiting and watching the\nconversation, no doubt trying to make her own plans based on that\ninformation. Jackal still stood at Flint’s side, silent and watchful, and Styke\nwondered what the Palo’s spirits would say about all this.\n“Yes,” Flint finally said, “they’ll be here tomorrow. I’ve been wondering\nall day why the enemy was in such a hurry; according to several officers we\ncaptured, Ka-Sedial ordered two different enemy generals to track down the\nRiflejacks and eliminate them. They were racing each other—trying to get\nhere first, take our heads, and claim the prize.”\n“The Dynize commander ordered it?”\n“Yes. Turns out he takes defeat very personally. The general we faced\ntoday forsook sorcerous support and marched his troops double time to get\nhere. The general we face tomorrow is … not so foolhardy.” Flint was silent\nfor several moments, looking at her maps, before finally saying in a low\nvoice, “We can’t fight that.”\n“Do you have a plan?”\n“At this point? Not much of one. The Dynize are here to avenge the\nhumiliation we gave them at Landfall. This second general will be more\ncautious than the first, but once he finds out how few fighting men we have\nleft, he’s going to pounce. If he takes his time to scout us out, we have just\nthree days to prepare.”\nStyke resisted the urge to repeat his question. He could sense Ibana’s\neyes on him, and he knew what she’d say—cut our losses and run. Get the\nMad Lancers out of here before they encountered something they couldn’t\ncut through with brute force.\nFlint continued. “We’re going to pull our men back to the refugee camp.\nAssuming the Dynize take their time, that’ll put a few more miles between\nus. We’re going to leave their dead and wounded for them to clean up.\nMaybe give them some pause.” She shrugged.\n“But you intend to fight?”\nFlint lifted her gaze, looking Styke in the eye. “If I have to. I’m open to\nother options, but with so many wounded I don’t think we could slip away\neven if we got the opportunity. The only good news in all of this is that the\nDynize aren’t really interested in the refugees. So at least we needn’t worry\ntoo much about shielding them.” There was a sour note in her voice, and\nStyke realized that for all her heroics she was not pleased with the idea of\ndying on foreign soil protecting foreign refugees.\nMercenaries were, of course, paid to die on enemy soil. Flint didn’t\nseem to think that applied to her—not because she could weasel out of\nassignments, like so many mercenaries, but because she genuinely believed"

Flint didn’t\nseem to think that applied to her—not because she could weasel out of\nassignments, like so many mercenaries, but because she genuinely believed\nshe would win every fight. Styke wondered if it was confidence or\narrogance. Probably a bit of both. But he was the last person in the world in\na position to make that judgment.\nFlint fell into a sullen silence, staring at the map beneath her hands.\nStyke touched his forehead and backed away. “I’m going to find my horse\nand regather the lancers. We captured a lot of Dynize horses. We’ll get to\nwork making sledges and do what we can to move wounded back to the\nrefugee camp.”\n“Very good,” Flint said absently.\nHe left her to brood and returned to Ibana, who looked none too pleased\nherself. “We have to talk,” Ibana said.\nStyke lifted the body of the enemy general onto his shoulder and began\nto walk. “I have to get my horse.”\nIbana rode along beside him until they were well out of earshot of Flint,\nthen said, “We should get out while we still can.”\n“I think we’re past that point already.”\n“We’re not Riflejacks. We’re not Adrans. We can slip away tonight and\nno one left alive by the end of the week will even remember.”\nThe thought was both repellent and attractive to Styke. Ibana was right\nthat they weren’t precisely Riflejacks. The Mad Lancers had ties to Fatrasta,\neven after all Fidelis Jes had done to destroy them, and if the Riflejacks\nmanaged to slip away and head back to the Nine, the Mad Lancers would\nlikely remain here.\n“We’ve fought beside them for three weeks. We’ve taken Flint’s money.\nThat’s enough for us to see this through.”\n“And see us all dead,” Ibana retorted.\nStyke stopped, looking up the river, then back down it. He kicked at the\nmuddy, bloody ground with one toe and decided he was close enough to the\nhighway. “Give me your spare lance.”\n“Excuse me?”\nStyke reached up to her saddle and took it. He placed it handle-first\nagainst the ground and pushed, leaning on it until it was buried almost two\nfeet into the soft mud. Once it was in place, he lifted the corpse of the\nDynize general under the armpits, like lifting a child onto horseback, and\nthen dropped it. The tip of the lance entered the small of his back and easily\nslid up the neck and out the top of his head, leaving the body with arms\nslumped like a scarecrow over a bloody field.\n“Macabre,” Ibana noted.\n“Give the soldiers of that new army something to think about.”\n“You’re really going to stick around for Flint, are you?”\nStyke admired his handiwork, wiping his hands off on his pants. “Where\nis Celine?” he asked.\n“You’re avoiding the question.”\n“And I want to know where Celine is.”\n“She’s with Sunin. I saw the two of them up on the ridge half an hour\nago. Now answer my question.”"

Now answer my question.”\nStyke searched the ridgeline. “I need to find a horse for Celine,” he\nmused. “She’s plenty old enough.”\n“Ben …”\nHe waved her off. “I’ll think about it. We’re sticking around for now.\nAttend to our wounded, and keep everyone on their toes in case I change\nmy mind.”\nIbana finally nodded, seemingly content with the idea of a contingency\nplan. “We lost twenty or so of old bodies and maybe sixty of the new ones.\nMore are wounded. You want me to try to fill our numbers from the\nrefugees?”\n“Sure.”\n“Okay, I’ll …” Ibana trailed off. “Who is that?”\nStyke turned to follow her gaze, and was surprised to see a dozen horses\nswimming across the current of the Hadshaw River. It was almost dark, and\nit was difficult to see their riders clearly until they reached the close bank of\nthe river. The riders wore sunflower-yellow cavalry jackets just like Ibana\nand Styke, but Styke had never seen these men before. He was suddenly\napprehensive, resting his hand on the hilt of his boz knife as they made their\nway toward Styke, coming to a stop with horses dripping.\nThe man at their front wore a colonel’s stars at his lapel. He was young\nand fresh-faced, no more than twenty-five, and he examined Styke’s old\ncavalry jacket with a troubled expression. After a few moments of silence,\nhe finally cleared his throat. “I’m looking for General Vlora Flint.”\n“Who are you?”\n“Colonel Willis of the Eighteenth Brigade.”\nStyke shared a long look with Ibana. “Did Lindet finally send some\nsoldiers to help us fight this thing?”\n“She did,” Colonel Willis said, stiffening.\n“I hope it’s more than a brigade,” Ibana said.\nWillis scoffed. “A brigade? The Second Field Army of Fatrasta is\ncamped about ten miles from here.”\nStyke felt a laugh bubble up from his stomach and escape his lips. He\nbent over, slapping his knee.\n“I’m not sure what’s so funny,” Willis said.\n“What’s funny,” Styke said, wiping his face, “is that we could have used\nyou twenty-four hours ago.” He couldn’t help but wonder if this field army\nhad planned on being late, hoping the Dynize would wipe out the\nRiflejacks. It was something Lindet would do.\n“I can see that,” Willis said, sparing a decidedly haughty glance for the\nbattlefield.\n“Did you know there’s another thirty thousand Dynize camped just\nsouth of here?”\nWillis pursed his lips. “We’ve been informed, yes. But that’s not my\nconcern.”\n“Then what is?”\n“I’m here to arrest General Flint.”\nCHAPTER 5\nM\nichel Bravis crouched in the doorway of a boarded-up shop in the\nnorthern suburbs of the city of Landfall.

        "text": "northern suburbs of the city of Landfall. His eyes were blurry from lack of\nsleep and more than a few too many swigs from the flask in his jacket\npocket. The air reeked of the dead morass of the nearby fens, and\nsomewhere in the distance a pack of dogs began to bay and yip. A single\npistol shot rang out, and they were silenced.\nThe city was eerily quiet, and he wondered just how many of the\nresidents had managed to flee before the Dynize Army occupation. It\nseemed as though half the homes and businesses on any given street were\nabandoned. It was too quiet, even for this late hour of the night, and Michel\nhad a constant, twisting pain in the pit of his stomach from the realization\nthat this was no longer the city he had grown up in—the city he had sworn\nto two different masters that he would protect.\nHe tried to tell himself that Fatrasta had recovered from their war for\nindependence from the Kez. They’d lost Landfall before, and regained it.\nBut a voice in the back of his head told him that this was different—that\neverything had changed—and he had to constantly fight a rising terror.\nMichel took a swig from his flask, grimacing at the bitter taste of the\nwhiskey, and gave it a shake. Just a few more swallows, and he’d be out of\nliquid courage for the night.\n“You don’t have time to be a coward, Michel,” he told himself.\n“Easy for you to say,” he whispered back. “You’re getting drunk.”\n“No, I am perfectly sober.”\nHe squeezed his eyes shut. “No one should have to be perfectly sober in\na city occupied by an enemy force.” He opened one eye hesitantly,\nsquinting into the street, where the only light came from a single gas lantern\nfifty yards down the cobbles. His ears picked up a sound and he tilted his\nhead toward the street, trying to make it out.\nHe was soon able to recognize the tramp of boots, and he willed himself\nfarther into the darkness of the doorway of the boarded-up store. He heard\nan authoritative shout in a foreign language, and a few moments later a\nplatoon of Dynize soldiers marched into view, bathed in the light of that\nsingle lantern.\nIt was a strange procession: men and women with fire-red hair, pale\nskin, and ashen freckles, armed with outdated muskets and curved\nbreastplates, wearing old-fashioned morion helms with their finned, kettle-\nhat shape. Their uniforms were turquoise, decorated with colorful feathers\nand bleached-white human and animal bones. The word “exotic” came to\nmind, but it was a word often associated with “quaint,” and the army that\nhad occupied Landfall was anything but that.\nA soldier at the front, his breastplate decorated with a lacquered crimson\nstripe, called out an order and the platoon turned left at the lantern, heading\ndown the street toward Michel. He inhaled sharply, fighting the urge to\nreach for his flask, knowing that any movement might attract the eye of a\npassing soldier.\nAs the Dynize patrol drew closer, Michel whispered to himself under his\nbreath. “My name is Pasi. I am an Adran immigrant whose wife and\nchildren left the city before the invasion. I came down from the plateau to"

I came down from the plateau to\nscavenge and was caught out after curfew. I am waiting out the night so I\ncan return home in the morning.” He repeated the alibi to himself twice\nmore and fell silent, hugging the arms of his threadbare wool jacket and\nwaiting for one of the soldiers to spot him.\nThey marched by, close enough he could have reached them in three\nstrides. Soldiers glanced in alleyways, doors, and toward dark windows, but\nno one cried out, and the platoon did not stop.\nMichel waited until they had turned the next corner before he allowed\nhimself a sigh of relief and the tiniest sip from his flask. “Bloody pit,” he\nwhispered. “That was a heart attack I didn’t need.” He put his hand on his\nchest until he could feel the thumping of his heart steady out. He settled into\na more comfortable position to wait.\nHe remained in the doorway for over forty minutes, frequently squinting\nthrough the dark at his pocket watch, until a figure emerged from the\nshadows of the alleyway across the street.\n“Bloskin!” a voice called out, wavering.\nMichel tensed, ready to run if his rendezvous had somehow turned into\nan ambush. “It’s a good night to see a friend,” Michel responded. The figure\nhesitated, as if checking the code words against her memory, then came far\nenough into the street so that Michel could make out some of her features.\nShe had long, dirty-blond hair and a heavy brow, her nose and cheeks\nbroad. Michel wouldn’t have wanted to meet her in a dark alley.\nAnd yet, he realized with in inward laugh, here he was doing just that.\n“Over here,” he called.\nThe woman joined him in the doorway, pressing herself into the\ndarkness. “You’re Bloskin?” she asked.\nAnother of Michel’s aliases. He wondered how many he’d gained just in\nthe last three weeks since the occupation, and hoped that he’d be able to\nkeep them all straight. “I am.”\n“Hendres sent me. My name is Kazi Fo—”\n“Wait,” Michel said, pressing a finger to her lips. “Don’t tell me your\nfull name. In fact, don’t tell anyone your real name, if you can help it. Not\non a night like this. Where are they?”\n“I left them across the street. I wanted to make sure it was safe.”\n“Well done. You told them my name?”\n“I told them you are Bloskin, a Blackhat Bronze Rose. I told them you\nknew their mother.”\nMichel squinted at her. “Are you a Blackhat?”\n“An Iron Rose. But I don’t have it with me. It’s hidden.”\n“Good. Don’t show that Rose to anyone. It’s too dangerous. Why didn’t\nyou leave the city during the invasion?”\nKazi glanced back into the street, taking a half step away from Michel.\nHe could practically feel her distrust.

The invasion and subsequent occupation had changed\nall the old rules. “You don’t have to tell me anything about yourself,”\nMichel reassured. “I was just curious. We all have our reasons.”\n“Yes, we do,” Kazi said, her tone standoffish.\nMichel needed trust right now, people he could depend on. But his list of\ntrusted contacts was pitifully small, so why should hers be any longer? If he\nwanted to know more about Kazi, he’d have to ask their mutual contact.\n“Get out of here,” he said. “Get some sleep. There will be more families\ntomorrow.” He grabbed her sleeve as she turned to go. “Cover your head.\nYour hair stands out in the darkness. Also, careful of the patrols. They’re\nchanging up their routes.”\nHe waited until Kazi had headed back toward the secret paths up to the\nLandfall plateau, before crossing the street and entering the alley she’d\nemerged from a few minutes prior. The alley was littered with old crates,\nbarrels, and other refuse, and he couldn’t immediately pick out anyone\nhiding there.\n“I’m Bloskin,” he said in a loud whisper. “Kazi has gone home. You’re\nwith me now.”\nSlowly, figures emerged from their hiding places. The first was a man,\nmedium height with long, dark hair under a flatcap. He held a bundle in his\narms, which Michel quickly realized was a child, no more than a year old.\nFive more children of various ages followed.\n“Kazi said you know my wife,” the man whispered urgently.\nPart of Michel’s job as a spy had always been knowing when to tell the\ntruth and when to lie—and when to walk the gray places in between. “I\ndon’t, actually. I don’t know who you are, except that your wife is a Silver\nRose, and we need to get you out of the city. That’ll have to be good\nenough, unless you want to risk the Dynize purges.”\nThe children huddled around their father, who seemed at a loss. He\nlooked around at the waiting faces before finally nodding at Michel. “We\ndon’t have any choice but to trust you. But this is my family. If you so much\nas—”\n“Don’t threaten me,” Michel said with a tired sigh. “It’s childish. You\ncan either let me do my job, or I can go find somewhere to sleep. Now, are\nwe getting you out of the city or not?”\n“Is Bloskin even your real name?” the father asked. Michel could hear\nthe tension in his voice, and he wished that for once this process could be\nsimple.\n“No, and I suggest you not tell me yours.” Michel squinted at his pocket\nwatch, trying to discern the time in the darkness. “Kazi got you here late, so\nif we’re going to go, we need to do it now. Make a decision.”\nThe father’s mouth formed a hard line. “We’ll go.”\n“Right, follow me. And no one make a peep.”\nMichel led the family back the way they’d come and began to cross"

And no one make a peep.”\nMichel led the family back the way they’d come and began to cross\nstreets and duck through alleys in a pattern that might look to an observer to\nbe entirely random. They crisscrossed their own path several times, but he\nled them steadily north through the suburbs until the streets began to widen\nand the tenements and stores began to thin. They were soon among small,\ntwo-story houses, ducking through one of the many Palo quarters of the\ncity, where the streets weren’t cobbled, the gutters were filled with trash,\nand the Dynize patrols were fewer.\nFor eight nights Michel had done a variation of the same route—\ncarefully planned out during the day—and managed not to cross paths with\na single Dynize patrol. On this night, however, the patrols were constant\nand the group was forced to hide almost every hour.\nThey waited for the third of the patrols to pass by, crouching beneath\none of the stilted houses on the floodplains north of the city. Over a hundred\nstrong, and led by a soldier whose breastplate was lacquered black, the\npatrol carried torches, which they thrust into the alleys and under the houses\nas they went, and Michel quietly urged the children to move farther into the\ndarkness.\n“They’ve changed the routes,” Michel whispered to the father. He swore\nto himself and listened to the ticking of his watch in his breast pocket,\nknowing time was running short.\n“What does that mean?”\n“I don’t know. Could be they’re getting wise to people leaving the city.\nCould be that they just change their routine every week or so. Either way,\nit’s going to be more and more dangerous to leave the city from here on\nout.”\n“Are we going to be able to get out?” There was a tinge of desperation\nto the father’s voice.\nMichel hesitated. If he was smart, he’d leave the seven of them here to\ntry and make it on their own. He’d flush his safe house in Upper Landfall,\ncut off his contacts with Hendres, Kazi, and anyone else, and find the\ndeepest hole in Greenfire Depths to wait out this occupation.\nHe didn’t need to help these people. His own mother was safely out of\nthe city, and as a spy he’d never been close to anyone else.\nBut despite his alternate loyalties, he didn’t believe anyone deserved to\nbe snatched up by foreign occupiers, least of all children.\n“You’ll get out,” Michel finally said. “But we have to move fast.” The\npatrol passed, and Michel led the family out from beneath the stilted\nhouses. He picked up the smallest of the children, cradling her face against\nhis neck, then began to hurry them all along at a quicker pace. They crossed\nthe sandiest, deepest part of the floodplains and entered the fens. The\nwetlands were bisected by hundreds of drainage ditches built by convicts in\nthe labor camps. The ditches made poor highways, but it kept them out of\nsight of the road as they moved farther and farther away from the city.\nWet, muddy, and stinking, the group emerged on the opposite side of the\nfens and crossed the final highway before the coastal plains became cotton"

As in the city, patrol\nfrequency out here had increased, and it wasn’t until Michel and his charges\nwere hiding in a farmer’s shed on the northern side of the highway that he\nallowed himself to breathe a sigh of relief.\nOutside, the sky was beginning to lighten. It would be daybreak soon,\nand that would complicate his return to the city. He glanced at the small\nfaces huddled in the shed, and then at the father, whose eyes were tired and\nhis expression bleak. “How much farther?” the father asked.\n“Until what?” Michel responded. “Safety? Long time until then.” He\nheard the bitter note in his voice and silently scolded himself. He was here\nto help, not deepen the man’s fears. “Sorry,” he said in a gentler voice.\n“This is as far as I take you. I’ve got to get back before it’s light. You’ll\nhead about two miles due north. There’s a farmhouse with distinct yellow\npaint on the east wall. They’ll hide you for a day, and tomorrow night get\nyou to a carriage that will take you along the back roads and safely out of\nrange of the Dynize patrols.”\nThere was a long silence, and Michel could see the man steeling himself\nto try and herd six children across two miles of open land before the sun\ncame up. Michel didn’t envy him the task.\n“How can I thank you?” the father asked.\nThe question surprised Michel. Most of these smuggled families were so\nexhausted by the trek that good-bye was a simple nod and then\ndisappearance into the dark. “Just … if you find your wife, or reach the\narmies, or the Lady Chancellor or anyone, you can tell them that people are\nstill fighting in Landfall. And we’d rather not be abandoned.”\n“Come with us,” the father said. “If an escape route can take seven, it\ncan surely take eight.”\nThe offer was tempting. But Michel had made his decision. He was\ngoing to stay in Landfall through this thing, for good or ill. There were\nmore people to keep out of Dynize hands. He slapped the father on the\nshoulder. “Get moving. If daylight hits you, find a ditch to hide in. Watch\nthe horizon for patrols. Remember that the farmhouse you’re looking for\nhas a yellow wall.”\nThe father nodded, and Michel opened the shed door and watched the\nsilent, frightened children file out and follow their father into the cotton\nfields. Michel watched them merge into the night, then turned back toward\nLandfall.\nFrom here, the massive Landfall Plateau and the city that covered its\nface and skirted its knees seemed almost peaceful. There was no sign of the\nbombardment that had scarred the eastern face of the plateau, or the rancid\nsmoke of the fires to the south where bodies were still being dumped.

Better to escape now, while escape was still an option, a small\nvoice told him. “Stop being a coward,” he told it. Taking his last swallow of\nwhiskey, he crossed the highway and headed back into the fens to make his\nway toward the city.\nCHAPTER 6\nM\nichel jerked awake, reaching for the pistol on the bedside table,\nknocking an empty wine bottle and his pocket watch to the floor with a\nclatter that made his head hurt. He fumbled for a grip and sat up in bed,\npointing the pistol toward the doorway, his head hammering in his chest and\nhis eyes crossed badly.\n“It’s me,” a voice said gently.\nMichel took several deep breaths and lowered the pistol. “Sorry,” he\nsaid. “Nerves a little frayed.”\nHendres stepped inside the tiny room that she and Michel shared in a\ntenement on the south side of the gorge in Upper Landfall. Hendres was\nyoung—or at least what Michel thought of as young, though in her\nmidtwenties she was probably just as old as he. She had brown hair, cut\nshort beneath a bowler cap, and wore a reddish-brown day laborer’s suit\nmuch the same as Michel’s. Her face had old pockmarks down the left side.\nShe had intelligent eyes and a military bearing about her, and had somehow\nmanaged to make the rank of Silver Rose in the secret police despite her\nyoung age.\nMichel knew how hard that was from experience.\nHendres closed the door behind her and touched the empty wine bottle\nwith her toe. “I have no idea how you keep finding something to drink. The\nDynize have put the squeeze on everything going in and out of the city, and\nthe booze seems to have disappeared first.”\n“I, uh, know a lot of bartenders,” Michel responded. “Most of them owe\nme a favor or two. He squinted at the pistol in his hand. The pan wasn’t\neven primed. He sighed and set it on the bedside table.\n“You’re a bit shaky with a pistol,” Hendres observed.\n“Guns aren’t really my thing,” he said, trying to rub the sleep from his\neyes and the headache from his brain. He looked at his empty flask sitting\non the washstand across the room. “Pit, you’re a terrible spy,” he muttered.\n“You should not be drinking.”\n“What’s that?”\n“Nothing, nothing.”\nHendres moved to sit on the edge of the bed, then suddenly recoiled.\n“By Adom, what’s that smell?”\n“Had to go across the fens last night to get that family out.”\n“I thought we agreed you were going to wash before coming to bed. You\nknow I have to sleep here too, right?”\n“Sorry,” Michel said, though he didn’t feel it. “Got caught out near dawn\nbecause your courier showed up forty minutes late. And the bloody Dynize\nchanged their patrol routes.”\nHendres pulled a face and finally sat down beside him. They’d known\neach other for all of three weeks—Hendres was one of the regiment of"

They’d known\neach other for all of three weeks—Hendres was one of the regiment of\nBlackhats that had stayed behind to help hold the city after the Grand\nMaster was killed by Styke. She’d returned with Michel to try and make a\ndifference during the Dynize occupation.\nThey’d spent the first week hiding—and screwing—in a Blackhat safe\nhouse before the occupying forces finally instilled order on the city. Since\nthen their relationship had cooled to purely professional, and Michel was\nglad for it. He already liked Hendres for her competence and her lack of\nquestions. He didn’t need to get any more attached.\n“Someone threw a bunch of grenades into a crowd of Dynize soldiers,”\nHendres said.\n“So?”\n“That’s probably why they changed the routes. It killed three of them,\ninjured twenty more.”\n“Pit.” Michel scratched his head vigorously with both hands, trying to\nwake up. “Someone” could be other Blackhats, or partisan Fatrastans, or\njust Palo trying to stir up chaos. It meant bad things for his and Hendres’s\nefforts. “What time is it?”\n“Half past one.”\n“Where have you been all morning?”\nHendres sighed, picking at something on her sleeve. “Setting up the next\nfamily to get out. And trying to find out how many of us are left.”\nBy “us,” she meant Blackhats. “Yeah? Any progress?” Michel didn’t\nwant to make contact with any more Blackhats. Someone higher up the\nfood chain might know about his betrayal. But he couldn’t very well tell\nHendres that.\n“Some. There’s rumors, but everyone is laying low. As far as I can tell,\nmost of the higher-ranking Roses left the city with Lindet.”\n“And abandoned their families in the process,” Michel said, unable to\nhelp the note of bitterness in his voice. He shouldn’t blame everyone who\nabandoned the defense of the city. They were only following orders. But he\nwasn’t inclined to feel kindly toward men and women who’d left their\nfamilies to the mercy of an enemy army.\nHendres remained silent. They’d had this discussion several times, and\nshe was obviously conflicted regarding her loyalty to the Lady Chancellor.\nLoyalty was meant to come unquestioning to a Blackhat. This war made\nthings … complicated.\nMichel waved the thought away. “But we’re here to take care of those\nfamilies,” he said, throwing back the thin covers and sitting up. He caught a\nwhiff of himself—and the fens he’d dragged himself through to get home\nthis morning—and almost passed out again. Hendres dashed to the\ndoorway, covering her nose.\n“Go wash. Now!”\n“I will, I will!” Michel searched for his pants. “You sound like my\nmother,” he muttered.\n“I what?”\n“Nothing!” Michel dressed quickly and headed into the hall, ready to go\nfind a public bath. He leaned against the wall, trying not to get dizzy, and\nwondered where he’d find some breakfast. Food was already becoming a\nproblem, what with the Dynize closing the port, and it would only get worse\nas the occupation went on.\nHendres joined him, keeping her distance. He opened one eye and"

He opened one eye and\ncaught her staring at him. “What?”\nShe shifted her feet. “You’re being careful, right?”\n“At night? Of course.”\n“You’re changing your route out of the city every time?”\nHe hadn’t been. “I am. I mean, I will tonight. Best not to take any risks\nwith the patrol routes changing.”\nThere was a long moment of silence, and Hendres continued to stare.\n“You’re being followed.”\n“Excuse me?”\nHendres reached into her breast pocket and produced an envelope. It\nwas sealed with wax. “A Palo kid was waiting outside the building this\nmorning. He handed me this, and said to give it to you.”\n“By name?” Michel asked, his heart jumping into his throat. He had\nbeen careful—very careful—every time he returned to the safe house. There\nwas no way he was followed.\n“By name,” Hendres confirmed, watching his face intently.\nMichel took the envelope and broke the seal. He was fully awake now,\nlike he’d downed six cups of iced coffee, and he bit his lip as he read the\nnote. It was just an address, followed by a time. Two o’clock. At the bottom\nwas a single letter “T.” Michel took a deep breath to calm himself.\n“Are we found?” Hendres asked.\n“We’re fine,” Michel responded. “What time did you say it was?”\n“A little past one.”\nHis chest feeling tight, Michel headed down the hall. “I’ve got to go,” he\ncalled over his shoulder. “If I’m not back in a couple hours, you should\nleave the city.”\n“Do you need backup?” Hendres asked, a note of concern in her voice.\n“Wouldn’t help!” Michel reached the street, looking for a hackney cab,\nthen remembered they were few and far between since the occupation. He\nshaded his eyes against the hot afternoon sun, pulled his collar up, and went\nto see Taniel.\nMichel crossed the city on foot. With no functional government to pay the\npig keepers or the sweepers, the gutters overflowed with shit and trash.\nEvery third person seemed to be a Dynize soldier, while the citizens who\nwould not—or could not—flee with Lady Flint’s army went about their\ndays with eyes cast toward the ground, fear writ plain on their faces. The\nentire city felt subdued.\nRubble spilled into the street, and whole blocks had burned down in the\nfires caused by rioters and shelling. Only a concerted effort by volunteer\nfire brigades had kept the entire city from going up in smoke, though there\nwere places where the smell of soot was so thick no one dared go out\nwithout a handkerchief over their face.\nMichel lowered his eyes and tipped his hat to every passing Dynize\npatrol. The strangely armored soldiers rarely took an interest in one man,\nand moved through the city as a show of force, rather than any real policing\naction. He was able to reach Greenfire Depths without incident and he\nrounded the rim of the great old quarry, eyeing the smoke that still rose\nfrom the charred remains of the slum."

        "text": "action. He was able to reach Greenfire Depths without incident and he\nrounded the rim of the great old quarry, eyeing the smoke that still rose\nfrom the charred remains of the slum.\nOver half the tenements in the Depths had been destroyed by fire.\nSurviving Palo huddled in the few open spaces at the bottom of the quarry,\nsome even spilling out on the rim. Rumors swirled about desperate Palo\nlooting the homes and businesses of the people who had fled, and Michel\ncould not find the energy to be surprised—or to blame them.\nThese were not times, he decided, that he would judge any man for\nacting in fear.\nAround the northern rim of the Depths, he reached the address indicated\nin the note. Instead of finding the Hotel Henria—which had stood for over a\nhundred years and was ancient by the standards of the young country—he\nfound only its charred stone foundation.\nMichel passed the blackened stone, confused, and wondered if perhaps\nhe’d read the address wrong. There was barely anything left of the place,\nand the little passing traffic paid it no mind. No one had any time for a\nburned relic.\nHe checked the note in his pocket, then glanced at his watch. Five\nminutes after two. And yes, this was the right address. Perhaps, he decided,\nthe note had been delivered a couple of weeks late? This kind of\ncommunication was not always reliable.\nHe hid in the shadows of the ruin while a squad of Dynize soldiers\nmarched past, their breastplates gleaming in the sun, colorful feathers\nhanging from their shouldered muskets. Once they’d gone, he decided to\nhave one quick look around before heading back to the safe house.\nHe’d only climbed onto the lowest of the foundation stones when a\nfigure caught his eye. He let a half smile cross his face and carefully picked\nhis way through the unstable ruin to where the former southern wall of the\nhotel perched on the very edge of Greenfire Depths.\nA man sat on the burned-out foundation, the back of an expensive suit\npressed carelessly against bricks blackened by smoke and soot. He was tall,\nworn but handsome, with hawkish features and striking blue-gray eyes. His\nblack hair was hidden beneath a top hat, and one leg dangled carelessly off\nthe two-hundred-foot drop into the quarry. He held a weathered old\nsketchbook in one hand and a bit of charcoal in the other, and as Michel\napproached, he could see a rather good rendition of the Depths.\nThe man was fair-skinned, but the hand clutching the charcoal was a\nbright red, the skin hairless and smooth like a child’s.\n“I didn’t know you still kept a sketchbook,” Michel said.\nTaniel Two-shot, the Red Hand terror of the Fatrastan frontier, squinted\ndown into the fire-ravaged slums of the Depths and made a few quick\nmarks in his sketchbook before flipping it closed and stowing it in a leather\nvalise. He pulled a glove over his right hand, then picked up a silver-headed\ncane and pointed it at Michel. “You’re late.” He crinkled his nose. “And\nyou smell.”\n“Everyone’s a critic,” Michel muttered. Louder, he said, “I wasn’t\nexpecting to meet in a ruin.”"

        "text": "you smell.”\n“Everyone’s a critic,” Michel muttered. Louder, he said, “I wasn’t\nexpecting to meet in a ruin.”\n“Ah, right.” Taniel grimaced. “I wasn’t expecting that either, to be\nhonest. You know, Pole and I stayed here for several months when we first\ncame back to Fatrasta. Third floor, corner suite.”\nMichel glanced around, half expecting to find Taniel’s silent companion\nlurking in the ruins of the hotel. “Where is she?”\n“Hiding outside the city. Landfall is crawling with bone-eyes. Pole may\nbe able to turn a god inside out with raw power, but she’s all self-taught. We\ndon’t want to risk the Dynize finding her until we’re ready for a serious\nfight.”\nThe thought both scared and exhilarated Michel. “Makes sense. So what\nbrings you back? I thought you two left with Lady Flint.”\nTaniel stood up, balancing on the foundation stones, hopping from one\nfoot to the other before glancing down at the long drop and stepping into\nthe safety of the ruin of the hotel. He brushed a bit of soot off his sleeve—a\nwasted effort, because he was covered in it. “Never left.”\nMichel made a noise in the back of his throat and pursed his lips.\n“You’ve been here for three weeks? You’re joking.”\n“Afraid not. Lindet abandoned the city. The Dynize, despite all their\nspies, really have no idea what they’re getting into. It was too good an\nopportunity for me to do some poking around.”\nMichel paced back and forth, kicking a loose brick into the ruins of what\nhad once been the hotel’s wine cellar. The brick clanked twice, then\nshattered a bottle. Three weeks of flailing around, helping the Blackhats\nbecause those were the only allies he knew, worried one of them would find\nout who he really was and put a knife in his back. All while his real master\nwas wandering around the very same city. Michel talked himself down from\nshouting and simply said, “You could have told me.”\nTaniel eyed him. Two-shot could be warm as a brother, or very very\ncold. This time he offered a neutral shrug. “I had no idea where you were. I\ncould have used your help sorting through Blackhat files. It wasn’t until\nyesterday that one of my contacts was able to track you down.”\n“Right.” Michel wondered whether to believe him. Master or not, Taniel\nhad his own agenda. It was kept secret for good reason, but it didn’t make it\nany easier when Michel was left in the dark. “So what happens now?”\n“I understand you’re still with the Blackhats?”\n“I’ve bunked up with a Silver Rose. We’ve spent the last week or so\ntrying to get Blackhat families out of the city before the Dynize agents find\nand kill them.”\n“Commendable.” Taniel stared at him for several moments, until the\nsilence grew awkward. “Do the Blackhats know you betrayed them?” he\nfinally asked.\n“I don’t think so,” Michel responded hesitantly. “Hendres—the Silver\nRose I’m working with—knows that Fidelis Jes wanted me dead before"

But I don’t think she knows why. The fact that I’m\nhere, helping the Blackhats, seems to be enough for her. It seems I’m still a\nGold Rose.”\nThe silence returned, punctuated only by the sound of Taniel tapping his\ncane against a brick. After half a minute, he seemed to come to some sort of\ndecision. “Are you still my man?” he asked.\nMichel opened his mouth, but found himself unable to respond. He\nworked his lips for several moments, fighting back the urge to punch Taniel\nin the mouth. “I spent six years dirtying my hands for the Blackhats on your\norders.” His voice rose in pitch. “I betrayed the most dangerous man in the\ncountry for the Red Hand. I …”\n“Ah,” Taniel said gently. “I’m not trying to offend you, honestly. I\nneeded to ask. The world is … volatile right now.”\n“I’m still your man,” Michel answered sharply. “And I’ll ask you kindly\nnot to question that again.” The fact that Taniel even felt the need to ask\nsmarted, but he tried to remember that this was a game much bigger than\neither of them. Infiltrating the Blackhats had been the greatest\naccomplishment—and danger—of Michel’s life. Now with the Dynize in\nplay, well … Taniel was right. Everything had changed.\n“I won’t. I need you to remain in the city.”\nMichel had planned on staying in the city to help the Blackhats, but the\nrequest still surprised him. “For what?”\nTaniel pursed his lips thoughtfully, staring off into the distance for a few\nmoments. “I need you to do something dangerous.”\n“You’ll have to be more specific.”\n“There’s a … woman. Ka-poel and I have been in contact with her off\nand on throughout the last few years, and she’s fed us information regarding\nthe Dynize.”\nMichel turned his head. “What do you mean by that? No one knows\nanything about the Dynize, not before they arrived on our shores. Any\ninformation you can dig up in Fatrasta is from before they closed their\nborders—at least a hundred years old. How could you …?” The dots\nconnected in his head and he found his mouth hanging open. “You had a\nspy in Dynize?”\nTaniel idly tapped his cane against a blackened foundation stone. “We\ndid. Only Ka-poel and I know, and I’d like it to stay that way.”\n“Kresimir on a stick, Taniel. If you had a spy in Dynize, how the pit\ndidn’t you know that there was an invasion coming?”\n“We suspected the invasion.”\n“And didn’t tell me.”\n“Couldn’t risk distracting you.”\nFirst Taniel questioned his loyalty, and now this. “You didn’t answer my\nquestion.”\n“She’s not …” Taniel sighed. “She’s fed us information, but she’s not a\nspy—not in the same way you are. She’s still a loyal Dynize. She didn’t tell\nus when, exactly, the invasion would happen because she hasn’t been in"

But over the last few weeks she’s gotten back in\ntouch with us.”\n“And?”\nTaniel held up two fingers. “A couple things. One, she knows an\nimmense amount about the Dynize hierarchy. She knows some of their\nplans, and most of their strengths and weaknesses, which makes her wildly\nvaluable. Two, we think she’s in danger. I need you to find her, convince her\nto leave, and extract her from the city.”\nMichel ran his hands through his hair. “Excuse me?”\n“Find her and extract her.”\n“Yes, I heard the first and third things you said. I’d like you to repeat the\nsecond.”\n“I told you, she’s still a loyal Dynize.”\n“So …” Michel said, drawing the word out, “you want me to extract a\nspy who isn’t a spy who probably doesn’t want to come with me?”\n“That’s about the size of it.”\n“Why don’t you do it? You’re still here.”\nTaniel snorted in frustration. “Despite our best efforts, we haven’t been\nable to find her. And we have to leave.”\nMichel resisted the urge to ask where Taniel and Ka-poel were heading\nnext. Taniel wouldn’t tell him anyway. Compartmentalization, after all.\n“And the Blackhats?”\n“If they’re useful, use them,” Taniel said with a shrug. “But I have the\nfeeling you’ll be in over your head. Anyone from Fidelis Jes’s inner circle\nmight know more about your betrayal and try to kill you.”\n“I thought all the Gold Roses left Landfall with Lindet.”\n“At least one remained behind, but I don’t know which.”\nA shiver went down Michel’s spine. Every rumor had pointed to the fact\nthat the high-ranking Roses had left with Lindet. He was still using\nBlackhat resources—safe houses, caches, message drops. After the first\nweek he’d decided that no one left in the city knew his true role in betraying\nFidelis Jes, and he had not been cautious enough with those resources.\n“Pit,” he breathed. He took a moment to walk around the ruin, trying to\nshake loose his own sense of dread. Extracting an informant could be tricky\nat the best of times, but finding a foreigner in an occupied city could be\nnext to impossible—especially if she didn’t want to be found. He\nsummoned an inner calm, trying to come at the problem logically.\nIf he was cautious, he could continue to use Blackhat resources. He\ncould moonlight with Hendres and spend his days tracking down this\nDynize informant. Once he found her, he’d have to deal with convincing\nher to leave. Getting her out of the city—as long as his escape routes were\nstill open—would be the easy part.\n“Right,” he said, returning to Taniel. “I’ll do it. What help can you give\nme, and what can you tell me about this woman?”\nTaniel produced an envelope and handed it over. “These are the\naddresses of my personal safe houses. Memorize them and burn the paper."

Memorize them and burn the paper.\nYou’ll find money, gold, weapons, food, and a safe place to sleep. Some of\nthem may have been destroyed or compromised during the riots. I don’t\nknow which ones. There are also a handful of names in there—loyal agents\nof mine who have remained behind. I suggest using them … sparingly, and\nonly in an emergency.”\n“This will help,” Michel said, taking the envelope. “And the woman?”\n“Her name is Mara. I don’t know what she looks like, beyond the fact\nthat she’s Dynize. She’s embedded with the Dynize higher-ups, so reaching\nher might be difficult.”\n“In what way?”\n“She’s attached to the retinue of one of their ministers. I don’t know\nwhich one.”\n“Anything else?”\nTaniel clearly hesitated. “That’s all I know that can help you.”\n“You’re certain?”\n“Yes.”\nMichel knew Taniel well enough to know when he was holding\nsomething back. And that he wouldn’t spill the beans if he didn’t want to.\n“Right. I’ll see what I can do.”\nTaniel stood up, adjusting his gloves and cuffs and straightening his\njacket. “Be cautious, my friend. If the Blackhats find out what you are,\nthey’ll torture and kill you. The Dynize will do worse.”\nMichel scoffed outwardly, while his stomach twisted in a knot. What\ncould possibly be worse than torture and death?\nTaniel offered a hand, and Michel shook it. Without another word, Taniel\npicked his way through the ruins of the hotel and disappeared into the\nstreet. The warning echoed in Michel’s head, raising goose bumps on his\narms. How the pit was he supposed to find this woman, let alone convince\nher to leave Dynize? He might have to resort to a kidnapping, which posed\nits own set of problems.\nThis was going to get him killed, and he knew it. Taniel probably knew\nit, too.\nMichel took his time returning to the safe house. He stopped by one of\nthe few remaining coffeehouses in the city and traded a few coins for a\npitifully small amount of coffee that didn’t even have ice. He drank it\nslowly, considering, trying to come up with a plan to accomplish this\nimpossible task Taniel had just asked of him. He would have to widen his\noperation, recruiting other Blackhats and old contacts—perhaps even risk\ncontacting the remaining Gold Roses that Taniel had warned him about.\nThat would be a last resort, of course, but the option was there.\nMichel finished his coffee. He would have just enough time to reach the\nsafe house before curfew. He’d get a couple hours of rest and then there’d\nbe another night of smuggling families out of the city. He could meditate on\nthe problem during the mission.\nA short time later he walked down the street toward the safe house,\ntipping his hat to a passing Dynize soldier, who told him, in broken Adran,\nthat the curfew was fifteen minutes away.

As he rounded the last corner, he\nfelt his feet slow involuntarily, his senses responding to the long instinct of\na spy rather than any particular stimuli. He came to a stop, eyeballing the\nstreet, looking for something out of place, and then stepped onto a nearby\nstoop to continue his examination.\nIt took him several seconds to see what his instincts had responded to:\nThree Dynize soldiers loitered near the entrance of the tenement containing\nthe safe house. Michel focused on them for a moment, trying to decide if\ntheir presence was a coincidence, when a movement caught the corner of\nhis eye.\nAnother Dynize soldier peeked over the rooftop of the tenement, his\nface barely visible beneath the morion helm. Michel felt his pulse quicken,\nand now that he knew what to look for, he quickly spotted the extra soldier\nat the opposite intersection, and then another lurking in the window of the\napartment two doors down from his safe house. Michel’s mouth went dry,\nhis legs twitching with the desire to run.\nThe safe house was compromised. Hendres was either dead, captured, or\nhad gone underground. Michel ran through a checklist of items he’d left in\nthe safe house to make sure there was nothing he couldn’t abandon, then\ncursed himself for a fool. He should have realized earlier; if Taniel could\nfind him, so could the Dynize.\nCHAPTER 7\nV\nlora stood on the dark slopes of the Hadshaw River Valley with a half-\nempty skin of watered wine dangling from one hand. She hugged herself,\nOlem’s jacket thrown over her shoulders, and stared into the darkness. The\ngarment, smelling of Olem’s sweat, cologne, and favorite tobacco, had a\ncomforting effect that allowed her to think about the last few weeks without\nbecoming overwhelmed.\nTwo days had passed since what the soldiers had taken to calling the\nBattle of Windy River. Two days since the Second Dynize Army had been\nspotted, and two days since a Fatrastan colonel had served her with a\nwarrant of arrest from Lady Chancellor Lindet.\nIt was a stupid gesture, of course. Both Vlora and Lindet knew she\nwasn’t going to accept the warrant and come along quietly. The colonel had\ngiven her the papers and returned to his own army, and Vlora suspected that\nthe paper was simple ceremony—something to tell the Fatrastan soldiers\nthat the mercenary defender of Landfall had done something to lose\nLindet’s favor.\nVlora sipped her wine. She’d not slept well for almost a month. Her eyes\nwere tired, her body sagging. She refused to take powder until she actually\nneeded it, forcing her body to accept the fatigue rather than give in to\naddiction. The last thing she wanted was powder blindness.\n“Are you all right?” a voice asked through the darkness.\nVlora felt Olem’s hand slip into hers and gave it a little squeeze. He\ncame to stand beside her, wearing the same blood-soaked shirt he’d had on\nsince the battle, an unlit, half-smoked cigarette hanging from his lip. He\nwore a bandage around his left forearm to protect the stitches of a deep cut\nhe’d received from a Dynize bayonet.\n“Not really,” she answered."

I’m going to\nmiss her. But I’m a soldier, and I can’t stop and think about all the death or I\nwon’t be able to function tomorrow.”\nVlora shivered, though the air still retained much of the damp heat of the\nday. “I’ve built up plenty of calluses toward death. But some days …” She\nlifted her eyes past the burial, over the fires of the Riflejack camp, and\nacross the river to a sea of flickering lights that spread out in the distance on\nthe other side of the river. The Fatrastan Second Field Army had arrived\nyesterday. It was enormous, over fifty thousand men plus auxiliaries and\ncamp support, and as much as Vlora would like to have taken comfort in\ntheir presence, she was all too aware of that warrant of arrest sitting on the\ntable in her tent.\nOlem searched his pockets, giving up after a few moments. He seemed\nto sense the direction of her gaze. “I’m not entirely pleased,” he said, “that\nthey decided to camp there.”\n“I don’t think we’re meant to be pleased.” For the first time since\ncoming to this damned country, Vlora felt small. Her brigade of\nmercenaries—just over four thousand left after this last battle, and most of\nthose wounded—was barely a footnote in the eighty thousand or more\nsoldiers assembled within shouting distance here on the banks of the\nHadshaw. If she walked up to the ridge, she could see the Dynize camp to\nthe south, watching her and the Fatrastan Army with a caution that their\nbrethren had lacked. She felt as if they were a hammer poised above her,\nand the Fatrastans were the anvil. “I gave the order releasing the Landfall\nGarrison and the Blackhat volunteers over to the Fatrastans.”\n“I heard. Are you sure that’s wise?”\n“If we get sandwiched between these two armies, as I suspect we will,\nfive or six thousand men won’t make a difference. Besides, they’re\nFatrastan. Having them tell the tale of the Battle of Landfall might gain us\nsome goodwill.”\n“We must have made a good impression, because about a thousand of\nthem have asked to sign on.”\n“Even knowing about the arrest warrant?” Vlora asked.

We’ll need to fill out our numbers if we get\nout of this situation.”\n“And if we don’t get out?”\n“Then they’ll learn firsthand about the risks of being a soldier of\nfortune.”\n“I see the calluses have grown back already.”\nVlora gave him a tight smile, though he probably couldn’t see it in the\ndark. “Have our scouts reported anything from either camp?”\n“Nothing of particular note. The Dynize are probing both sides of the\nriver with quite a lot of caution. So far they haven’t made any move to set\nup on our flanks. Seems that the Mad Lancer desecrated a few hundred of\nthose Dynize cuirassiers and left the bodies where they’d be found. I have\nno idea what the Dynize are used to, but that probably turned a few\nstomachs.”\n“Including mine. One of these days I’m going to have to rein Styke in,\nand I’m not looking forward to it.”\n“Neither am I.” Olem turned his head toward her. “Is that my jacket?”\n“Yes.”\nHe reached into the breast pocket. A matched flared to life a moment\nlater, lighting his cigarette and illuminating a pleased smile. “There’s some\ncommunication between us and the Fatrastans, but mostly trade. Our boys\nare making good use of their camp followers while they have them.”\n“And spending all the money Lindet paid us to defend Landfall. Soldiers\nhave no sense of planning for the future, do they?”\n“If they did, they wouldn’t be soldiers. I say let them enjoy themselves\nwhile they can. We might be fighting those Fatrastans soon.”\nVlora’s stomach clenched, and she instinctively glanced south toward\nthe Dynize camp. Hammer and anvil. The arrival of the Fatrastans had only\ndelayed the inevitable. How much more time did she have to plan until the\nenemy decided to strike? How long could this standoff last? Hours? Days?\nWeeks? And when it finally happened, which army would turn on her first?\n“We could turn them against each other,” she murmured.\n“Eh?”\n“The Dynize and Fatrastans. If they didn’t both want my head, they’d\nfocus entirely on each other. They’d barely even notice us.”\n“We could fake your death,” Olem suggested.\n“I’ve never been good at such crass deception,” Vlora said with a\ngrimace. “Besides, it’s too obvious. We need something more subtle.”\n“Distract them and slip away?”\nVlora caught sight of a figure walking up the slope toward them, and she\nthought she recognized the shadowy form. “Perhaps,” she said slowly.

The\nfigure stopped some twenty yards away.\n“General? Colonel?” a voice called.\n“Up here,” Vlora responded.\nOlem squinted into the night. “Is that Gustar? I haven’t seen him since\nthe battle.”\nVlora waited to answer until Gustar had reached them, snapping off a\nshadowy salute. “Ma’am, sir. Major Gustar reporting in.”\n“Gustar,” Vlora explained to Olem, “was one of just a handful of\nofficers who wasn’t wounded the other day.”\n“Pure luck, ma’am,” Gustar interjected.\nShe continued. “Right after the battle, I sent him and a squad of\ndragoons as far north as they could go in twenty-four hours. I’m glad you\nmade it back in one piece, Major. What can you tell us of the road to the\nnorth?”\nGustar removed his hat, dragging a sleeve across his brow. “The short\nversion, or the long version?”\n“The short, for now.”\n“Very good. I can tell you that the Second Field Army came down the\nHadshaw from the Ironhook Mountains via keelboats. They stripped\neverything on their way—supplies, conscripts, local militias. From what we\ncould discover, every town for a hundred miles in that direction pooled\neverything they had into the Second Army.”\n“Leaving them defenseless,” Olem said flatly.\n“Yes, sir.”\n“If only I were the pillaging type,” Vlora murmured. “Go on.”\n“Supposedly there are two more armies on their way down from Thorn\nPoint and Brannon Bay, but with the seas compromised, they could take\nweeks to arrive. No one knows anything about the armies recalled from the\nfrontier to the northwest.”\n“They’ll come down the Tristan River,” Vlora said. “I’m not worried\nabout them. Just what’s north of us.”\n“That’s it,” Gustar said. “If we head northeast, we’re not going to run\ninto anything. There’s no word of the Dynize landing this far north, and\neverything Lindet has between us and New Adopest is contained in that\narmy across the river.”\n“Excellent,” Vlora said. “You and your men help yourself to a double\nration and hit your bunks. You deserve to sleep in tomorrow.”\n“Thank you, ma’am.”\nAnother salute, and the major headed back down the hill.\nVlora waited until he was out of earshot, and said, “Gustar fought in two\nbattles and didn’t blink an eye when I ordered him to ride for forty-eight\nhours straight. The man deserves a promotion.”\n“Agreed,” Olem said. The tip of his cigarette flared. “Were you going to\ntell me about this scouting mission?”\n“I …” Vlora wasn’t entirely sure why she hadn’t told Olem. “It didn’t\nseem important at the time, and we’ve been more than a little busy the last\ntwo days. I sent Gustar on a whim. I didn’t expect the path from here to\nNew Adopest to actually be clear.”"

I didn’t expect the path from here to\nNew Adopest to actually be clear.”\n“So we are going to try and slip away, then beeline it to the coast and\nhead for home?”\n“It’s not elegant,” Vlora admitted. “But yes, that’s my backup plan. It\nmay be our best bet of getting out of Fatrasta alive.”\n“If we can give two major armies the slip.”\n“Exactly.” Vlora scowled at the sea of campfires across the river. “Did\nyou ever tell me who’s in command over there?”\n“A woman named Zine Holm.”\n“Never heard of her.”\n“She’s a Starlish noblewoman. Fought in the Fatrastan War for\nIndependence as a soldier of fortune, and has been commanding armies\nagainst the Palo since.”\n“Competent?”\n“As far as I know, though I think this is the biggest army she’s ever\ncommanded.”\nVlora considered this for several quiet minutes, working through the\nvarious plans in her head and trying to create something coherent enough to\nactually work. “Get me a meeting with her. Also with the Dynize general,\nwhoever the pit that is.”\n“When?”\n“Tomorrow. No, wait. Tonight. As soon as possible. Tell them it’s urgent,\nand we’ll meet at a neutral location.”\nShe could practically hear Olem grimace. “I’ll try, but …”\n“Make it happen.” She tugged on the shoulders of his jacket, feeling a\nreal chill for the first time tonight. “I’m going to try to sleep for a couple\nhours. Wake me up as soon as you’ve set up those meetings.”\nThree hours later, Vlora rode north along the Hadshaw River Highway with\nOlem and a dozen handpicked bodyguards. She half listened to a corporal\ndroning on about supplies and yesterday’s casualties, sniffing a few\ngranules of powder at a time just to stay awake. Across the river, most of\nthe Fatrastan fires were out and the night was all but silent. Occasionally\nher sorcery-enhanced senses spotted sentries along either ridge of the river\nvalley—Fatrastan on the west side, and hers on the east.\nThey reached a crossroads and small keelboat landing, where a party of\nequal size awaited them on the dusty shore. Torches flickered in the light\nbreeze, casting shadows on sunflower-yellow uniforms.\n“Did you hear back from the Dynize?” Vlora asked quietly as they\ndismounted. She kept her eyes on a forty-something-year-old woman in the\ncenter of the waiting group, uniform decked out with medals and the black\nepaulets of a Fatrastan general.\n“I did,” Olem responded. “The Dynize general refuses to see you. He’s\nconvinced it’s a trap, and that you hope to get him alone for an\nassassination.”\n“He’s smarter than his colleague we met a couple days ago,” Vlora said.\n“Which is unfortunate.

        "text": "“Which is unfortunate. I need to size him up. For now I’ll have to satisfy\nmyself with Holm.” She handed her reins to one of her bodyguards and\ncrossed the distance between her and the Fatrastans without preamble.\n“General Holm.” Vlora held out her hand. “Thank you for meeting me\non such short notice.”\n“General Flint.” Holm took the offered hand, shaking it firmly. She was\na stocky woman, broad at the chest with hands as big as a grenadier’s. She\nhad smile lines at the corners of her mouth and friendly eyes that Vlora was\nmore likely to see in a tavern owner. “I’m a big admirer. This is an odd time\nto meet, but I’m a night owl anyway and I figured you had something\nimportant to say.”\nVlora tried to gauge the Fatrastan general, but found herself lacking.\nHolm didn’t seem like the hard-bitten type forged on the frontier, nor the\nsoldier of fortune Olem described. “To be honest, I thought we should meet\nas soon as possible, and this is the first time I’ve been able to pull myself\naway from my duties.”\n“I see.” Holm clicked her tongue as if mildly annoyed. “Well, we’re here\nnow. I’d like to congratulate you on your victory the other day. My scouts\narrived just at the tail end, but I’m told it was rather something—holding\nthe line against a superior force until your cavalry could hit them from\nbehind. Exactly what I’d expect from Lady Flint.”\n“I’m flattered, General. But I either win or die. I prefer to do the\nformer.”\nHolm chuckled. “And that’s exactly what I expect an Adran general to\nsay. Imminently practical.” She clapped her hands together. “Excuse my\ndelight, Lady Flint, but this is just too much. I’ve always wanted to meet\nyou. I wish I could show you the hospitality of my camp.”\n“You’ll forgive my refusal, considering the arrest warrant I was served\nby your colonel the other day. A Fatrastan Army camp seems less than\nwelcoming right now.”\nHolm’s eyes tightened. “Ah, yes. That. I’m … unaware of the\ncircumstances of the warrant, and will freely say I disagree with arresting a\nforeign war hero who’s fighting Fatrastan battles on our behalf.”\n“Does this mean you’re going to ignore it?” Vlora asked hopefully. “You\noutnumber the Dynize, but I understand your army was hastily assembled,\nand I think you could use our experience when you go to retake Landfall.\nYou are going to retake Landfall, aren’t you?”\n“That is my ultimate mission,” Holm said. “Unfortunately, I have every\nintention of arresting you. I’m a great admirer, but Lady Chancellor Lindet\nhas won my loyalty too many times for me to disobey a direct order.”\nVlora wondered if Holm knew about Lindet’s abandonment of Landfall,\nbut bit her tongue. Throwing mud over Lindet’s name was not going to win\nHolm’s friendship. “You’re aware that my men have no intention of\nallowing me to be arrested.”\n“I’d hoped that you’d come along quietly.” Holm paused thoughtfully,"

If you’re\nwilling to accept my hospitality, you will be treated as a guest in my camp\nuntil we are able to meet with Lindet in person. Your wounded will be cared\nfor, your men given safe passage back to Adro—or allowed to fight with the\nFatrastan Foreign Legion if they’d like. You’d have my word that no harm\nwould come to you under my care, and I would be an advocate in whatever\ndispute you have with the Lady Chancellor.”\nOlem leaned forward, whispering, “That’s a better offer than the Dynize\ngave you.”\n“Much,” Vlora murmured. She considered her run-in with Lindet back\nin Landfall. “Unfortunately, I don’t think you can promise my safety,\nGeneral Holm.”\nHolm’s eyebrows rose. “Why is that?”\n“I tried to arrest Lindet for crimes against her own country right before\nthe Dynize arrived. We put our differences aside just long enough to defend\nLandfall.” And then, Vlora added silently, that bitch fled without lifting a\nfinger to help hold the city.\n“Well,” Holm scoffed. “You certainly have a pair of balls worthy of your\nreputation.” She held up a hand as if she needed a moment to digest this\nnew information. “I’m aware that Lindet is far from perfect, but crimes\nagainst her own country?”\nVlora considered telling her about the godstones and Lindet’s ambitions,\nbut decided against it. The story was too far-fetched, and even if Holm\nbelieved it, she might very well think Lindet deserved to get her hands on\nthem. Instead, Vlora offered a small shrug. “I believe that Lindet will have\nme executed the moment she gets a chance. And so I must refuse your\noffer.”\nHolm’s brow furrowed, and Vlora was surprised to hear a note of\ngenuine sadness in her voice. “I’m sorry to hear that, Lady Flint. Am I to\nunderstand that I should consider your army that of an enemy?”\nThe implications of that were immediately clear. Vlora’s men would be\nshot on sight, and Holm would probably begin the morning by crossing the\nriver in a flanking action to encircle Vlora’s army—at which point she\ncould either force a fight, or simply wait for Vlora’s men to run out of\nrations and surrender.\nThe question of the Dynize Army made the entire situation much\nmurkier.\n“Tell me,” Vlora said, “did you bring Privileged?”\nHolm’s reply was frosty. “That is not information I will tell you if we are\nenemies.”\n“Our scouts say they have three Privileged,” Olem cut in.\nHolm opened her mouth, a scowl on her face, but Vlora simply held up\nher hand. “I’m not threatening you—and I have no intention of murdering\nyour Privileged unless we engage in combat. I just wanted to warn you that\nthe Dynize do not have either bone-eyes or Privileged with them. But they\nare bloody disciplined, and breaking them will take more than\noverwhelming force.”"

But they\nare bloody disciplined, and breaking them will take more than\noverwhelming force.”\n“Why are you telling me this?”\n“Because whatever happens to me, you’re going to fight those Dynize\nsometime in the next few days. And I’d rather you win than them. Frankly, I\nthink the battle will be more in their favor than you expect.”\nHolm chewed on this information, a worried frown on her face, eyeing\nVlora. “I’ll take this information under advisement.”\n“I—” Vlora was cut off by the sound of hooves galloping toward them\nfrom the direction of her camp. “Excuse me,” she told Holm, striding back\ntoward her bodyguard. She found one of her messengers waiting with them,\nhis chest heaving from a hard ride. “Is it the Dynize?” Vlora demanded. “A\nnight attack?”\n“No, ma’am,” the messenger said in a hushed tone. “You told me to let\nyou know the moment Taniel and Ka-poel arrived.” He gestured into the\ndarkness behind him, and Vlora was able to make out two figures on\nhorseback hanging back in the darkness. She could suddenly sense Taniel’s\npowder magic, as if it had appeared from nothing—as if he were letting her\nknow about his presence.\nVlora looked at Olem. “They’re here.”\n“Should we return to camp?” Olem asked.\n“No,” she said, jerking her head toward the road. “They’re here.”\n“Oh.”\nVlora returned to Holm. “General, I’m afraid I have to cut this meeting\nshort. Will you allow me to reconsider your offer?”\n“Has something changed?” Holm asked, peering over Vlora’s shoulder\ntoward the messenger.\n“Maybe.”\n“I can give you until tomorrow afternoon. Then I will consider the\nRiflejacks an enemy army.”\n“Thank you.” Vlora turned to leave, then paused. “Am I to be assured\nthe Landfall refugees have your protection?”\n“We’ve already begun to pass out what supplies we can spare. I will take\ncare of them the best I can—and I will not let the Dynize have them.”\n“Again, thank you,” Vlora said. “I will answer you tomorrow.” She left\nthe general at the keelboat landing and headed back to her bodyguard to\nfetch her horse. She and Olem rode ahead, toward the two figures waiting in\nthe darkness.\nShe could see that both Taniel and Ka-poel were tired. Their horses were\nhaggard, their clothes covered with the dust of the road. They both wore\ngreatcoats over frontier buckskins, with rifles, swords, and pistols strapped\nto their saddles. They looked like a pair of bounty hunters chasing an\noutlaw.\n“Good evening,” Olem said, tipping his hat.\n“Morning, more like it,” Taniel responded. “Good to see you again,\nOlem. Glad you’ve healed up since Landfall.” Ka-poel waved. “We would\nhave been here yesterday,” Taniel explained, “but the Dynize have the roads\nsouth of their army buttoned up pretty tight.”\n“What news?” Vlora asked."

We know where the other two godstones are.”\nCHAPTER 8\nB\nen, wake up.”\nStyke stared at the stars, his saddle beneath his head as a pillow while he\nstretched out on a bedroll tossed sloppily on the damp grass to keep him\ndry. He waited to answer until a boot nudged his ribs. “I’m awake.”\nIbana leaned over him, peering into his eyes, and gave him a gentle slap\non one cheek. “Then answer when I call.”\n“It’s the middle of the night,” Styke replied. He’d never had a problem\nsleeping until the labor camps. The pain of his old wounds, the uncertainty\nhe felt toward the guards and the other inmates; he’d gained the ability to\ntake catnaps but still had difficulty with real, deep sleep. Since he got out,\nhis rest had been inconsistent—some nights as easy as lying down, while\nother nights sleep was elusive until late in the morning. This night was one\nof the latter.\n“I damn well know it’s the middle of the night. But there’s something\nyou should see.”\n“Is it important?”\n“It is for you.”\nReluctantly, Styke found his boots and climbed to his feet, glaring at\nIbana through the darkness. “I was enjoying the quiet.”\n“It’s not going to be quiet much longer. Rumor has it Flint has a plan up\nher sleeve, and it includes us making a move before sunup.”\n“Is that why you woke me up?” Styke made a fist, then stretched out his\nfingers, repeating the motion to loosen the muscles.\n“No. Something else.”\n“Pit.” He thought about ignoring her and throwing himself back to the\nground in a futile effort to get a few more hours of sleep. If this was really\nimportant, Ibana would have woken up everyone. “Okay, fine. What do you\nwant to show me?”\nIbana led him through the lancer camp and out through their eastern\npickets. They didn’t exchange another word until they were well beyond\nearshot of the guards; then she said, “How is your hand?”\n“Fine.” Styke, midstretch, buried his left hand in his pocket. “Why?\nCeline telling you stories?”\n“She’s worried about you.”\n“Yeah? Well, I’m more worried about you telling a little girl that I need\nto stop feeling sorry for myself.”\nIbana paused briefly before continuing their walk. “And I need to teach\nher how to keep secrets.”\n“Not from me, you don’t.”\n“Every girl keeps secrets from her dad,” Ibana said with a note of\nbemusement. “Just like every boy keeps them from his mom.”\nDad. What an odd notion. Styke had no way of knowing if he had a few\nbastards scattered around Fatrasta, but he’d certainly never thought of\nhimself as a father.

        "text": "himself as a father. But with Celine, it felt right. “I wouldn’t know.”\nAnother pause. “Sorry.”\nStyke rolled his eyes. Thirty years or more since his father murdered his\nmother. It was underhanded to play that card, but he was tired and irritable\nand Ibana hadn’t yet told him why she was dragging him all the way out\nhere. “It’s fine. What’s going on here, anyway? You didn’t wake me up to\nask after my health.”\n“No,” Ibana said, “I didn’t.” She gestured ahead of them, and Styke\nlooked up to see the distant outline of a small farmhouse with a light\nflickering in the single window. He scowled, curious, but allowed Ibana to\nlead him onward until they were almost to the house. It was an old\nfarmsteaders’ plot, a one-room home with rotting timber walls and a low\nsod roof.\n“Who lives here?” Styke asked.\n“No idea. We found it empty, but it seemed apt for our needs.”\n“What needs were …?” Styke trailed off as Ibana opened the door and\nthey both stepped inside. Everything of value had been cleared out of the\nhouse, leaving bare walls and a dirt floor. A single lantern hung from the\nrafters and illuminated three men. Styke recognized two of them: Markus\nand Zac were a pair of Brudanian brothers in their midthirties, ugly as sin\nand dressed in rags that helped them blend in when they were out scouting.\nThe brothers were old Mad Lancers, two of the original group that had\nhelped Styke terrorize the Kez Army all those years ago.\nThe third figure was a bigger man, kneeling between the brothers with a\nburlap sack over his head and hands bound behind his back.\n“Afternoon, Colonel!” Markus said cheerily, snapping a salute.\n“It’s the middle of the night, you twit,” Zac told him.\n“Don’t make no difference. Night, afternoon, all just a construct of the\nmodern man.”\n“Oh, don’t start this shit again.”\n“It’s true! If it weren’t for man, the sun in the sky wouldn’t care what we\ncalled each particular time of day. Why, I bet—”\nStyke cleared his throat and Markus’s mouth shut. Styke glanced at\nIbana, who’d taken up a spot by the window and now stood watching the\nsmall group impassively. “What’s all this?” Styke asked her.\nIbana nodded at the two brothers. They exchanged a glance, and Zac\nspoke up. “It’s a little bit of a story, Colonel, sir, if you don’t mind me\ntelling it.”\n“Make it short,” Styke said, though his curiosity was piqued. He\nsquinted at the kneeling man, wondering who was hidden beneath that\nburlap. He had the distinct impression he knew the prisoner.\n“You remember the day they took you to the firing squad?”\nMarkus punched his brother in the shoulder. He hissed, “Of course he\nremembers, fool. Don’t be insensitive!”\n“Right, well …” Zac cleared his throat. “Markie and I, we’ve spent a lot\nof time thinking about that day.”\n“Me too,” Styke said slowly."

They put you to the firing squad before we could organize\nourselves and afterward they didn’t even leave us a body. We had a funeral\nfor you the next day.”\n“That’s touching,” Styke interrupted, “but I don’t know what you’re\ngetting at.”\n“He said short, you prick,” Markus whispered. He cleared his throat and\ntook up where his brother left off. “What he’s getting at is this, sir: There\nwere four of us missing from the funeral.”\nStyke felt his eyes narrow and now he couldn’t take his gaze from the\nkneeling form. He was beginning to have his suspicions about who was\nunder that burlap bag, and about where this story was going. It was not a\ndirection he wanted to follow.\n“Thing is, sir, we gave up our weapons because four of us convinced the\nrest that the Blackhats were going to give them right back. And those four\nthat made that argument … well, they weren’t at your funeral. So a couple\nyears ago, me and Zac decided to track them down. Did some asking, dug\naround a little bit in back channels. All four of them wound up with a\nwindfall from Lindet’s regime right after the war. They got paid off for\nsomething, sir.”\n“You’re saying they betrayed me?” Styke asked bluntly. He resisted the\nidea—he didn’t want to consider that any of his lancers would turn on him\n—but slowly, it began to make sense. His memories of the day were fuzzy\nat best, but he remembered an argument among the lancers before they were\ndisarmed. There was no way Fidelis Jes could have managed that without\ninside help.\n“They betrayed us,” Ibana said.\nThe brothers looked at Ibana for a long few moments before Markus\nducked his head toward Styke. “Three of them weren’t hard to track down.\nWe’ve been keeping an eye on them since. But this one”—he nudged the\nkneeling figure with one boot—“he hasn’t been seen since. We found him\nwith the refugees yesterday.”\nStyke took a step toward the kneeling man and jerked the sack off his\nhead, discarding it in the corner. The face that blinked up at him was\nfamiliar, if aged a decade. He was in his forties, roughly the same age as\nStyke, and had graying brown hair and a wispy beard. He had a thick neck\nand muscular shoulders, which had made him a fantastic lancer, and he\nblinked up at Styke’s face impassively. His left eye was swollen nearly shut\nby a recent shiner, and Styke wondered which of the brothers had given it to\nhim.\n“Sergeant Agoston.”\nStyke remembered Agoston as an implacable figure, unruffled by burned\nvillages and slaughtered enemies. He’d been a sword-for-hire before the\nwar and joined up with the lancers for the spoils, always ready to go\nthrough the pockets of the dead after a battlefield.

        "text": "through the pockets of the dead after a battlefield. Styke had considered\nAgoston a friend—not close enough for secrets, but a man he’d share a beer\nwith at the end of the day.\nAgoston glanced at Ibana, more irritated than afraid, and gave a deep\nsigh. “Styke,” he replied. “I’m not a sergeant anymore. Haven’t been since\nthe war.”\n“Yeah? And what have you been up to since the war?”\n“A little bit of this, a little of that.”\nAgoston’s nonchalance suddenly touched something within Styke, and\nhe could feel a rage building deep in his stomach. “And this story the\nbrothers are telling me? What do you make of that?”\n“A bunch of rubbish.”\nIbana snorted. “He’s lying.”\n“I am not,” Agoston protested.\n“I played cards with you for eighteen months, asshole. You look down\nand to your left when you bluff.”\n“I do not …” Agoston looked down and to his left, then grimaced. He\nsniffed, his mouth forming into a hard line.\nWhen it became clear he would say no more, Styke began to pace. The\nanger was building, and he forced his voice to remain neutral, matching\nAgoston’s calm demeanor. “You betrayed the lancers, Agoston. You got me\nsent to the firing squad. Did you know what Fidelis Jes was planning?”\nThere was a long, empty pause, and Styke added, “Don’t pull this silent\nbullshit on me. You can either answer the question or we can take a few\nminutes and bury you alive beneath this hovel.”\nAgoston glanced around the room once more, and Styke could see the\ncalculations going through his head: his chances of escaping, or putting up a\ngood fight, or at least making them finish him off quickly. The corner of his\nlip curled, and Styke remembered something about his own experience\nplaying cards with Agoston: He always got surly when he was losing. “Two\nmillion krana.”\nStyke raised his eyebrows. “Pit. You’re joking, right?”\n“Fidelis Jes really wanted you dead.”\n“I knew that. But two million?” Styke scoffed. “I would have damned\nwell just retired if he’d come to me first.”\n“No you wouldn’t,” Agoston spat. “You like killing too much.”\n“Maybe.” Styke acted careless, but on the inside he continued to boil.\nAgoston had been a comrade-in-arms, even a friend. To sell Styke out, even\nfor so much money … He felt his facade crack and turned away for a\nmoment so that Agoston couldn’t see the emotions playing out across his\nface. “Why didn’t you just put a knife between my ribs yourself?”\n“Because I’m not stupid. These assholes would have hunted me down no\nmatter where I went. There’s not enough money to knife Ben Styke.”\nStyke almost gave Agoston credit for that underlying assumption that he\ncould have finished the job. Almost. “And that money? Did you spend it\nwell?”\n“Bought a townhouse in Upper Landfall. Changed my name. Kept my\nhead down. Spent the last decade whoring and gambling in places so\nexpensive I was never likely to see a lancer again.” Agoston gave him a"

        "text": "head down. Spent the last decade whoring and gambling in places so\nexpensive I was never likely to see a lancer again.” Agoston gave him a\nshallow smile. “So, yeah, I spent it well.”\nStyke looked at his hand and flexed his fingers. Ten years in the labor\ncamp, when only a couple miles away one of the people who put him there\nlived a life of luxury and excess. He’d known about Fidelis Jes, of course,\nand his hatred was one of the things that kept him alive. But Jes had always\nbeen an enemy. Agoston … not so much. Styke remained looking at the\nwall, facing away from Agoston. “Cut his bonds,” he said.\nIbana started. “What?”\n“You heard me.”\nHesitantly, Ibana nodded to the brothers.\n“You sure, sir?” Markus asked.\nStyke nodded, not trusting himself to speak. He flexed his fingers,\nfeeling that twinge, churning that rage. “Zac, do you have a pistol on you?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Is it loaded?”\n“Yes.”\n“Give it to Agoston.”\n“Sir?”\n“Now!” Styke turned around and glared at Zac, who licked his lips and\nglanced warily at Ibana. Styke held a hand toward her. “Don’t say a damned\nword. Zac, give him your pistol.”\nZac drew his pistol and handed it to Agoston as he climbed to his feet.\nAgoston brushed himself off and took the pistol, staring at Styke intently.\n“What’s this?” His tone said that he sensed a trap, but he didn’t know where\nit was.\nStyke took a step toward him and spread his hands. “You wanted me\ndead. You were paid to help put me in a grave. It didn’t work, so here’s your\nshot to earn that two million. Put a bullet in my head.”\nWithout hesitation, Agoston lifted the pistol and took a half step\nforward, pressing the barrel against Styke’s forehead. He pulled the trigger,\nand Styke heard the click-and-snap of the flintlock.\nNothing happened.\n“You think you’re hot shit, Agoston,” Styke said, finally letting his fury\nunfurl. “But you never paid attention. Zac still carries the same shitty, leaky\npowder horn he has for fifteen years. Powder gets wet and his pistol\nmisfires two times out of three.”\nAs Styke finished the sentence, a look of panic spread across Agoston’s\nface. He backpedaled and tried to flip the pistol around to use it as a\nweapon, but Styke was on him before he could take a second step. Styke\ndrew his boz knife, dragged the blade along Agoston’s sternum, and\nrammed it into the soft spot beneath his jaw until the crosspiece touched\nskin and the tip jutted from the top of his skull. Agoston’s eyes bugged, a\nrasping came from his mouth, and his body convulsed. Styke allowed his\nmomentum to carry them against the far wall of the hovel and slammed\nAgoston’s body against the rotted timbers. The whole house shook.\nHis hands soaked with warm blood, Styke stared into Agoston’s dead\neyes. “Who else betrayed me?” he asked the brothers quietly."

The whole house shook.\nHis hands soaked with warm blood, Styke stared into Agoston’s dead\neyes. “Who else betrayed me?” he asked the brothers quietly.\n“Bad Tenny Wiles, Valyaine, and Dvory,” Markus answered.\n“Where are they?”\n“Tenny Wiles owns a plantation about a hundred miles west of here;\nValyaine is a boxer in Belltower; and Dvory is a general in the Fatrastan\nArmy.”\nStyke let Agoston’s body fall. “Toss him in the rubbish heap out back.\nHe doesn’t deserve a real burial.” He took a deep breath and clapped\nMarkus, then Zac on the shoulder, leaving a bloody handprint on each.\n“Thank you. I needed that. Whatever happens these next few months, I’m\ngoing to find the rest of those assholes and kill them.” He looked at Ibana.\n“Let’s go find out what Flint is up to.”\nCHAPTER 9\nV\nlora drank cold coffee at the table in the middle of her tent. She stared\nabsently at the maps laid out in front of her and noticed that her hand was\ntrembling. Olem sat on the corner of her cot, fiddling with the metal tin he\nkept his matches in. His face mirrored her expression: absent, lost—shell-\nshocked. He licked his lips, opened his mouth as if to speak, but closed it\nagain. She hadn’t seen him this out of sorts since the Adran-Kez War. Taniel\nand Ka-poel were standing just outside their tent, waiting for Vlora’s\ndecision on the news they’d brought from Landfall.\n“Taniel wants us to go find these other two godstones,” Vlora said. “Is it\nour responsibility?”\nOlem looked up, blinking away his own thoughts.\nVlora continued before he could reply. “We’re Adrans. We have no\nhorse in this race. The Fatrastans, Dynize, and Palo are going to spend the\nnext few months—maybe even years—killing each other over these things.\nWhy should we get involved?” She slapped her palm on the table, almost\nspilling her coffee, feeling a sudden swell of anger. “We’re in this damned\nsituation because I couldn’t just keep my head down and do a job. I tried to\narrest Lindet over these stupid things, and I managed to lose our allies on\nthis continent in the process.”\nOlem clicked his match tin against the wooden frame of her cot, his\nexpression conflicted. “We’ve seen what gods can do to a country,” he said.\n“This isn’t our country. We’re mercenaries, and after a year in the\nswamps and two major battles the men are almost spent. I’m not going to\nappeal to their patriotism, because this isn’t an Adran matter.”\n“I agree with that.”\n“Then answer me this: Is this our responsibility?”\n“No,” Olem said. He tilted his head, as if pained, and said, “And …\nyes.”\n“Explain.”\n“Less responsibility,” Olem said, “and more necessity. Back in Landfall\nyou said that the world doesn’t need any more gods, and I think you’re still\nright about that. These consequences that you and I understand—I think it"

These consequences that you and I understand—I think it\nmakes us responsible, even if our men are not. This world is not as large as\nit once was. You’re still a member of the Adran Cabal, and we’re both still\nAdran generals. We can either deal with a new god once this continent has\nfinished warring over the stones, or we can try to prevent one from being\nborn in the first place.”\n“So you’d argue that it is an Adran matter?”\n“I’d argue that it will be. Unfortunately, we aren’t accompanied by the\nAdran Army. We’re accompanied by mercenaries.”\n“So what do we do? Send the men home and you and I offer to join\nwhatever it is Taniel is stirring up?”\n“It’s an option,” Olem said. “But these things will probably be much\neasier with an army at our back, even if it’s a little mauled right now.”\nVlora finished off her coffee, spitting the dregs out on the ground and\nreturning her gaze to the map on her table. Taniel had left two pins in the\nmap. One of them was located on the edge of the Ironhook Mountains, not\nall that far from here. The other was located on the west coast of Fatrasta.\nVlora tapped her finger on the tip of each pin, and then on New Adopest—\nthe closest large port not in the hands of the Dynize, and the best chance she\nhad of getting an army back to Adro.\n“Taniel!” she shouted.\nA moment passed before the tent flap was thrown back. Taniel and Ka-\npoel entered. Ka-poel immediately rounded the table to examine the map in\nsilence, while Taniel looked from Vlora to Olem with an irritating air of\nexpectation.\nVlora said, “You told me once that you still have Tamas’s foreign wealth\nat your command.”\n“I do,” Taniel said, pulling back somewhat. This was not the question he\nhad expected.\n“Good. Because Olem and I are in. This is a matter for the Adran Army\nand the Adran Cabal, and we’re the only representatives on the continent.\nHowever, this isn’t the responsibility of my men.” She paused for a beat.\n“But I’m not going to do this without an army. You’re going to hire the\nRiflejacks. I expect every soldier out there who survives, and all the\nwidows and widowers of the ones who don’t, to leave this conflict as\nwealthy people. Understand?”\nTaniel cocked an eyebrow. Across the table, Ka-poel grinned and\nnodded. Done.\n“I offered to hire you before,” Taniel said.\n“That was before I grasped the stakes. Besides, I’m serious when I say\n‘wealthy.’ Our prices went up significantly since we last spoke.”\nKa-poel shrugged and twirled her finger, as if saying the conversation\nwas already finished and she was ready to move on. “All right,” Taniel said.\n“We’ll hammer out details on the road.”\n“One other thing,” Vlora added. “You will give us objectives, but I will\ndecide how they’re carried out. You’re not going to dictate what happens to\nthe godstones once we find them. Understand?”"

You’re not going to dictate what happens to\nthe godstones once we find them. Understand?”\n“I see.” Taniel’s eyes narrowed, and Vlora could tell he was rethinking\nthe idea.\nShe leaned on the table, looking him in the eye. “I intend to destroy\nthose things. That is my goal—no, that is the goal of the Adran Republic\nCabal. No new gods.”\n“You’re making a lot of demands for a mercenary.”\n“You didn’t hear what I just said. I have a mercenary army, but I\nrepresent Adro in this matter. And you have a look on your face that seems\nawfully uncertain for someone hoping for my help. I’m ready to go home\nright now, Taniel. Take it or leave it.”\nTaniel looked to Ka-poel, and the two shared a long, silent gaze.\n“Taken,” Taniel said with finality.\nVlora swallowed, her throat suddenly dry. She wished she had a few\ndays to sleep on the decision. She wished she had a bigger, healthier army.\nAnd she wished she didn’t feel like events were about to spiral out of her\ncontrol.\n“What are you going to do about these armies we’re pinned between?”\nTaniel asked.\n“Olem,” Vlora said, “when is dawn?”\n“Two hours or so.”\n“And what will the weather be like?”\n“We’ve had a chilly night. Same as last night, and yesterday morning we\nhad a thick fog until ten. I don’t see things being different today.”\nVlora took the pins out of her maps and began to roll them up carefully.\n“Get everyone moving. I want us on track to be gone within two hours.”\n“And you think the Fatrastans and Dynize are just going to let you\nleave?” Taniel asked flatly. “I understand both are looking for your head.”\n“Fog will give us a head start,” Vlora said. “The rest … well, I have an\nidea. Olem, I want to see Styke, Gustar, and my senior officer corps.\nVallencian, too. I think he crossed the river, so you’ll have to do that\nquietly. Now, get out of here so I can write some letters.”\nDawn was almost upon them, and Vlora stood by her horse and watched as\nthe rest of her camp vanished before her eyes. Soldiers finished packing\ntheir kit, officers kept things orderly, and quartermasters examined the\nwagons of supplies they’d managed to bring over from the Fatrastan camp\nfollowers in the darkness.\nThe fog Olem had predicted was thinner than she would have liked. It\nwould mask their movements, but for only so long—within hours both the\nDynize and Fatrastans would know that she’d given them the slip. The\nquestion Vlora needed answered most of all was whether they would turn\ntheir focus on one another, or whether either general was dogmatic enough\nto come for her.\nA familiar figure appeared through the gloom, torch held high over his\nhead, the scrap of bearskin still clinging to his shoulders.

        "text": "head, the scrap of bearskin still clinging to his shoulders. Vallencian\nHabbabberden, known more widely as the Ice Baron, was nothing short of a\nwalking miracle. He’d saved the Battle of Landfall by riding his merchant\nships out on the tide to crash into and sow chaos among the Dynize fleet.\nSomehow, he’d managed to swim back to shore against the currents and\nrecover from half drowning, only to be on his feet again to help with the\nevacuation of the city. He’d spent every moment since then as a whirlwind\nthrough the refugee camp, redistributing supplies, breaking up fights,\ntending to the sick, and organizing former small-time politicians into a\ngenuine leadership for the refugees.\nVallencian had grown gaunt since they’d first met in Landfall a couple\nof months ago. He’d lost weight, his hair had grayed at the edges and\nremained uncombed, and his face seemed fixed by a frustrated scowl.\n“You’re leaving,” he said brusquely.\n“We are.”\n“Does General Holm know? I’ve been a guest of hers for the last day\nand she is very intent on presenting you to Lindet.”\nVlora produced a letter she had written less than an hour ago and offered\nit to Vallencian. “She will when you give her this letter.”\nVallencian stared down his nose at the paper and did not reach for it.\nAfter a long moment’s consideration, he said in a low voice, “Don’t leave\nme with them.”\n“Excuse me?” Vlora was shocked to hear genuine dismay in his tone.\n“Are they mistreating you?”\n“Quite the opposite. Holm has assigned me an entourage. I think she’s\nhaving me watched. I had to pretend I needed a shit just to sneak out of my\ntent when your summons came. They’re making me sleep in a real bed. And\nthese damned refugees are trying to elect me as mayor of this moving city\nwe have gathered.”\nDespite her frayed nerves, Vlora had to stifle a smile. “I can’t think of\nanyone better suited.”\n“I could name a dozen in a single breath. Probably a hundred if you give\nme the chance to think.” Vallencian paced, gesturing as he spoke. “These\nrefugees don’t need a mayor, and Holm has no intention of allowing it.\nThey’ll be split up and sent to whatever towns and cities can take them, as\nquickly as can be managed. I have no interest in being the general’s guest\nand I have no interest in being bullied into a position of leadership.”\n“I thought you had taken well to helping …”\nVallencian stopped his pacing long enough to shake a thick finger\nbeneath her nose. “Helping!” he exclaimed. “Not leading. I’m a reluctant\nbusinessman at best. I will not be a politician.”\n“You’re very good with people,” Vlora ventured. “They could use your\nhelp, at least until this refugee camp has been dissolved.”\n“Absolutely not. I will come with you, Lady Flint.”\nVlora resisted the urge to point out he hadn’t been invited. “You won’t\nstay with them? At least for a few weeks?”\n“No.”\n“Even if I request it personally?”\nVallencian came to a stop and turned toward her cautiously. “Why"

At least for a few weeks?”\n“No.”\n“Even if I request it personally?”\nVallencian came to a stop and turned toward her cautiously. “Why\nwould you want me to stay with them? Are you trying to get rid of me?”\nVlora could think of nothing more pleasurable or frustrating than the\nidea of having Vallencian along on Taniel’s mission. “I swear I am not. I\nknow that you have done much for me—you damned well ended the Battle\nof Landfall—but I need a personal favor.”\n“I sacrificed my ships for Fatrasta,” Vallencian declared. “I would not\nhumble myself to claim a favor for such an act. In fact, I intend on charging\nLindet for those ships, and the revenue I’ve lost from their destruction.”\n“Reluctant businessman indeed,” Vlora murmured. “Vallencian, I have\nabout seven hundred men who are too wounded to march. I have discharged\nthem from the company so they won’t be treated as enemy combatants, but\nI need someone to care for them—to advocate for them—and if need be, to\nprotect them.”\nVallencian drew himself up, chest puffing out. “And you would trust me\nwith such a task?”\n“If it’s not too …”\n“Too much? It would be an honor!”\nVlora saw the movement too late. “Vallencian, don’t … hug me.” She\nfound herself crushed against his broad chest, then thrust back at arm’s\nlength like a father examining his daughter on her wedding day. His face\nwas red, his lips pressed in a tight line.\n“Please don’t cry,” Vlora said.\n“I won’t.” Vallencian’s voice cracked, and he dabbed at the corners of\nhis eyes with his bearskin. Vlora tried to reconcile the avenging angel\npiloting burning ships into the enemy fleet with the man standing before her\non the edge of tears. “I won’t,” he said with more confidence. “But I will\nhave you know that I accept this task, and I will take it very seriously. Your\nwounded soldiers will not be neglected or used as bargaining chips or in\nany way mistreated while I still live.”\nVlora wondered if there was a more genuine man in the entire world,\nand had no doubt that he would do as promised. “Some will die from their\nwounds,” she said quietly. “Some will be cripples for life. Hopefully more\nwill recover fully. You can send them on to New Adopest to take a ship\nhome where they can claim their pension. If they are hale, they can come\nfind me.”\n“You’re not going back to Adro?” Vallencian’s eyes narrowed curiously.\n“It’s best I not tell you where we’re headed.”\n“I understand.” Vallencian reached out and plucked the letter from\nVlora’s fingers. “I will deliver this to Holm immediately.”\nVlora held up a hand. “If you would wait two hours, actually.”\n“Exactly?” Vallencian produced a pocket watch. “It will be done. Good-\nbye, Lady Flint. May we meet again under more favorable circumstances.”\nHe gave a flourishing bow and backed away, then turned and disappeared\ninto the fog.\nVlora watched him go, then turned to find Ben Styke waiting for her."

You wanted to see me, Flint?”\n“I expect you figured out we’re leaving.”\n“I gathered. My lancers are ready to ride, but no one knows where to.”\nVlora stood on her toes, peering into the dark fog for some sign of\nOlem. She spotted him nearby, his jacket discarded while he and a trio of\nsoldiers replaced a wagon wheel. “Where is Taniel?” she called to him.\n“One, two …” Olem grunted as he helped lift the wagon, and replied in\na strained voice and the jerk of his head. “Last I saw, he was getting a new\nhorse.”\n“Come with me,” Vlora told Styke. They walked over to a corral of\ncaptured Dynize horses, and found Taniel and Ka-poel going through the\nherd with a critical eye. She beckoned them over. While she waited, she\nturned to Styke. “You remember the godstone, correct?”\n“The thing we fought the Dynize for south of Landfall?” He rubbed his\nnose vigorously. “That thing reeked of old sorcery. I didn’t like it.”\n“I’ll give you the short version,” Vlora said. “That godstone is an artifact\nof immense sorcerous power. It is one of three that in conjunction can be\nused to create a new god. Taniel has hired us to find, secure, and hopefully\ndestroy the other two godstones before either Lindet or the Dynize can find\nand use them.”\nStyke stuck a tongue into his cheek. “Huh.”\n“I don’t really care if you believe me. You and your lancers will be paid\nthe same as my own Adrans—and Taniel is going to bleed gold for this.”\n“I’ve heard weirder things,” Styke grunted.\n“Are you in?”\n“Perhaps. Where is our objective?”\n“The western coast of Fatrasta, at the end of the Hammer.”\nStyke lifted his eyes to the sky, his lips moving silently, as if he were\nexamining a map in his head. A small, strange smile touched the corners of\nhis mouth. “The money sounds good, and keeping Lindet away from her\nprize will delight the pit out of my lancers. So yes, I’m in.” Taniel and Ka-\npoel joined them, and Styke gave each a nod. He eyed Ka-poel for several\nseconds before turning his attention back to Vlora.\n“Excellent,” Vlora said. She had expected more questions, defiance, or\n… she didn’t really know. Styke’s legend never included him being easy to\nwork with, so his quick answer was a relief. “Taniel and Ka-poel managed\nto dig through the archives Lindet was forced to abandon in Landfall.”\n“Her personal archives,” Taniel interjected."

One of them is\nlocated in the Ironhook Mountains near a gold-mining town called Yellow\nCreek. I’m taking my army up to try and find it.”\n“And you want the lancers to find the other one?”\n“Our information on the other one is more vague,” Taniel spoke up. “We\nknow it’s out on the Hammer, probably in the vicinity of Starlight. We need\nsomeone mobile to go looking for it.”\nStyke looked from Taniel, to Ka-poel, to Vlora. Slowly, he took off his\nbig ring and breathed on it, polishing the skull on the breast of his faded\ncavalry jacket. “Have the Dynize landed on the west coast?”\n“That’s what Taniel’s intelligence says,” Vlora said. “Though not in as\nbig numbers as at Landfall.” She watched Styke’s face for some hint of\nhesitation. She needed to go after both stones, but splitting her infantry was\nthe worst possible scenario.\n“And Lindet will no doubt have troops in the area,” Styke added.\n“Without a doubt,” Vlora said. “I intend on putting Major Gustar and the\nremnants of his cuirassiers and dragoons under your command. You’ll be\nriding with close to a thousand seasoned cavalry.”\nStyke replaced his ring and opened and closed his hand, eyes on a thin\nwhite scar over the tendons of his wrist. “Fewer might be better in this\nsituation,” he said. “But Gustar knows what he’s doing. I’ll take them.” He\nnodded to himself, and Vlora let out a soft sigh of relief. Losing her cavalry\nwould be rough, but Styke could use them more fully on the coast than she\ncould up in the mountains. Styke opened his mouth, and Vlora tensed in the\nface of protestations. He said, “I can smell sorcery. I have a few other\nKnacked in my company. But if Lindet’s Privileged haven’t found it yet,\nhow do you expect a bunch of lancers to do it?”\nVlora glanced at Taniel, who snorted out a laugh. “You remember that\nfavor you owe me, Colonel?” Taniel asked.\n“I do,” Styke said slowly.\nKa-poel grinned, and Taniel put his arm around her waist. “Well, I’m\ncalling it in. You’re not going to find the godstone. She is, and you’re going\nto make sure she survives, even if it costs the lives of you and every one of\nyour men.”\nVlora dismissed Styke and left Ka-poel and Taniel to pick out their horses\nfor the journey ahead, hoping she’d made the right decision in giving Styke"

Something nagged at the back of her mind, something that she\ncouldn’t quite put her finger on. She put it aside and found Olem just as the\nfirst company of Riflejack infantry began their march out of camp.\n“Everything set with Styke?” Olem asked.\n“He’s in,” Vlora said. “He’ll take Ka-poel and go cause havoc in the\nwest. Taniel will come with us to find and secure the other godstone.”\n“Does Styke know he’s a distraction?”\nVlora grimaced. “ ‘Distraction’ is a harsh word. He has his orders, and\nhe has Ka-poel. I daresay he has a better chance of finding and destroying\nhis godstone than we do ours.”\n“But sending him out across Fatrasta will draw attention away from us.”\n“Styke is not a subtle man. I think he’s well aware of that and the\ndangers it entails. What’s done is done. Oh, I gave Vallencian a letter for\nHolm.” Vlora dug into her pocket and produced a second letter, handing it\nto Olem. “Wait an hour, then send a runner to the Dynize camp.”\nOlem took the letter and held it with both hands, as if weighing it.\n“What do they say?”\n“The first letter,” Vlora said, watching the last vestiges of the camp\ndisappear as soldiers fell into marching formation, “tells General Holm that\nI’m leaving. It also tells her that the Dynize general has orders to take my\nhead and will march after me. She can either give chase, or she can use the\nopportunity to press on toward Landfall.”\n“And this letter?” Olem hefted the other note.\n“It tells the Dynize general that I’m leaving, and that the Fatrastans also\nwant my head and will give chase and that he can deal with whichever he\ndeems to be the largest threat.”\nOlem stared curiously at the letter. “So you told them both the truth,\nmore or less.”\n“A half-truth, yes. The difference is that I expect Holm to believe me. I\ndon’t expect the Dynize to believe me. The Dynize will shore up their\ndefenses, maybe even send a couple brigades after us, while Holm—being a\ncompetent general—will not want an enemy force behind her. She’ll attack\nthe Dynize as soon as possible.”\n“We should have done this two days ago.”\n“I didn’t know the character of the enemy generals then,” Vlora said.\n“Find me my horse and let’s get going. I hope this works.”\nCHAPTER 10\nS\ntyke sat astride Amrec a mile northeast of where the Riflejacks had made\ncamp the last few nights and watched the column of infantry marching\ndouble time through the thinning morning fog.

The Palo bannerman sat easy\nin his saddle atop a captured Dynize horse, watching the columns pass.\nStyke nudged Amrec gently around to join him.\n“What do your spirits say about all this?” Styke asked.\nJackal didn’t take his eyes off the passing soldiers. “That we’re all going\nto die.”\n“Oh.” Styke felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.\n“But,” Jackal added, “they always say that. They don’t actually know\nwhen we’re going to die—just that it will happen. Which is pretty obvious.\nSpirits are preoccupied with death.”\nStyke swallowed a lump in his throat. “Was that a joke, Jackal?”\n“I’ve been working with street children for the last few years,” he said\nwithout smiling. “It helped me develop my sense of humor.” He finally\nlooked up from the Riflejack column and gazed at Celine for a few\nmoments. “She’s good for you, I think. Tempers your fury.”\n“I think ten years in the camps tempered my fury.”\n“That’s not what the spirits say,” Jackal replied.\nStyke smoothed Celine’s hair gently with one hand. “I have no idea\nwhether to take you seriously.”\n“You added another to their number a couple hours ago. Agoston, I\nbelieve. He is hiding from me, but the spirits say he betrayed you.” As crazy\nas Jackal sounded sometimes, he always came up with bits of information\nhe had no other way of knowing. It made Styke more than a little\nuncomfortable. Jackal continued. “The spirits say you’re a man of madness.\nThey say Death walks in your footsteps just to find an easier road. Some of\nthem fear you. Some hate you. Some like you.” Jackal’s eyes narrowed.\n“The ones that like you are not sound of mind.”\n“Thanks for that.”\n“They also think this is a terrible idea.”\n“The spirits? What idea?”\n“Searching for the godstones.”\nGoose bumps spread on the back of Styke’s arms. Another piece of\ninformation Jackal hadn’t—or shouldn’t have—been told. “Have you been\nspying on us?”\n“The spirits bring me a lot of information to sort through. One of the\nbraver ones happened to overhear your conversation with Flint and the\nother two.”\n“Taniel and Ka-poel.”\n“The spirits just call them Black and Fire. But yes, them. The spirits\nwant nothing to do with the godstones, and think we shouldn’t, either. The\nstones are surrounded by a cacophony of death so thick that it drives spirits\nto madness.”"

The\nstones are surrounded by a cacophony of death so thick that it drives spirits\nto madness.”\n“I didn’t know the dead could go mad.”\n“Madness can follow them from life. But for a spirit to be driven to\ninsanity after death? That’s something.”\nStyke turned toward Jackal and sniffed, trying to sense any sorcery\nabout him. He thought he detected something—a hint of grave moss and\nfresh-turned dirt—but it was so minuscule it might be his imagination. Was\nJackal using some kind of strange new sorcery? Had a Knack manifested\nitself late in life? Styke should be able to smell it, but he hadn’t used his\nsorcerous senses for ten years, and had never considered the fact he was out\nof practice.\nThey sat in silence for several minutes. In a nearby field, Ibana was\ngathering the Mad Lancers and the Riflejack cavalry for their briefing—\nminus the scouts keeping an eye on the nearby armies. Styke wondered if\nhe made Ibana do too much of his footwork. But that’s what a junior officer\nwas for, was it not? As the senior officer, he sat around, made important\ndecisions. Maybe he’d do some paperwork once in a while, though upon\nreflection he realized he made Ibana do that as well.\nHe glanced sidelong at Jackal. “Can the spirits help us find the\ngodstones?”\nJackal made a sour face. “I asked. It took almost an hour to get them to\ntalk to me again.”\n“So that’s a no.”\n“Definitely no.”\n“Well,” Styke said, lifting his reins. “Tell me if they’re good for\nanything.”\nHe turned Amrec away from the road and headed off across a shallow\ngully to where the cavalry was assembled with Ibana. Halfway to Ibana,\nKa-poel met him on horseback. He pulled up, eyeing her for several long\nmoments. Ka-poel smiled at him, and though he was almost two feet taller\nthan her, he found something incredibly terrifying about the casual intensity\nin her eyes. To his Knack, she smelled of coppery old blood.\n“So we’re to be your bodyguard, are we?”\nShe nodded.\n“Do you ride well?”\nAnother nod.\n“I don’t know your signing language. Is there a better way we can\ncommunicate?”\nShe hesitated, then tapped the side of her head.\n“You’ll think of something?”\nA nod.\n“Try to do it soon.” Styke adjusted Celine in his saddle and wondered\nhow she could sleep so well. Even after three weeks on horseback, his\nthighs and balls still hurt too bad to so much as snooze. To be young again,\nhe mused. “Tell me,” he said to Ka-poel. “Did I dream you in that town\nnorth of Landfall? Did I dream that you wiped blood on my face and\ndisappeared?”\nShe smiled.\n“You can be coy with Taniel and Flint and everyone else. But I’m going\nto keep you alive the next few months. Don’t play with me. Did I dream\nthat?”\nShe snorted, her face growing serious, then shook her head.\n“No, I didn’t dream it, or no, you didn’t do it?”"

Most wore the crimson and blue of the Riflejacks—some\nvolunteers wore whatever they happened to have on them, and the rest wore\nthe old, sunflower-yellow jackets of the Mad Lancers. Everyone was\nmounted, facing toward Ibana and Gustar at the front, and each had the\nreins of an extra horse tied to their saddle.\nThe Mad Lancers had each taken the breastplate of a dead Dynize\ncuirassier. Styke’s hung from his saddle—he needed a smith to hammer it\nout to fit him. Their breastplates weren’t as strong as those of the Riflejack\ncuirassiers, but they were much lighter, and he decided he’d have the\nRiflejack dragoons fitted with them the next time they slaughtered a Dynize\narmy.\n“Some of you know me from old,” Styke began, shouting to be heard\nacross the field. “Some of you have already ridden under my command at\nLandfall. And some of you signed on just in the last few days, in which case\nyou will come to know me soon. But for every one of you here today my\nname is Ben Styke, and I am your new colonel.”\nA thousand pairs of eyes watched him silently. Someone in the back\ncheered, but quickly fell silent.\n“I understand that most of you are here for the money, that you followed\nLady Flint across the ocean in return for riches, so she is the one who holds\nyour loyalty.” Styke held up a finger. “Flint has given us one mission, and\nhas cut us loose. Your soul belongs to her, but your bodies belong to me.\nWhen I tell you to slaughter, you slaughter. When I tell you to burn, you\nburn. When I say charge, you charge. Anyone who has a problem with that\ncan slink back to her right now and explain that you don’t want to follow\norders.”\nNo one moved.\n“Good.” Styke continued. “We will ride hard every day. We will train\nevery day. We will treat our horses with respect. If you fall behind, we will\nnot coddle you—but we will not abandon you, either. You will be taught to\nkeep up. It doesn’t matter whether you are a cuirassier or a dragoon or a\nlancer, or a farmer, or an accountant. From this day forward, you are a Mad\nLancer.\n“Mad Lancers are as kind to our allies as we are cruel to our enemies.\nWe take in the broken and we turn them into warriors. We crush those who\nthink themselves invincible. We thrive on the ravages of war. The Mad\nLancers protect Fatrasta—even from itself. When all this is over, Lady Flint\nhas assured me that all the survivors will be rich. But mark my words: If\nyou disobey my orders, I will kill you myself.”\nStyke took a long moment to enjoy the irony of a man famous for"

But mark my words: If\nyou disobey my orders, I will kill you myself.”\nStyke took a long moment to enjoy the irony of a man famous for\nignoring his superiors expecting unquestioning obedience from his own\ncavalry, before continuing on in a shout: “Welcome to the Mad Lancers. We\nride as brothers and sisters. We die as brothers and sisters. Let’s move out!”\nHe turned immediately to Ibana and Gustar, noting that Celine had\nwoken up during his speech and was looking around groggily. “How was\nthat?”\n“Could have been better,” Ibana said.\n“Go to the pit,” Styke told her.\n“A bit more violent than my boys are used to,” Gustar commented. “But\nI like it.”\n“They’ll learn,” Styke warned. “We aren’t knights in shining armor.\nWe’re killers.”\n“Adrans have few hang-ups about war,” Gustar assured him.\nIbana sighed. “I miss my old armor.” She thumped her Dynize\nbreastplate. “This won’t even stop a good rifle shot.”\n“Quit your whining. It’ll turn a sword or a bayonet. Until we can find\nout where Lindet stashed our armor, this is the best we’ve got.”\nIbana perked up. “We’re going looking for it?”\n“It’s on my list,” Styke said. He didn’t want to get anyone’s hopes up—\nhe wasn’t entirely certain that Lindet hadn’t destroyed it like she said—but\nhe also had a feeling it was floating around in a Blackhat armory\nsomewhere. If it was on the west coast, he was going to find it. “Get the\nmen moving,” he told Gustar. “We’ll head north two more miles, then cut\nthrough the refugee camp and go west. I’d like to skirt them entirely but\nthat would take too long, so we’ll have to be well on our way before Holm\nhas any idea we passed through.”\nGustar snapped a salute and rode off, shouting for the men to form\ncolumns.\n“We’ve got a lot of new volunteers,” Styke said, looking over the\ncavalry. “Are you sure you’re going to be able to whip them into shape?”\nIbana scoffed. “You may be an old cripple, but I’m in the prime of my\nlife. If we turned farmers and dockhands into cavalry during the Fatrastan\nWar, we can do it now.” She paused for a moment. “I’m surprised you said\nyes to this. That eager to be cut loose?”\nStyke considered the question for several moments, looking down at\nCeline, who was content to watch the activity without comment. “The\nlonger we stick around, the more likely it’ll be that Flint and I come to\nblows. I don’t want that to happen.”\n“Sure.”\n“But it’s not just that. Flint has sent us west. What’s to the west?”\nIbana shrugged.\nStyke held up three fingers. “Bad Tenny Wiles, Valayine, and Dvory.”\nA wicked little smile crossed Ibana’s face.\nStyke continued. “I figure there’s a pretty good chance we come across\nthose bastards while we look for this thing for Lady Flint—and I really like"

He left notes for Hendres\nat preordained drop points, tried to chase down a handful of trusted\ncontacts, and stewed in his own frustration at a small hovel on the edge of\nGreenfire Depths—the first address on Taniel’s list of resources.\nHe was just about to give up hope that Hendres had escaped the Dynize\nwhen he found a note at one of the drop points. Still alive. Safe house\ncompromised. Meet at 14 Laural Way, 2 p.m. Will wait for two days.\nHendres’s neat handwriting was unmistakable.\nThe meeting spot was in a posh area of Landfall called Middle Heights.\nBefore the invasion, it was the favored locale of the Fatrastan elite. The\nstreets were wide and cobbled, lined with immense townhouses, with every\nstreet corner lit by gaslight during the night. There were museums, theaters,\nand fine restaurants—even Michel’s favorite whorehouse was in Middle\nHeights, though he could rarely afford it.\nSince the invasion, everything had changed. Middle Heights was\npractically a ghost town. Homes and businesses were boarded up in a vain\nattempt to prevent looting. Only about one in ten residences was still\noccupied, and the big public buildings were either guarded by Dynize\nsoldiers or had been taken over by squatters.\nRumor had it that the Dynize planned on moving their own low-level\nbureaucracy into the mansions of Middle Heights, but so far there was only\nan average Dynize presence in the area.\nMichel headed to the indicated meeting spot an hour early and did a\nslow walk around the block. Fourteen Laural Way was a big theater—only a\nfew years old, it was the pride of some Brudanian investors, with an\nimmense stone facade decorated by gargoyles and columns. The\nnewspapers spoke much about the mazelike tunnels beneath the main stage\nwith state-of-the-art lever-and-pulley systems that would allow actors to\ndescend from the catwalks or pop up from the floor anywhere onstage.\nThere was graffiti on the outside walls admonishing the Dynize invaders\nin Palo, and the tents of homeless squatters covered the immense floor of\nthe columned front portico.\nMichel walked through the tents, glancing in at the faces. They were\nmostly Palo—refugees from the fires in Greenfire Depths—and no one\nquestioned him as he passed. He tried the front door to find it barricaded\nfrom inside, then headed around to the alleyways, his eyes sharp for Dynize\nsoldiers, though it soon became clear that he needn’t worry. The Dynize had\nclearly decided to ignore this place, at least for now.\nMichel did a second circuit of the block, eyeing the squatters and\nchecking the windows and roofs of the nearby townhouses before heading\nback around to the front steps and settling down to wait.

Thirty minutes\npassed, then an hour, and it was almost two thirty before he finally spotted\nHendres hurrying down the street toward him.\nHe stood up, hands clasped behind his back, and frowned. She walked\nhurriedly, her eyes on the doorways of the townhouses as she passed them,\nconstantly searching. She seemed … off. “Ignore it,” he whispered to\nhimself. “She’s had a rough couple of days, too.”\n“She’s carrying a pistol beneath her jacket,” he retorted. “You better\ndamn well keep your eyes peeled.” He still glanced over his shoulder,\nchecking his escape route around the back of the theater.\nShe spotted him and crossed the street, picking her way slowly through\nthe tents, her face worried. He tried to give her a reassuring smile and raised\nhis hand in greeting. “Glad to see you in one piece,” he said.\nHendres flashed a quick smile, and Michel felt that same gut response\nhe’d gotten outside of the safe house a few days ago. Something was\nwrong. He could see it in her gait and in her face. He did a quick glance\naround, looking for any sign of Dynize soldiers, but came up with nothing.\n“What’s wrong?” he asked.\n“I’m fine,” she said. “Still a little shaken up. I … went out after you did\nthe other day. It was pure luck that I wasn’t there when the Dynize showed\nup.”\nMichel ran a hand through his hair. “Shit. I was hoping you’d be able to\ntell me why they were there.”\n“Why would I be able to tell you?” The words were a little too quick,\naccompanied by a look full of suspicion.\nTwo and two clicked together in Michel’s head, and he held up his\nhands. “You don’t think I tipped them off, do you?”\nHendres hesitated. She did. She definitely did, and that had Michel\nworried. “I don’t know,” she said.\n“I didn’t tip anyone off,” Michel assured her. “I came back that evening\nand spotted them staking out the safe house. I’m glad you did the same.\nShit, shit.” He began to pace, his mind racing. Not only did he have to\nfigure out why the Dynize were at his safe house, but he also had to\nconvince Hendres he hadn’t betrayed her. “Look, one of us might have been\nfollowed. We might have been sold out, or we might have just gotten\nunlucky—the Dynize are cracking down more than ever since those\ngrenades the other day. We need to find another safe house and regroup. We\nhave to make sure our routes out of the city haven’t been compromised,\ntoo.”\n“I …” Hendres seemed to consider his words, the corners of her eyes\ntightening. Her mouth formed into a firm line, and she said, “I don’t think\nso.”\n“What do you mean?” The last word had barely left Michel’s mouth\nwhen he heard footsteps behind him.

Her name was Aethel, and he recognized her as an Iron Rose who\nhad worked beneath him on occasion the last few years. She ambled up\nbehind him, her jaw set. Michel forced down a rising panic and shoved his\nhands into his pockets. “What’s going on, Hendres?”\n“You betrayed us,” Hendres said, her tone flat. “You betrayed me.”\n“I didn’t tip off those Dynize,” Michel hissed.\n“Don’t lie to me.”\n“I’m not! This is a damned big misunderstanding. We need to go\nsomewhere and talk this out.”\nHendres gave a resigned sigh, her lip curling. “I saw you with him,\nMichel.”\n“Who?”\n“The other day. The day the Dynize found our safe house? I saw you\nmeeting with the Red Hand.”\nMichel felt the bottom of his stomach drop out. He swallowed hard,\nsearching for words.\nHendres continued. “I came back to find the safe house being watched.\nI’m not a spy, Michel, but I’m not an idiot, either. I did a little asking\naround. You were with the Red Hand when Fidelis Jes died. You met with\nhim again the other day. You’re a damned traitor. You’re going to come with\nus now and tell us everything you know, or this is going to get very painful\nfor you. Don’t make it worse.”\nMichel’s mouth was dry. He knew Blackhats better than most, and he\nknew the line she’d just fed him was bullshit—if he went with them, it\nwouldn’t matter what he said. Things would get painful either way. He\nsqueezed his eyes closed for a moment, feeling every bit of control slip\naway from him. This … this wasn’t how it was supposed to go.\nThe fingers of his right hand slipped into his knuckle-dusters. “Look,”\nhe said, pulling his hands slowly out of his pockets. He heard another\nfootstep behind him, judged the distance, and turned around, cocking Aethel\nin the side of the jaw.\nIt took the Iron Rose completely by surprise. Aethel crumpled, and\nMichel stumbled past her and broke into a run, heading for the alley around\nthe back of the theater.\n“You piece of shit,” he heard Hendres shout. The words were followed\nby the blast of a pistol, and he ducked as a bullet ricocheted off the stone\nfacade of the theater just above his head. Hendres swore again, louder, and\nhe heard her footsteps pound after him.\nHe rounded the side of the theater and headed down the alley, leaping\ntrash and dodging the tents of squatters. Faces watched with concern as he\nraced by, no doubt drawn out by the sound of the pistol shot. Michel was a\ncouple dozen yards from the next street when a figure loomed in the mouth\nof the alley.\nIt was Geddi, a short, stocky Iron Rose with black hair and a beard.\nMichel skidded to a stop, glancing over his shoulder to see Hendres bearing\ndown on him, fury in her eyes. She held the pistol by the barrel, raised\nabove her head to strike."

She held the pistol by the barrel, raised\nabove her head to strike.\nMichel’s only option was the chimney sweep’s ladder going up the side\nof the theater. He slipped the knuckle-dusters back into his pants pocket and\nleapt for the lowest rung, pulling himself up. He scrambled up the ladder,\nonly stopping when he reached a window ledge about forty feet up. He\nhooked his toe between the ladder rung and the wall and took off his jacket,\nwrapping it around his fist in one swift motion and punching it through the\nwindow. He swept off the jagged edges and leapt inside.\nHe entered through an office that had obviously been ransacked. Papers\nlay scattered on every surface and a large safe stood open in one corner.\nMichel dashed across the room and out into the hall, racing through the\ndarkness and down a flight of stairs. He twisted his ankle as he reached the\nlanding, swearing to himself quietly and pausing just long enough to listen\nfor sound of pursuit.\nNothing.\nHe continued on down to the next floor and then along another hallway,\nthis one pitch-black. He navigated by feel and the memory of a previous\nvisit, when he’d come here to do a favor for one of the theater investors.\nWithin moments he burst out a door, around a narrow turn, and out into the\nlobby.\nThe lobby had seen better days. A few squatters had taken up residence\nbelow the enormous stained-glass skylight, and they looked up at him as he\nentered. The front door was blocked by a chair from one of the offices.\nMichel dismissed it as an exit, worried about running into Aethel or\nHendres. He looked down to the other side of the lobby, where he knew that\na hidden door allowed performers to pass beneath the theater seats and pop\nup to entertain guests before a show.\nHe was just a few steps down the main staircase when there was a\nsudden crash. The front door burst open, the chair flying, and a very angry-\nlooking Aethel strode through the opening. Michel grabbed the banister and\nspun himself around, heading back up. He reached the main theater and\nthrew the curtain aside, running recklessly down the aisle with little regard\nfor his twisted ankle or the possibility of breaking something during his\ndescent. Aside from the little light coming in through the way he’d just\nentered, the theater was pitch-black.\nHe reached the bottom and threw himself to the floor. Back up at the\nlobby entrance, he saw a tall silhouette, and Aethel called out, “We’re going\nto find you, traitor. And I’m going to kill you myself.”\n“So much for talking my way out of this,” Michel muttered to himself.\nHe crawled quickly along the floor, around the orchestra pit, and up onto\nthe stage.\n“He’s down here,” he heard Aethel call. A moment later there was a\nsecond silhouette briefly outlined by the light from the lobby. Hendres.\n“Geddi,” Hendres shouted, “see if you can find the gas line for the main\ntheater. Turn on the lights, and he’s ours.”\nAethel responded with something that Michel could not understand, but\nhe used it to pinpoint her position about halfway up the theater seating."

Turn on the lights, and he’s ours.”\nAethel responded with something that Michel could not understand, but\nhe used it to pinpoint her position about halfway up the theater seating.\nQuietly, he slipped his shoes off and soft-footed his way across the stage\nand into the wings. He tried to see something—anything—in the inky\ndarkness behind the curtains. His memory of a brief tour of the backstage\nwas fuzzy, and he followed it haphazardly into the darkness, barking his\nshins on crates and running into stage props.\nMichel finally found an empty hall and followed it down a flight of\nstairs and through two curtains before emerging into the storage area\nbeneath the stage. A dim light coming from street-level windows at the far\nend of the long room allowed him to pick out the dressing areas and the\nenormous set pieces. Everything was set up as if for a performance—likely\nforgotten when news came of the invasion.\nMichel paused long enough to put his shoes back on, then began to head\nto the far side of the room, where he thought he remembered an exit that\ncame out on the other side of the street behind the theater.\nThe figure that emerged from the next stairwell took him entirely by\nsurprise. He only got a quick glance—enough to see the stocky figure of\nGeddi coming out of the shadows—before he was grabbed by the shoulders\nand thrown through an enormous canvas painting of a wooded countryside.\nMichel stumbled and fell on the other side, crashing into an array of\npulleys with enough force to rattle his teeth. He pulled himself up, only in\ntime to catch Geddi’s fist in his kidneys.\nHe’d seen Geddi work before. Geddi was considered, even among Iron\nRoses, to be the go-to man for roughing up an enemy of the Chancellor’s\noffice. The blow doubled Michel over and sent him reeling into a wooden\nset piece, gasping for breath and holding up one hand in the vain hope of\nstalling Geddi’s approach.\n“He’s down here!” Geddi shouted. He reached out and snagged Michel\nby the arm.\nTo Michel’s surprise, he managed to slip right out of Geddi’s grip,\nallowing him a precious few seconds to backpedal. He snatched his\nknuckle-dusters from his pocket and forced himself into a boxer’s stance,\nonly then noticing that his left arm was coated with blood. Michel didn’t\nhave time to consider it. Geddi came on quickly, fists swinging.\nMichel stepped to one side, taking a glancing blow to the shoulder, and\nslammed his fist into Geddi’s temple as hard as he could. Geddi took two\nwobbly steps to one side, touching his cheek, fingers coming away bloody.\nMichel didn’t give him the time to focus. He grabbed one of Geddi’s thick\nforearms and smashed his knuckle-dusters into Geddi’s elbow until Geddi\nbegan to scream. He pulled back, punched him one more time in the side of\nthe head, and turned and ran.\nMichel backtracked, past the stairway he’d descended from and all the\nway to the wall of the under-stage, where he found a narrow corridor\nleading into the darkness. Hoping he knew what he was doing, he placed his\npalms on both walls of the corridor to keep his balance and hurried down it."

The\ndoor boomed against the floor as Michel came through it, and he didn’t\nbother to pause as he scrambled out the front door and into the street.\nIn the light of day, he found his left arm deeply gouged by the glass of\nthe window he’d broken. There was blood on his face from hitting the\npulleys, and a deep pain in his side from Geddi’s punches. The self-\nexamination took him just a few seconds. He spotted a curious Palo looking\nout from his tent on the front steps of the theater. “You,” Michel said,\nsearching his pockets. He came up with a booklet of meal vouchers for the\nDynize market out by the docks. He shoved it into the Palo’s hands. “Sell\nme your jacket. Quickly! And if someone comes out that door, tell them I\nwent that way.”\nMichel practically pulled the jacket off the poor Palo and hurried across\nthe street and down an alley. He zigzagged through afternoon traffic, hoping\nhis bloody face and arm didn’t attract too much attention. He was half a\ndozen blocks from the theater before he finally allowed himself to rest in a\ndirty alleyway outside a baker’s shop. He stared at the blood dripping from\nhis fingers and the knuckle-dusters still on his other hand, and felt true\ndespair for the first time since the Dynize had invaded.\nHendres knew who he really was.

She relished the shock of the cold water coming out of\nthe foothills, scrubbing her cheeks, enjoying the moment of respite. She\nclimbed to her feet and dried off with a handkerchief, turning to find the\nscout standing a few feet behind her. It was late in the afternoon and she\nknew she would have to give the order to make camp soon, but she wanted\nher infantry to eke out another mile or two before nightfall.\n“What happened?” she asked the scout.\n“The Dynize turned to follow us when we left,” the scout reported.\n“They sent a brigade in our tracks, but the Fatrastans engaged around noon\nand the brigade was forced to pull back.”\n“Full engagement?” Vlora asked hopefully. “Did you see the battle?”\n“No, ma’am. Just skirmishing. Last I saw before coming to report was\nthe Dynize consolidating.”\n“Very good.” Vlora wiped her hands on her handkerchief and returned it\nto her pocket, dismissing the scout. She turned her face toward the sun and\nclosed her eyes, listening to the tramp of marching soldiers making their\nway along the winding road of the foothills just a few hundred yards down\nthe creek. A pair of swallows chased each other overhead.\n“That was a clever bit of maneuvering.”\nVlora jumped, her pistol halfway out of her belt before she spotted\nTaniel sitting just above her on the hillside.

        "text": "“That was a clever bit of maneuvering.”\nVlora jumped, her pistol halfway out of her belt before she spotted\nTaniel sitting just above her on the hillside. He wore his buckskins,\nmatching satchels hanging from his shoulders, and leaned on his Hrusch\nrifle with a casual air as if he’d been there for an hour. She felt a spike of\nannoyance, and couldn’t help but think that she wouldn’t be in this mess if\nnot for him. “Don’t sneak up on me.”\n“Sorry.”\n“Don’t be sorry. Just don’t do it.” Vlora returned to her horse for her\ncanteens and filled them at the creek. She was suddenly self-conscious,\naware of Taniel’s gaze following her. “Did Ka-poel get away fine with the\nMad Lancers?”\nTaniel spread his legs, laying his rifle across them and checking the flint\nand pan. “She did. They’re southwest of us right now and riding hard. As\nfar as we know, they’re not being followed.”\nThis information surprised Vlora. “You can speak with her at a\ndistance?”\n“Not exactly.” Taniel looked suddenly uncomfortable. “We can sense\neach other—feel each other’s pains and attitudes. It’s very rudimentary, but\nit’s a sort of communication.”\n“That sounds convenient.”\n“It’s a pain in the ass, actually. If she feels pain a hundred miles from\nme, there’s nothing I can do about it, and vice versa. It can be comforting,\nbut it can also make me anxious as pit.”\nVlora tried to dredge up some sympathy. There wasn’t much to find, so\nshe walked up the side of the hill and sat down next to him. “Tell me about\nwhere we’re going.”\n“I don’t know much myself,” Taniel admitted. “All I could find in\nLindet’s private archives was a reference to a place called Yellow Creek. As\nfar as I could tell, she’d been working off old Dynize texts to pinpoint the\nlocation of the other godstones using translations and some sort of\nmathematical formula her Privileged had cooked up.”\nVlora felt a sudden weight in her stomach. “You mean this could be a\nwild-goose chase?”\nTaniel lifted his hands defensively. “If I thought it was a wild-goose\nchase, I wouldn’t have offered to pay you a rather large fortune for your\nhelp. Lindet’s not the only one who’s been looking for all three godstones,\nand the two guesses she’s mapped out for our missing artifacts are in the\nsame area as my own estimates. That can’t be coincidence.”\n“That doesn’t make me feel any better.” Vlora mulled it over. No use\nwishing to be somewhere else—the deal was struck, and she and her men\nwere in this for the long haul. “Yellow Creek. The name sounds familiar.”\n“It’s a mining town,” Taniel said. “They—”\nVlora cut him off, remembering an article she’d read in the newspaper\nalmost a year ago. “They struck gold there, right? A big-time haul.\nThousands of prospectors from all over the world have gathered there.”\n“Right.”\n“What else?”\n“That’s about all I know.” Taniel grimaced. “Well, maybe not all I\nknow.”"

Taniel himself\nwas enough of a surprise and a mystery that she didn’t need anything else.\nShe wanted this job to be as straightforward as possible; track down the\ngodstone, smash anything or anyone who gets in the way, then figure out\nhow to destroy the thing. The moment it was in a thousand pieces she\nintended to be on a boat back to Adro.\n“There’s a complication with Yellow Creek. Technically, the land it’s on\nis claimed by three different countries.”\n“Who?”\n“Fatrasta, Brudania, and the Palo Nation.”\nVlora wasn’t surprised about the first two. Lindet had claimed the entire\ncontinent for her country and was fighting for the legality of her claim with\nhalf a dozen colonial powers who still held some land in Fatrasta. But the\nother? She tried to search her memories. The Palo were spread out in a\nthousand tribes over a landmass almost as large as the Nine. The actual\nnation of Fatrasta claimed the whole continent of the same name, but in\nreality only controlled pieces on the eastern and southern coasts. There were\nmillions of square miles of dense forest northwest of the Ironhook\nMountains that only a few Kressians had ever managed to penetrate.\nThe Palo Nation was a coalition of those northern tribes, but she’d never\nheard anything about them beyond conjecture. To Vlora’s knowledge,\nLindet’s frontier armies had only ever fought tribes who themselves had\nopposed the Palo Nation, bringing back rumors of walled cities, farmland,\nand even organized government. It seemed like a fairy tale back when Vlora\nwas putting down insurrections by tribes still living in huts in the swamps.\n“I didn’t know the Palo Nation claimed land. In fact, I don’t know much\nabout them at all.”\n“No one does,” Taniel said, kicking at a clod of dirt with his heel.\n“Which makes them dangerous. Last I heard, they were contesting gold\nclaims in the Ironhook Mountains. I’m not actually sure what that means,\nthough.”\n“So we might reach Yellow Creek and find a Palo army waiting for us?”\n“I’m guessing we’re more likely to find the town being harassed by a\nskirmishing party. Either way, we should be ready for violence.”\nVlora pursed her lips. “I suppose that’s my job, anyway.” She\nconsidered the facts for a few moments, realizing how little she knew. “I\ndon’t want to march into contested territory without scouting it first.”\n“I wouldn’t expect you to,” Taniel said. “But if you want to make camp\nand scout out Yellow Creek, you can’t take long.”\n“Why not?”\n“Because at some point, Lindet is going to find out what we’re up to and\nsend a whole field army to come bury us.”\n“Or,” Vlora mused, “the Dynize will crush Lindet’s troops and try to\nfigure out where we went.”\n“Either one.”\nVlora got to her feet, dusting off her trousers. “It’s settled, then.”"

I’m going to find Olem.”\nOlem was at the rear of the army, riding along behind the last few carts of\nprovisions in the long and winding column. He wore a thoughtful\nexpression, leaning back in his saddle with a hand gently patting his horse’s\nflank as he hummed a tune.\n“I just sent someone to find you,” he said by way of greeting.\nVlora waited by the road and then nudged her horse up next to his,\nletting them walk together. “Anything important?” she asked.\n“Another of our rear scouts just reported in. The Dynize and Fatrastan\nfield armies skirmished all afternoon, but it looks like they’ve made camp\non either side of the river and are content to feel each other out—for now.”\n“That could be ideal for us.”\n“Could be,” Olem agreed. “Both armies have a handful of scouts\nfollowing us. They want to know where we’re headed.”\nThat was decidedly not ideal. They couldn’t hide a whole army, of\ncourse, not even up in the Ironhook foothills, but she’d hoped to make a\nclean break that would keep their location a mystery for at least a few\nweeks. “How many horses did we keep for ourselves?”\n“Sixty dragoons,” Olem said. “Everyone else went with Styke.”\nVlora chewed on the number, watching as Taniel rode over a nearby hill\nand joined them. “Leave twenty of them behind to set some ambushes,” she\ntold Olem. “Scare off the scouts or delay them; just buy us a little more time\nuntil they figure out where we’re heading. I don’t want either the Fatrastans\nor Dynize following us to Yellow Creek.”\n“Will do.”\n“With any luck, the two armies will be so tied up with each other that\nwe’re an afterthought. At least for now.” She glanced at Taniel, who’d hung\nhis rifle from his saddle and pulled out a sketchbook. He began to sketch\nquickly, his eyes on the hillside to their left, expertly dashing bits of\ncharcoal against the paper along with the cadence of his horse’s gait. “We\nhave a problem,” she said to Olem.\n“Which is?”\n“We know nothing about what we’re walking into.”\n“Yellow Creek?” Olem produced a prerolled cigarette from his pocket\nand offered it to Vlora, then to Taniel. They both shook their heads. He\nshrugged and lit it for himself. “It’s a gold-rush town. I’ve got nothing more\nthan that.”\n“That’s what Taniel said, too,” Vlora said, jerking her thumb at Taniel,\nwho’d covered half the page of his sketchbook in charcoal markings in less\nthan a minute. “But that doesn’t really help us.”\n“What do you propose?” Olem asked.\nVlora hesitated. “You’re not going to like this.”\n“You want to go ahead and scout it yourself, don’t you?” Olem ashed his"

At best the locals will send\nrunners to all the closest cities asking for help, thinking we’re trying to\nmove in on their claims. At worst, we’ll run into a stubborn militia and\nwon’t even be able to get into the town without bloodshed.”\nOlem fixed her with a long, steady gaze. “And sending me with a squad\nisn’t an option?”\n“Even in plain clothes, you’ll stand out,” Vlora replied. “A squad of\nsoldiers always looks like a squad of soldiers, even when dressing down.”\nTaniel suddenly put away his charcoal, flipping the leather cover over\nhis sketchbook before she could see what he’d been drawing. He looked\nfrom Vlora to Olem, then said, “There isn’t anything in Yellow Creek that\nVlora and I can’t handle.”\n“I don’t remember inviting you,” Vlora said, turning to Taniel.\n“Do you know what we’re looking for?” Taniel asked.\n“An obelisk seeped in sorcery and covered in Dynize writing.”\n“Maybe.”\n“What do you mean, maybe?”\n“We have no idea if the godstones all look the same,” Taniel said. “Until\nMichel told me about the one outside Landfall, I thought I was looking for\nan artifact the size of a pair of saddlebags. We still might be. Besides, my\nsenses are more highly tuned than yours. If we get within a hundred yards\nor so of the godstone, I should be able to find it.”\nVlora and Olem exchanged a glance. “Give us a minute,” she told\nTaniel. She pulled gently on her reins, coming to a stop while Olem did the\nsame. They waited for almost a minute as the column marched on, until\nthey wouldn’t be overheard even by Taniel’s powder-mage senses.\n“Do you trust him?” Olem asked.\nIt was a question Vlora had been mulling over for weeks. “I trust him to\nnot get me killed.”\n“And beyond that?”\n“I have no idea,” she confessed. “I’m still not even sure what he is. Bo\ntold me he’s become something more than just a powder mage—he’s\ntranscended into something new.” She considered Borbador—her and\nTaniel’s mutual adopted brother—wishing briefly that he was riding\nalongside her. He would know what to make of Taniel.\nOlem took a drag on his cigarette. “That doesn’t give me a lot of\nconfidence. You should at least take our mages with you.”\n“And leave the army undefended against Privileged or bone-eyes?”\nVlora shook her head. “Not a chance.”\n“Just one,” Olem pressed. “Take Norrine. She’s known Taniel for longer\nthan you have. She’ll watch both of your backs, and can pull you out of\ntrouble if Taniel gets himself into something only he can handle.”"

Look, I can handle Taniel. I can handle a gold-\nrush town. You’ve got to trust me on this. I’m going to leave you in\ncommand and I need to know that you’re focused on that and not spending\nall your energy worrying about me.”\nOlem looked at her glumly. He spat into the weeds and let out a sigh.\n“Fine.”\n“Good. As long as no one is on our tail, you can let the army take it easy\nfrom here to Yellow Creek. Find somewhere a dozen miles outside the city\nto camp and send someone in to find us. With any luck we’ll have already\ndestroyed the godstone and be ready to leave.”\n“You don’t have that much luck.”\n“No,” Vlora agreed. “I don’t.” She paused, thinking about Bo again. “Do\nme another favor.”\n“What’s that?”\n“Dispatch a letter to Adopest. Send three copies with three different\ncouriers so you know it gets there.”\n“From here? It’ll be six weeks on the fastest ship.”\n“Send it anyway. I want Bo to know what’s going on here. Tell him\nabout the godstones, and that both Lindet and the Dynize want to use\nthem.”\nOlem barked a laugh. “That sounds like a trail of catnip for a kitten. Do\nyou really want Bo to come here? I’m not entirely certain he won’t throw\nhis own hat in the ring to become a god.”\n“Bo is a lot of things, but power hungry is not one of them. He may\nshow up with the intent to study the damn things, but …” She trailed off.\n“But what?”\n“But I think having him here would do more good than harm. If only\nslightly.” She paused. “Oh, and tell him to bring his better half. I wouldn’t\nmind having the strongest Privileged in the Nine standing over my\nshoulder.”\n“I know they’re your friends,” Olem said softly, “but involving them\ncould be dangerous.”\n“Then I better hurry,” Vlora replied. “So that this whole business is\nfinished before Bo can even set sail.” She flipped her reins, riding to catch\nup with the army and calling over her shoulder, “I leave first thing in the\nmorning. I expect to see you in my tent at sundown, Colonel.”\nCHAPTER 13\nA\nfter twenty-four hours, Michel still couldn’t stop the bleeding.\nThere were three long slices down his left arm, all from the glass at the\ntheater. One was manageable, but the other two were far worse than he’d\nfirst expected. His one-handed stitch job was sloppy at best—constantly\npulling out—and it seemed as if the cuts began to bleed again every time he\nmoved.\nHe stayed in Taniel’s hovel of a safe house for the entire morning, trying\nto fix the stitches while he considered his next course of action. He started\nby cursing himself for allowing Hendres to follow him that afternoon he\nmet with Taniel.

He hadn’t even considered that she might, and the\noversight had cost him both her friendship and whatever resources were still\nleft to the Blackhats in Landfall. Manpower, food, and safe houses were all\ncompromised.\nHe wondered if, perhaps, he could still use Blackhat resources sparingly.\nHendres couldn’t spread the word that far, not with the Dynize hunting\ndown any Blackhat left in the city. He might be able to get to some of his\ncontacts first, throwing suspicion on Hendres. If he found the Gold Roses\nthat Taniel said had stayed behind … well, that would be something.\nMichel made a list of the contacts he knew had remained in the city. It\nwas pitifully short, and even shorter when he crossed off the ones that\nHendres knew about. Despair began to set in—quietly at first, nagging at\nthe back of his mind, then slowly growing. The pain from his arm made it\ndifficult to think straight.\nThe more he considered that he was in an occupied city, cut off from\nTaniel and now friendless, the more he considered abandoning Taniel’s\nmission and fleeing Landfall. Was this Dynize informant really important\nenough to face these odds?\nHe forced himself to breathe deeply, drinking straight from a bottle of\nwhiskey to dull the pain.\nHe wasn’t completely friendless. Taniel had left him with a number of\ncontacts. They were only to be used in an emergency, but this was\nbeginning to feel as if it qualified. Michel needed information, resources,\nand best of all—someone who could stitch up his arm. He picked a name\nfrom his mental list of Taniel’s contacts. It had been marked specifically as\nsomeone Michel could trust to speak freely around, which sounded like a\ndamned good start.\nMichel wrapped his left arm tightly and put on a shirt and jacket, then\nheaded out into the street. He wore a flatcap and a high-collared style of\njacket he had not worn around Hendres. The journey was uneventful, and he\nsoon found himself entering a small building on the northern side of the\nHadshaw Gorge, marked with the single word MORGUE.\n“This isn’t a good idea,” he whispered to himself.\n“Taniel said he could be trusted.”\nMichel licked his lips. “I’m not talking about that. The morgue is\nunderground. I don’t know all the exits.”\n“Don’t be a baby,” he responded to himself. “It’s not a doctor, but a\nmortician is going to be able to stitch you up better than you can yourself.\nGet in there.”\nReluctantly, he obeyed his own promptings. There was an empty\nreception desk and little else but a stairway that led down into the plateau,\nso Michel followed it down, thankful for the gas lamps that lit every\nlanding. The air grew cool, and he soon picked up the butcher-like smell of\ncorpses and the harsh, chemical scent of embalming fluid. The staircase\nfinally ended, leaving him in a long, wide hallway cut into the rock. Open\ndoors led off either side of the hall, and as he passed them, he saw dozens of\nbodies in various states of undress and of obviously diverse deaths laid out"

He was an albino, tall and slim with a receding\nhairline in a shock of fine white hair. He stood straight, chin lifted, peering\ndown his nose through a pair of green-tinted glasses at a body laid out in\nfront of him. As Michel watched, the albino painted black dotted lines on\nthe corpse with a tiny brush, stopping occasionally to examine his work and\nrub out one of the lines with his thumb before correcting it.\nMichel cleared his throat.\nThe albino looked up at him, blinking in surprise behind those green-\ntinted glasses. “Ah, hello? I’m sorry, I didn’t see you there. If you’re\ndropping off, we’re almost out of space, but you can put up to three more\nbodies in room seven.”\n“I’m not dropping off,” Michel responded. “I’m looking for someone.”\n“I see.” The albino spoke in clean, crisp Adran, and Michel immediately\npegged him as well studied. It was the accent of someone with the best\neducation. “I am the only one here, unfortunately. Unless you’re looking for\nme, I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to go. The morgue is not open to the\npublic.”\n“Are you Emerald?”\nThe albino examined Michel for a moment before making a gentle hmm\nsound and setting down his paintbrush. He tapped his green-tinted glasses.\n“Emerald is a nickname. My real name is Kevi Karivenrian, and I am the\nchief mortician at the Landfall City Morgue.”\n“Right. You’re the one I’m looking for.” Michel took off his jacket and\nrolled up his sleeve to reveal blood-soaked bandages. “If it’s not too much\ntrouble, I need you to stitch this up for me.”\nEmerald looked taken aback. “You want a doctor, sir. I think someone\nhas sent you to me as a joke.” His eyes narrowed. “Tell me, who gave you\nthat name? Emerald? Only my friends know me by that.”\n“Look, I don’t know you, but we have a mutual friend. His name is\nTaniel.”\nEmerald made that hmm sound again. “I see. And you are?”\n“Michel Bravis, at your service. Or rather, I’m hoping you’ll be at\nmine.” Michel indicated his wounded arm with a hopefully charming smile.\n“Do you have a password?”\n“ ‘Touch the noontime bells,’” Michel responded. It was the last\npassword he’d used with any of Taniel’s people. He hoped it was current.\n“ ‘And listen to them ring,’” Emerald finished. “Well, then, Michel\nBravis, give me your arm.” He took Michel gently by the shoulder and led\nhim to a workbench in the corner, where he quickly began to unwrap\nMichel’s bandages. “I was told you’d only contact me in the event of an\nemergency,” he spoke as he worked, a flash of annoyance crossing his face."

Has it all gone wrong so quickly?”\nMichel considered how to answer. Taniel had expressed complete trust\nin his contacts, but he hadn’t actually told Michel how much information\nthey knew. Emerald knew both Taniel and Michel’s real names, so that was\na start. “It hasn’t gone … well.”\n“I would say it hasn’t.” Emerald finished unwrapping the arm and turned\nit one way, then the other, to examine the three cuts. “I have seen rheumatic\nblind men make tighter stitches than these.”\n“Thanks,” Michel said flatly. “Can you fix them?”\n“I have doctorates from four different medical colleges. If I can’t do a\nbetter job than this, I should kill myself now.” He rummaged through his\nworkbench before coming up with a needle and thread. Without warning, he\nbegan to pick out Michel’s stitches.\n“Ow.”\n“Oh, yes. This will sting a little. Tell me, Michel, does Taniel know that\nthe Blackhats have turned on you? Or was that after he left?” Michel tried\nto pull his arm away, but Emerald snatched him by the bicep with his free\nhand. “Hold still, please.”\nMichel swore under his breath. “How much do you know?”\n“You don’t know whether to trust me,” Emerald stated. He finished\npulling the stitches from one cut and began to redo them, working quickly\nand precisely.\n“That’s about the size of it.”\n“I know a lot,” Emerald said. “I have been friends with Taniel and Ka-\npoel for about eight years now. Ka-poel uses my spare mortuary rooms to\npractice her blood magic. I know about the Red Hand and your infiltration\nof the Blackhats—though he only filled me in on that last week. I do not\nknow why you are still in the city, and I will not ask.”\nMichel didn’t know how to respond. He winced as Emerald tightened a\nstitch. “Well. That’s … a lot more than I expected.”\n“I am Taniel’s eyes and ears within Landfall.”\n“You’re a spy.”\n“Indeed I am.”\nMichel processed this information. He had expected to be sent to “a guy\nwho knows a guy,” not directly to Taniel’s spymaster. He realized\nimmediately how dangerous it was for them to meet directly like this and\nwhy Taniel had instructed to only meet his contacts in an emergency. If\neither Michel or Emerald were caught and tortured, they could reveal the\nwhereabouts of the other. “He didn’t tell me,” Michel said quietly.\n“He wouldn’t have.”\n“You were the only contact on his list that he said could be trusted\nimplicitly.”\nEmerald paused his stitching and rested his elbows on the workbench\nbefore looking at Michel over his glasses and letting out a soft sigh. “I\napologize for being cold. You’re not a stupid man, so I’m guessing you’ve\nalready realized the risks you took coming here.”\n“I have.”\n“But since my job is to know things, I am well aware of your break with\nthe Blackhats.”\nMichel hesitated.

Every bit of information that Emerald shared could be\na weapon against either of them. “You have eyes in the Blackhats?”\n“I do.”\n“I’m not sure myself how bad it is,” Michel admitted. “My companion\n—Hendres—followed me to my meeting with Taniel. Then the Dynize\nfound our safe house, and she assumed that I’m working for both the Red\nHand and the Dynize.”\n“Sloppy.”\n“I know.”\n“No, I meant these stitches.” Emerald paused. “But yes, allowing her to\nfollow you was sloppy as well. I know this: There is a Gold Rose remaining\nin the city.”\n“Taniel told me.”\nEmerald went on as if he’d not been interrupted. “I’m not sure which\nGold Rose was left behind, but they are attempting to re-form the Blackhats\nas a spy network to funnel information back to Lindet. Hendres has made\ncontact with them. Most of the Blackhats are now on the alert, and know to\nlook out for you.”\n“Shit.” There went Michel’s possibility of creating a schism within the\nBlackhats. He couldn’t risk using their caches or safe houses now, either.\nOne chance meeting could get him killed—or worse, captured. “Do I have\nany chance of getting back in with them?”\n“That’s not for me to judge,” Emerald said. “But I do know that several\nBlackhats who remained behind were with Fidelis Jes when he died. They\ncorroborated Hendres’s story. They are very confident that you are a\ntraitor.”\n“So much for that.” Michel closed his eyes, trying to ignore the stab-\nand-pull of Emerald’s needle. He had a whole boatload of new enemies,\nmany of whom knew what he looked like. The escape routes he and\nHendres had put together could no longer be risked, which meant he’d have\nto figure out another way of getting Taniel’s informant out of the city. If he\ncould find her. “Hendres thought I tipped off the Dynize, but I didn’t. Any\nidea who did?”\nEmerald shook his head.\n“Maybe it was just bad luck,” Michel grunted.\n“Probably,” Emerald said. “The Dynize have managed to capture or turn\na few Bronze Roses, which compromises safe houses. They’ve also\nincreased their patrols and random searches since the bombing.”\n“So, who is responsible for the bombings?”\n“I’m afraid I haven’t found out yet. There was another this morning—a\ncafé was destroyed when someone lit a fused artillery shell and rolled it\namong a group of Dynize officers. Managed to kill about half of them,\nalong with nine civilians.”\nMichel swore. It was probably some misguided Blackhat cell,\nattempting to use force to scare the Dynize out. It was also stupid; random\nkillings would turn the population against the Blackhats and only serve to\nincrease Dynize aggression. That wasn’t his problem anymore, though.

He swore on the inside. Emerald\nlikely had contacts, escape routes, supplies, safe houses. All of that was\nclosed to Michel, and it annoyed the pit out of him. But he understood why.\n“How the pit are you able to run Taniel’s spy ring from a public morgue?”\nEmerald gave him a coy smile. “I’ve run the Landfall City Morgue for\nover twenty years, under three governments. The occupying administration\ndid the exact same thing Lindet did when she took over the country a\ndecade ago: They saw that I was running a tight ship and left me to my own\ndevices.”\n“That’s it?”\n“Public morgues aren’t so different from sewage systems. People only\nnotice them when they’re run badly. Besides, I’m a widely published\nphysician who’s never had a drop of politics in his writing. I take care of the\nmessy business of bodies and in exchange, the government leaves me to my\nwork. Why should any administration look closer than that?”\nMichel decided not to ask what, exactly, his work entailed. “Hiding in\nplain sight. Intriguing. What can you tell me about the Dynize?”\n“What do you want to know?” Emerald started on the next cut.\n“Who is in charge? Wait, no. Who is in charge of their\ncounterespionage? Who is the one giving out rewards for any Blackhat who\ncomes over to their side?”\nEmerald gave Michel a considering glance, his lips pursed. “You’re not\nthinking about doing something stupid, are you? If the bone-eyes get ahold\nof you …”\n“I know the risks. Right now, I just need to know what I’m up against.”\nEmerald clearly didn’t believe him. “His name is Meln-Yaret. His title\ntranslates to something roughly akin to ‘minister of scrolls.’”\n“Scrolls?”\n“The connotation is probably closer to ‘minister of information.’ I\nhaven’t been able to find out much about him beyond the fact that he exists.\nI have no idea how much power his title actually holds, or where he stands\nin the Dynize hierarchy. He is, apparently, well liked by his underlings.\nOther than that …?” Emerald shrugged.\n“Right.” Michel thought over the archaic-sounding title and tried to\npicture the man who would hold it. In his mind’s eye, this Meln-Yaret\nlooked like a stern librarian or the headmaster of a religious school. Tall,\nwith graying hair and angular features. He realized after a moment that he\nwas picturing a redhead Fidelis Jes. “Anything else you can tell me about\nthe Dynize?”\nEmerald didn’t answer until he’d finished up the next set of stitches.\n“They are very efficient. They are preparing a census of the city to find out"

        "text": "the Dynize?”\nEmerald didn’t answer until he’d finished up the next set of stitches.\n“They are very efficient. They are preparing a census of the city to find out\nhow many people remain and who they are. Their finest minds are studying\nKressian technology. They want to upgrade their gunsmithing and\nmetallurgy to compete with ours, and I suspect that they’ll begin retooling\nLandfall’s factories by the end of summer to upgrade their armies.”\nMichel reeled. “They’re really moving that quickly?”\n“They’ve planned for this,” Emerald said. “I don’t know for how long,\nbut it may be decades. They prepared for Fatrasta’s armies and sorcery and\neven for Lindet. One of the few things they underestimated was the\nmilitary-technology gap. They assumed that rifling and sword bayonets\nwouldn’t play as big of a part as it did. If they eliminate that gap, they\nbelieve the war will be won by the end of next year.”\n“Pit,” Michel breathed.\n“Don’t get me wrong,” Emerald continued. “They’re also almost\nstupidly cocky. Most of their generals believe this war will be over by\nwinter, and then they can take their time figuring out the godstones and\npreparing their armies for anything the Nine decides to throw at them.” He\nfinished one last tug at the stitches. “However, I’m just passing on what\nwhispers I’ve heard. I’m not a military man myself.”\nMichel examined his arm. The stitches felt tight and uncomfortable, but\nthey were as precise as if they’d been done by a machine. “I’m not, either.\nI’ll leave all that to Taniel.”\n“And in the meantime?”\n“In the meantime,” Michel said, thinking of Taniel’s informant, “I have\nmy own tasks to accomplish.” He wondered how quickly he could even find\nthis woman, and if the war would already be lost by then. Strictly speaking,\nthe war wasn’t between the Dynize and Taniel’s faction of Palo. But if\nFatrasta fell, Michel had little doubt that the Dynize would crush any other\nopposition to their rule. The longer Lindet managed to hold out, the longer\nMichel had to accomplish his task. “I appreciate the help,” Michel told\nEmerald. “I need to get out and clear my head.”\nEmerald politely inclined his head. “I hope I was of some use. Just\nremember that in the future …”\n“Only in an emergency.”\n“Precisely.”\nMichel left the morgue, stewing on all this new information, and headed\nto one of the few remaining markets in the city, where he procured wood\nash and vinegar. He returned to his safe house, where he created a mixture\nof the two and let it sit in his hair for part of the afternoon. When he washed\nit out, his hair was a shocking dirty blond. He carefully shaved the stubble\nfrom his face, leaving only a mustache.\nHe practiced holding faces in the mirror, subtly changing the depths of\nhis cheeks and the squint of his eyes until he found something that he could\nkeep up steadily in public.

When he finally looked at the finished\ntransformation, he barely recognized himself.\nHe leaned over the washbasin, staring at himself in the mirror, taking\nseveral long, deep breaths before fetching his shoes. Removing the sole of\nthe left shoe, he produced both his own Gold Rose and the Platinum Rose\nhe took off Fidelis Jes’s body a month ago. He practiced his best confident\nsmile in the mirror.\nWearing a new jacket, he headed for the capitol building.\nHe approached the guards out front, asking several before he found one\nwho spoke passable Palo. “I’m looking for Meln-Yaret,” Michel said. “Can\nI see him?”\n“Only with an appointment.”\n“I understand he wants information.”\n“That is true.”\n“And he’ll pay for it?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good. Take him a message for me. Tell him my name is Michel Bravis,\nand I would like to help him dismantle the Blackhat presence in Landfall.”\nMichel produced the Gold Rose and gave it to the guard. “When you tell\nhim, show him this.”\nCHAPTER 14\nT\nhe Mad Lancers rode hard after splitting with the Riflejacks,\ncircumventing the Fatrastan Army and heading southwest across the\ncountryside. Plantations seemed to stretch forever in every direction, broken\nonly by the slight roll of the land and lines of willow and birch that divided\nthe fields. Every plantation they passed told the same story—laborers\nscurrying in the fields to try to get in an early harvest, while the households\npacked up everything of value and prepared to head toward safety.\nStyke wondered if safety was even an option at this point. Each new\ntown was filled with panicked rumors—that the Dynize had landed on the\nwest, south, and east coasts. That nothing within fifty miles of the ocean\nwas safe from their barbarity. A passing farmer claimed that Swinshire had\nbeen burned to the ground, while a cobbler said that Redstone itself was\nunder siege.\nThe lancers took roads when they could and forged their own paths\nacross the vast plantation fields when they couldn’t. At this point, Styke\nwanted nothing more than speed. They had a thousand men and three times\nas many horses. Subtlety was not an option, and he had an itch between his\nshoulders that told him they were being followed.\nHe called a stop on the afternoon of the third day to let their horses rest\nand graze, regrouping in a field next to one of the thousands of nameless\nroads that crisscrossed Fatrasta.\nStyke leaned on his saddle just off the road, letting Amrec graze without\na harness. Celine lay on her stomach in the grass, feet bare, picking the\nheads off flowers with her toes. Normally, Styke would enjoy watching her\nfoolery for a few quiet minutes, but he found his gaze drawn to the bone-\neye witch wandering among the men and horses.\nKa-poel hadn’t communicated in three days, sticking to herself at the\nback of the column, stopping frequently to scramble in the dust and then\nriding hard to catch up. Sometimes she ranged on ahead with the scouts,\nsniffing the air like a bloodhound, her fingers pressing against the wind as if\ntouching a pane of glass."

Sometimes she ranged on ahead with the scouts,\nsniffing the air like a bloodhound, her fingers pressing against the wind as if\ntouching a pane of glass.\nStyke found himself drawn to her—she was amusing to watch in much\nthe same way as Celine—but he had an inkling that her antics had a much\ndarker purpose than childlike wonder, and he didn’t like it.\n“Have you found me a horse?”\nStyke pulled himself away from watching Ka-poel and turned his\nattention to Celine. “Still looking,” he said. “Anyone catch your eye from\nour reserves?”\nCeline plucked a piece of grass and stuck it between her teeth. “You said\nI can’t have any of the horses that someone is already riding.”\n“Right. Don’t take a man’s horse. Not unless you’ve paid him, killed\nhim, or stolen it fair and square.”\nCeline pouted. “And I can’t steal from our men.”\n“No, you cannot.”\n“Then, no. I haven’t found a horse I like.”\nThe problem, Styke found, was that first-rate horses were rare. Most of\nthe men in his cavalry were riding second-rate horses already, and there\nwasn’t a single first-rate horse left that didn’t have a saddle on it.\nNow, there was nothing wrong with a second-rate horse. They could be\nstrong, fast, smart, dependable, but not all of the above. He wanted Celine\nto have a creature that wouldn’t let her down, one she could bond with.\nHe’d find it one of these days, but not among the horses they had with\nthem.\nUntil then, she’d ride with either him or Sunin.\n“Colonel,” a voice called. Styke looked up to find Zac and Markus\nriding up the column toward him. The two brothers, in addition to their\nnormal rags, tended to ride junk horses that none of his other lancers would\nspare a glance. Perhaps it was part of their scouting disguise, but Styke\ndidn’t understand it himself. A good horse was worth more than any amount\nof blending in.\nStyke nodded to the pair as they approached.\nZac snapped a sloppy salute. “Colonel, we had a question, sir.”\n“What’s that?”\n“Are we heading on a fixed course?”\nStyke cocked an eyebrow. “What do you mean?”\n“This direction we’ve been going. We continuing on for the next few\ndays?”\n“Why?”\nMarkus cleared his throat. “Because, sir, you’re going to miss Bad\nTenny Wiles.”\nStyke perked up. “That’s right. He’s nearby, isn’t he?”\n“Yes, sir. He owns a plantation about forty miles south of here. Big ol’\nbuilding right next to a bend in a stream, surrounded by birches. You know\nthe Cottonseed tributary?”\nStyke pictured a map in his head, considering the location. He nodded.\n“The plantation sits on the land near the spring that feeds the tributary.”\n“Ah. I think I might know the plantation itself. Not far from where we\npicked up Little Gamble during the war?”\n“That’s right.”\nStyke nodded to himself, thoughts turning. “Thanks for that. Where’s\nIbana?”\n“Bit farther back, sir.”"

        "text": "picked up Little Gamble during the war?”\n“That’s right.”\nStyke nodded to himself, thoughts turning. “Thanks for that. Where’s\nIbana?”\n“Bit farther back, sir.”\nStyke headed that direction and soon found Ibana dismounted by an old\nstump. Her warhorse grazed nearby, and she and Jackal bent over a map.\n“Since when do you use a map?” he asked Ibana.\n“It’s been almost six years since I’ve crossed this part of the country,”\nIbana retorted. “I’d like to know what we’re looking at the next few\nhundred miles.”\nStyke couldn’t fault that logic. He shouldered his way in to stand\nbetween them and squinted at the tiny roads and town names. It took a few\nmoments for his eyes to adjust to the way the map was drawn, and he was\nsoon picking out old haunts and prominent landmarks, orienting himself to\ntheir location.\n“We’re here,” Ibana said. She pointed to their location, then drew an\nimaginary line with her finger cutting north of Little Starland and going\nstraight to the Hammer on the west coast of Fatrasta. “Ka-poel says that our\nsearch is going to start somewhere around here. You still want to head\nstraight across the middle of the continent?”\nStyke considered the question. “Jackal, are your spirits telling you\nanything useful?”\n“Hard to keep up a good conversation with the dead while we ride,”\nJackal responded, his voice matter-of-fact. Ibana gave Styke an irritated\nlook, as if to say, Don’t encourage him. She was not, she had made it clear,\na believer in Jackal’s ability to talk to spirits. “However,” Jackal continued,\n“there are a lot of dead coming from the coasts—all the coasts. There’s\nfighting in every direction. Swinshire is almost certainly gone. Maybe Little\nStarland, too.”\n“That’s not good. Are we going to run into any serious enemies?”\nNeither Ibana nor Jackal seemed to know the answer to the question.\nHesitantly, Ibana said, “If the fighting is still on the coasts, then we\nshouldn’t have too much of a problem till we reach the Hammer. We might\nrun into a Fatrastan field army, but they should be pretty preoccupied with\nreaching the front line. I think we’re safe making a beeline to the Hammer.”\nShe tapped on a dot on the map. “Once we reach Belltower, though, things\nwill get tricky. And if Lindet finds out what we’re up to …”\nThe idea did not please Styke. “We’ll just have to keep her in the dark as\nlong as possible. Pit, our own men don’t even know what we’re really up to.\nHow is she going to find out?”\n“Since when has Lindet not known exactly what was going on?” Ibana\ncountered.\n“Right. You remember our talk with Agoston?”\n“I remember cleaning his blood spatter off of my jacket.”\n“Markus and Zac say that Bad Tenny Wiles is about forty miles south of\nour current position.”\nIbana’s eyes narrowed. “You want us to change directions.”\n“Nah. This is something I’m going to handle myself. I want you to keep"

I want you to keep\nheading toward our objective.” He turned his attention back to the map,\nporing over the roads and towns before pointing to one about eighty miles\nto their southwest. “I’ll catch up with you here,” he said. “In a week.\nShouldn’t take longer. If things get hairy, you can keep moving and I’ll find\nyou farther down the road.”\n“All right. Make it quick.”\n“Have you ever known me to linger over a kill?” Styke ended the\nconversation by rolling up the map and handing it to Jackal. He returned to\nAmrec and began to put the saddle back on while Celine still lay in the\ngrass nearby.\n“You’re going to ride with Sunin for the next few days,” Styke told her.\nCeline rolled over, staring at him. “Why?”\n“Because I’ve got an errand to run. I’ll catch up with you later.”\n“Oh?” Celine sat up. “You going to kill someone?”\n“What gives you that idea?”\n“Rumors going around the lancers that you found out about some\ntraitors—the ones who sent you to the firing squad.”\nMarkus and Zac and their damned loose lips. Styke swore under his\nbreath. “Yeah,” he answered half-heartedly. “I’m going to kill someone.”\n“I want to come.”\n“You can’t.”\n“You took me into battle, but you won’t take me to kill one man?”\nStyke finished with the buckles and ran his hand along Amrec’s flank,\nthen patted him on the nose. He thought through a dozen reasons why this\nwas different, knowing that Celine would fight him about each one.\nTruthfully, he could move quicker and quieter without her. On the other\nhand, she was his responsibility. Handing her to Sunin every time he\nwanted her out of the way felt a lot like how his father had treated him as a\nboy.\nThe thought caused a sour feeling in Styke’s stomach.\n“Fine,” he said. “Let’s go.”\nThey slipped away from the lancers and turned south, quickly putting a\nhill between them and the cavalry. Styke preferred to be away before\nanyone noticed, and back before anyone had the courage to ask Ibana\nquestions, and they were almost a mile down the road before a horse caught\nup with them at a gallop.\nIt was Ka-poel. She put her horse in front of Amrec, forcing Styke to\npull on the reins.\nHer hands moved in a quick, demanding flurry. He could guess what she\nwanted to know, but instead he just sighed. “I have no idea what you’re\nsaying.”\nKa-poel snorted at him. She produced a piece of slate, like children in a\nschoolhouse might use to practice sums, and wrote out a sentence, showing\nit to him. Where are you going?\n“Business,” Styke said. “I’ll meet up with you again next week. Stay\nwith Ibana and the lancers.”\nNo.\n“What do you mean?”\nI’m coming, Ka-poel scribbled.\nStyke looked down at Celine. “What is this? Are the two of you in"

I’ve got work to do, and I can’t protect you by myself. Stay with\nthe lancers.”\nI don’t need a bodyguard.\n“Damn it.” Styke rubbed his eyes, wishing she’d just turn around and go\naway. She made him uneasy at best, and he needed his mind clear for this.\nHaving Celine along was already trying enough. “Ibana thinks you’re with\nher.”\nI told her I’m going with you.\n“I don’t take orders from you, girl,” Styke warned.\nMost people shied away when Styke became visibly annoyed. Ka-poel\njust smiled at him coldly. She wrote, I ride with you or I follow. Choose.\nStyke stared at her for a few moments, then ran his hand through his\nhair. “Have it your way. Let’s move.”\nCHAPTER 15\nM\nichel waited just inside the capitol building for nearly an hour, trying to\nlook nonchalant under the watchful eye of three Dynize soldiers. He found\na blank piece of paper in one of his pockets and practiced folding it into\nvarious shapes, holding each one up for the purview of his silent guards.\nThey continued to watch, unmoving, unresponsive, though Michel swore\nthat he saw a hint of bemusement in the eyes of one of them.\nHis patience was finally rewarded by the arrival of a middle-aged\nwoman wearing a soldier’s uniform without the customary Dynize\nbreastplate. She had fire-red hair and a gentle face that Michel immediately\nassociated with an indulgent governess. She was unarmed, and her\nturquoise uniform was adorned with the stylized symbol of a dagger poised\nabove a cup just above her heart. Crow’s feathers dangled from her\nearrings.\nWhen she arrived, Michel’s guards seemed to stiffen, and she examined\nMichel with a detached, unimpressed gaze. “You are the one who brought\nthe Rose?” she asked in passable Palo.\n“I am.”\n“Follow me.”\nMichel glanced over his shoulder toward the door, trying not to let his\nmisgivings get the best of him. This was probably a terrible idea. He didn’t\nknow the Dynize—not their hierarchy or customs or laws. He didn’t know\nhow to navigate their world, and he was stepping in blind hoping that this\nMeln-Yaret was smart enough to see the value in Michel’s willing\ncooperation.\nAfter a few more seconds of hesitation, he followed the woman down\nthe hall.\nThey walked side by side past rows of offices. They passed soldiers and\nbureaucrats, officers and errand boys. It was a strange sight, seeing\nredheads—whom Michel had so long associated only with the Palo—in the\ngovernment offices, but other than that change everything looked much the\nsame as it did before the occupation. If there had been any particular chaos\nhere after Lindet fled, it had long since been cleaned up, and it appeared\nthat no damage had been done during the fighting.\nThe woman led him down the first flight of stairs and past several turns,\nthen a whole other set of stairs down into the bowels of the building.

Michel\nbegan to grow concerned as they left daylight behind and now had to\ndepend on gas lanterns, and was about to ask their destination when the\nwoman stopped and opened a door, indicating with a gentle smile that\nMichel should step inside.\n“I want to see Meln-Yaret,” Michel said.\n“I know.”\n“Will I?”\n“Please.” She gestured to the door once more, and Michel cautiously\nstepped into the doorway. The room inside was lit by a single lamp. It was\nsmall, almost claustrophobic, and it had a drain in the center of the floor.\n“Look,” Michel said, “I—” He was suddenly driven to his knees, a pain\nerupting from his left shoulder. His entire left arm went numb, his vision\nspotty, and he gasped out loud as he fell. He turned, attempting to scramble\naway—and farther into the dank room—only to see the woman standing\nabove him with a blackjack held casually in one hand and a wan smile on\nher face. “Wha …?” Michel tried to ask.\nThe woman lashed out at his chest with one foot, connecting painfully,\nand Michel tried to retreat farther, only to come up against the wall. He\ntried to yell or speak, but all that came out was a breathless whimper.\nShe came at him with the blackjack, and he raised his numb left arm,\nonly to remember too late that it was the same arm that Emerald had\nstitched mere hours ago. The blow landed hard, causing him to gasp once\nmore. He dug into his pocket with his right hand, but had left his knuckle-\ndusters back at the safe house. When she drew back to kick him again, he\nmoved to one side to cause a glancing blow, then attempted to tackle her by\nthe legs.\nThe woman stumbled, nearly fell, then almost casually swatted Michel\njust above the ear with the blackjack. It wasn’t even a hard blow, but Michel\nsaw darkness for several seconds before his vision returned, and a\nhorrifying pain shot through his head. He let go of her legs, wrapping his\narms around his head, and attempted to curl into a ball to await the next\nblow.\n“Devin-Forgula!” a man’s voice barked.\nThe next blow never came. Michel hazarded a glance through blurry\nvision. He saw the woman standing over him, turned toward the hallway,\nwhere two men had appeared. One of them was young—probably about\nMichel’s age, in his midtwenties—and had a bald head and a short, lean\nframe. This one stared at the woman with outright antagonism. The second\nman was old, probably in his forties, with a beer belly and two fingers\nmissing on his right hand.\nThe older man spoke, and it was obvious it was he who’d called out the\nname. “Devin-Forgula,” he said again, his voice quiet but reprimanding.\n“Get out.” The words were in Dynize, but close enough to their Palo\ncounterparts that Michel understood.\nThe woman answered too quickly for Michel to follow.\n“Get out,” the older man repeated."

The older man watched\nForgula go, then gave an exasperated sigh and stepped into the room. He\nbent over Michel, pulling Michel’s arm gently but firmly out of the way and\nexamining the side of his head. “His head is bleeding,” he said in Palo.\n“And his arm. Can you stand?” The question was directed at Michel, but it\ntook his addled brain a moment to register it. Slowly, he crawled to his\nknees and then, with the help of the younger man, up to his feet.\nHe limped after the two men. Neither helped him when he moved slowly\non the stairs, but they did not hurry him, either. They headed to the next\nfloor, where they found an empty room. They were still in the basement of\nthe capitol building, but natural light came in through a high window and\nthere was a rug and chairs here—probably the office of a low-level\nbureaucrat under Lindet’s regime.\nMichel sat in one chair, head in his hands, watching blood drip from his\narm onto the rug. He felt the eyes of both his new companions but did not\nlook up at them. He was doing all he could not to throw up.\n“Forgula says that you are a Blackhat spy,” the older man said. “Is that\ntrue?”\n“I was,” Michel responded, stressing the second word.\n“But no more?”\n“I … understand that you are offering rewards and amnesty to Blackhats\nwho switch sides.”\n“Switch sides.” The man laughed. “That’s one way of putting it. Yes,\nthat is the offer.”\n“That woman—”\n“Forgula is not a member of my Household,” the man said, his tone\nshifting to anger. “She serves another master—one who believes that\nenemies should be slaughtered rather than turned into allies. Someone told\nher about this little trinket, and she decided to take matters into her own\nhands before I could respond.”\nMichel finally looked up to find the older man holding his Gold Rose,\nturning it in his fingers to examine the details in the light. “You’re Meln-\nYaret?” Michel asked.\n“I am.” The man smiled, and Michel could see that it was both tired and\ngenuine—the smile of, as Silver Rose Blasdell used to say, a man who had\nto work for a living. “I apologize for letting Forgula get her claws into you.\nThat had to have been”—he eyed Michel’s arm—“unpleasant.”\n“That’s one way of putting it.”\nMeln-Yaret gave a bemused snort. “Forgive me,” he said, gesturing to\nhis younger companion. “This is Devin-Tenik.

        "text": "Michel took a longer look at Devin-Tenik, his eyes finally starting to clear,\nand realized something strange: Devin-Tenik didn’t have the subtle facial\nmarkers that differentiated the Dynize from the Palo. His face was softer,\nhis eyebrows farther apart, and his chin slightly weaker. If he hadn’t been\nwearing a turquoise uniform, Michel would have immediately assumed he\nwas a Palo. “What do you think of our new friend, Tenik?” Meln-Yaret\nasked.\n“He admits he is a spy.” Tenik had a startlingly deep voice that belied his\nslim, short stature.\n“He admits he was a spy.”\n“Once a spy, always a spy.”\n“Perhaps.”\nMichel squeezed his eyes closed. The pain in his head was a dull throb\nnow, which was only slightly easier to think through than the sharp pain\nfrom earlier. He knew that there were layers to this meeting—Forgula,\nTenik, Meln-Yaret, Households, and cupbearers. There was more going on\nthan was immediately apparent, but in his current state he could not guess\nwhat it was. “I was a Blackhat spy,” he said. “Before the invasion, I was\nelevated to Gold Rose, which is the highest order within the Blackhats. The\ninvasion came, the Grand Master was murdered, and then Lindet fled the\ncity without warning.”\n“And now …” Meln-Yaret made a tutting sound. “What did you tell the\nsoldier to whom you gave this Rose? That you would hand me the\nBlackhats within Landfall?”\n“That’s right. I can help you dismantle their efforts here.”\nMeln-Yaret nodded. “You certainly have my attention. Let us start with\nthis: What can you offer me, and what do you want in return?”\nMichel forced himself to sit up straight, looking Meln-Yaret in the eye.\nThis was now a negotiation, and he couldn’t conduct a negotiation from a\npoint of such weakness. He needed to appear strong, even if that appearance\nwas obviously a sham. “I can offer you the locations of caches and safe\nhouses. I can help you track down Blackhats who have remained in the city.\nI can tell you how they work and how they think. I’ll admit that I wasn’t a\nGold Rose long, but I spent years as a Silver Rose. I saw far more than the\naverage Blackhat.”\n“And what reward do you expect for your aid?”\n“People.”\n“What do you mean, people?” Tenik cut in. “Slaves?”\nThe casual way Tenik said the word reminded Michel how foreign the\nDynize still were. He shook his head. “Not slaves.” This was something\nhe’d thought about a lot since the occupation.“You’ve been rounding up\nFatrastan citizens, the families of Blackhats who left the city with Lindet.\nIt’s part of war, I understand. But those people were abandoned by their\ngovernment and their loved ones. They don’t deserve to be hunted, tortured,\nand forced into labor camps or worse. In exchange for my help, I want you\nto let those people go.”\nMeln-Yaret leaned back in his chair, thoughtfully stroking his chin. He\nglanced at Tenik. “You don’t want riches?

Riches …” Michel allowed himself a\nsmile. “I intend on proving myself very useful to the Dynize government.\nThe riches can come later. For now, I want those people released.”\n“You ask too much,” Tenik said bluntly.\nMeln-Yaret held up a hand to silence his companion. “It’s true, you ask a\ngreat deal. We gather these people because they themselves may be spies,\nbut they are also useful as hostages and forced labor. We have hundreds\nalready, and I imagine we’ll end up with a few thousand by the end of the\nyear, even without your help.”\n“Probably,” Michel admitted, “but the hostages themselves have little\nvalue. The spouses and children of low-level Blackhats? Lindet doesn’t care\nabout them. Eject them from your territory. Hand them over to the closest\nFatrastan army. Let them be a hindrance to your enemies and disguise it as\nan act of goodwill. There are already rumors that you’re treating the Palo\nbetter than Lindet ever did. The people might begin to see you as a\nbenevolent conqueror. If this war draws on, that itself will be a dangerous\nweapon.”\nMeln-Yaret smirked. “You make a very persuasive argument, Michel\nBravis. But what you ask … it would be very difficult.”\nMichel gingerly touched the side of his head. It hadn’t occurred to him\nthat the minister of scrolls might not actually be that powerful of a position.\nIf Meln-Yaret was simply a hound used to find enemy spies rather than a\nspymaster in his own right, Michel may have badly misplaced his bets. He\nneeded a powerful patron if he was going to find Taniel’s informant.\n“On the other hand,” Meln-Yaret continued after a moment’s silence, “I\nmay be able to work with your demands. Tell me, why should I trust you?\nYou’ve already admitted to being a spy. Shouldn’t I assume you’re still\nworking for the Fatrastans? This could simply be your way to get into my\ngood graces.”\nThere was a glint in Meln-Yaret’s eyes that Michel didn’t particularly\nlike. He swallowed, holding Yaret’s gaze. “Give me the chance to earn that\ntrust.”\n“Why? Why shouldn’t I just torture you for your information? Or hand\nyou over to the bone-eyes?”\nMichel tried not to let his fear show at the mention of bone-eyes. He\nknew what a bone-eye was capable of, but that information was something\nhe didn’t want to let on. “Because I came to you in good faith. You offer a\nreward for service. Is this the reward of which you speak? Because if it is,\nword will get out sooner or later. Even sympathizers will grow wary of you,\nand rumors will spread that the Dynize ministers are not true to their word.”\nYaret exchanged a glance with Tenik, tongue in cheek.\n“He has balls,” Tenik said with a shrug. “But he’s still a spy. What good\nis goodwill if it is used against us?”\n“Goodwill is a double-edged sword,” Yaret admitted.\nMichel leaned forward, ignoring the blood dripping from his chin. “Do I"

        "text": "is goodwill if it is used against us?”\n“Goodwill is a double-edged sword,” Yaret admitted.\nMichel leaned forward, ignoring the blood dripping from his chin. “Do I\nseem like someone who would be more useful as a willing participant, or\nforced to aid you under duress?”\nMeln-Yaret did not answer the question. “Can you tell me where Lindet\nkeeps her personal files?”\nThe question caught Michel off guard. “I can’t.”\n“Can you tell me where the gunsmiths fled, so that we might capture\nthem and use their expertise to improve our armies?”\n“I can’t,” Michel answered again. For all his bravado, he knew he was\non shaky ground. Meln-Yaret obviously had goals. If Michel couldn’t help\nhim with those, then Meln-Yaret might just hand him off to someone else.\nSomeone like Forgula.\nWith each answer, Meln-Yaret looked increasingly doubtful. He sighed,\nshaking his head. “Caches and safe houses are not enough. You’re asking\nme to put a lot of trust in you, and in return all I receive are promises. Give\nme something, Michel, and we can begin a relationship. Until then …”\nMeln-Yaret trailed off.\nMichel wracked his brain. His bluster about seeing a lot as a spy had\nbeen mostly that—bluster. He certainly knew some secrets, and he had no\ndoubt that he could be useful to the Dynize in the long term. But immediate\nevidence of his good intentions? His eyes fell on the Gold Rose as Meln-\nYaret turned it over and over again between his fingers.\n“Tell me,” Michel said, “did Lindet destroy the third floor of the\nBlackhat Archives when she left?”\nMeln-Yaret stopped twirling the Gold Rose and looked up sharply.\nMichel had hit upon something. “She did not.”\n“Do you know what’s up there?”\n“We have … an inkling.”\n“Secrets. A lot of them. I assume it’s heavily warded. It will take your\nPrivileged months, if not years, to break into it without destroying the\ncontents. You want goodwill? You want trust?” Michel took a fraction of a\nsecond to study Yaret. His expressions and composure reminded him once\nmore of Captain Blasdell, and Michel decided to take a gamble. “The Gold\nRose is a key,” he said simply. “It’ll open the gate to the third floor. It\nworked for me. I don’t see why it wouldn’t work for you.” He silently\nprayed that Lindet’s Privileged hadn’t had time to change the wards before\nthey fled the city.\nMeln-Yaret looked down at the Rose in his hand. “Well. As simple as\nthat?”\n“As simple as that.”\nThe two Dynize exchanged a glance, and Meln-Yaret addressed Tenik\nwith a clever smile. “Sedial will be furious. All right, Michel. Assuming this\nworks, I will put you on a leash and let you go to work. You’ll have\nfreedom of movement, a Household, protection, and the backing of my\nname. I’ll see what I can do about the families that we have rounded up.\nThe more results you get me, the more likely I’ll be able to free\nnoncombatants.”"

        "text": "name. I’ll see what I can do about the families that we have rounded up.\nThe more results you get me, the more likely I’ll be able to free\nnoncombatants.”\nAs simple as that. Michel barely allowed himself to breathe. “Is there\nanywhere you want me to start?”\n“There is. I have several hundred men combing the city to find out\nwho’s responsible for the recent bombings. We’ve captured countless\nBlackhats and partisans, and not a single person can tell me who carried out\nor ordered them. A Household Captain of the Guard was killed less than an\nhour ago, and it has the ministers nervous.”\n“I’m not an investigator,” Michel warned. “If it’s not the Blackhats, I\nwon’t be able to help you.”\n“Then rule them out,” Yaret responded.\nMichel hesitated. He already suspected that the perpetrators were a\nBlackhat cell, but he didn’t have the slightest idea where they were holed up\nor who they were led by. Perhaps the mysterious Gold Rose? Regardless, he\nhad to say yes. Michel needed to gain stature within the Dynize as quickly\nas possible—lengthen that leash and get to know the Dynize officials. The\nmore he infiltrated their government, the more likely he was to find Taniel’s\ninformant.\n“I’ll see what I can do,” Michel promised.\nCHAPTER 16\nI\ns spying always this boring?” Tenik asked.\nMichel stood at a window in a stuffy tenement room in the industrial\nquarter of Lower Landfall. He gazed through a slit in the curtains, watching\nthe entrance of a tenement across the street while he listened to the sound of\nthe midafternoon traffic. Before the war, this whole district was choked\nwith smoke and the sound of carts, people, and factories. Now it was almost\nquiet with the factories empty and the traffic sparse.\nMichel turned away from the window just long enough to glance at the\nman sitting in the corner behind him. Devin-Tenik looked even more like a\nPalo once he had shed his turquoise uniform for a brown cotton suit and\nflatcap, and he lounged on the floor as if it were more comfortable there\nthan in a chair. Michel answered the question, “Most of being a spy is\nwaiting, watching, and listening. So yes, it’s always this boring.”\nTenik flipped a coin in the air and caught it. He slapped it on the back of\nhis wrist but didn’t bother looking at the result before flipping it again. He’d\nbeen doing so for about four hours, and Michel wasn’t sure whether to\nstrangle him or find something to take his own mind off the tedium.\n“Are you supposed to follow me everywhere?” Michel asked.\nTenik smiled. “That’s the idea. Your Gold Rose opened the third floor of\nthe Millinery. You have earned Yaret’s trust, and you are now part of his\nHousehold. But you’re still a foreigner. For your safety, I am to be your\nbodyguard, guide, and assistant.”\n“Bodyguard, eh?” Michel muttered. Tenik didn’t appear to be a soldier,\nbut he was lean and fit and walked with the confidence of someone who\nknew how to handle a fight.

Michel suspected that his job was less\n“bodyguard” and more “guard.” Michel wondered how long it would take\nfor him to become fully trusted. Years, perhaps. He didn’t have that much\ntime. Until then, he could make use of an assistant and guide.\n“What do you mean when you say ‘part of Yaret’s Household’?”\n“Dynize society is based around Households,” Tenik explained. “A\nHousehold revolves around a Name.” He flipped his coin, caught it, and\npointed a finger at Michel. “You are the newest member of Yaret’s\nHousehold.”\n“Yaret is the Name of the Household?” Michel asked. He kept his\nattention on the road and the entrance to the tenement across the street, but\nhe listened carefully. He suspected that much of his downtime the next few\nweeks would be spent learning about Dynize society. He needed to enter\nand climb it as quickly as possible.\n“It is. Ah!” Tenik felt around in his jacket pockets for a moment, then\nwithdrew a card and handed it to Michel. “This belongs to you. It marks\nyou as a member of Yaret’s Household and entitled to the protection of\nYaret’s Name. If we are ever separated and you are questioned by soldiers,\nyou can show them this and they will escort you to Yaret’s home.”\nMichel took the card and turned it over in his hand. It was on a heavy\nstock, coated in wax and decorated with a stylized golden trim. There were\nwords in Dynize at the bottom and a red thumbprint in the center. He\nimmediately wondered how hard it would be to counterfeit. If he’d gotten\nhold of one of these as a Blackhat, doing so would be his first concern.\n“Handy,” he said.\n“It is, but you should be careful.”\nMichel glanced at Tenik sharply. “Of?”\n“Remember Forgula? She belongs to a rival Household. Yaret’s\nprotection is meant to be sacred, but in reality it is only as good as the\npower of his Name. Forgula attempted to snatch you out from under us, and\nit’s possible that she will do so again if she thinks it’s worth angering\nYaret.”\n“Her Household Name is stronger than Yaret’s?”\n“Her Household is stronger than everyone’s.”\n“And whose is that?”\n“Sedial.” Tenik’s expression darkened. “Ka-Sedial is the emperor’s\nappointed ruler on this continent. Be wary of him. Be wary of the bone-\neyes.”\n“Why?”\n“I …” Tenik hesitated, as if remembering that he was talking to someone\nhe shouldn’t completely trust. “Just be wary of them. Prove yourself to\nYaret and in return you’ll be taught all you need to know to be a useful\nmember of his Household.”\nMichel was surprised to receive such a warning from a Dynize. They\nseemed so organized and in-step that he had expected the division among\nthem to be minimal. Household rivalries sounded like something he could\nuse. He would have to learn more about them.\n“Do people ever change Households?” he asked.\nTenik’s penetrating stare told Michel a great deal. After a moment, Tenik"

After a moment, Tenik\nanswered, “All the time. Marriages. Trades. Formal requests. Both\nHousehold Names must agree for it to be done formally.”\n“And informally?”\nTenik’s expression softened and he resumed flipping his coin, as if\ncarefree, but there was a glint in his eye. “Concern yourself with finding\nthis Gold Rose you promised your new master.”\nMichel slowly turned back to the curtain. “Right.”\nA few minutes later he heard Tenik get up and cross the room, coming to\nstand just behind Michel and craning his neck to look outside. Michel\nstepped to one side, allowing him the view.\nTenik asked, “How does starting here help you find the person\nresponsible for the bombings?”\n“I thought you worked for the minister of scrolls,” Michel responded,\npulling away to get a good look at Tenik’s face.\n“I do. What of it?”\n“And you don’t know anything about being a spy?”\nTenik let out a soft laugh. “You think Yaret is some kind of spy?”\n“That …” Michel hesitated, thinking of his conversation with Emerald.\n“That’s what I was led to believe. Well, not a spy himself. But a spymaster.”\n“I don’t know that word.”\nTenik knew far more Adran and Palo than Michel had expected, and\ntheir conversations took place in both those languages as well as Dynize.\nMichel tried to think of a Palo word for “spymaster,” but settled on “one\nwho commands those who watch your enemies.”\n“Ah, I see,” Tenik said. “Yes, I suppose that works. The minister of\nscrolls traditionally oversees government information—history, census data,\nthat sort of thing—but Yaret wanted to be involved in the invasion. He\nworked to expand his position so that Sedial didn’t have complete control of\nthe war.”\nCensus data could be useful, if it included the names of Dynize citizens\nhere in Fatrasta. “The emperor doesn’t have a designated spymaster?”\n“I believe he does,” Tenik recalled, “but they only oversee threats\nagainst the emperor’s person. Government spies were purged after the end\nof the civil war, and we needed something new when we turned our eyes\noutward.”\nMichel considered the information. He had a thousand questions about\nthe things he was just told, but he couldn’t risk being too curious. He\nneeded to pick his questions carefully. For now, it was enough to know that\nYaret was more akin to a record keeper than a spymaster. Shrewd, perhaps,\nbut not seasoned. “So what are you? A census taker?”\n“No, no,” Tenik said, “I am one of Yaret’s cupbearers.”\nThe term sounded archaic, and it was not the first time Michel had heard\na Dynize use it. He seemed to remember that it was an honorarium in the\ncourt of Kressian kings. “I’m not familiar with the term. What is your\nrole?”\n“I have no role—and I have every role,” Tenik said, spreading his arms.\n“A cupbearer is a trusted member of the Household who takes on whatever"

I have been many things. For now, I am your\nbodyguard and assistant.”\n“It’s an honored position?”\n“Very.”\n“Looking after me seems … beneath you.”\n“Not at all. You were a high-ranking member of the Blackhats. Your\nplace within the Household has yet to be determined, but you are not a\nslave.” He paused. “No, what is the word for the lowliest member?” He said\nsomething in Dynize, then “commoner? Is that the word?”\n“I think I get your meaning,” Michel said.\n“Good. By the way, you never answered my question.”\n“Which one?”\n“How does this help us catch the culprit behind the bombings?”\nMichel pulled himself away from his myriad of questions and nodded to\nthe tenement across the street. “I’m waiting for someone.”\n“Who?”\n“A woman named Hendres. We worked together for a brief time after the\nwar started.”\n“How will she be useful?”\n“Because she knows that I turned. I’m willing to bet that with me gone,\nshe will have spent the last couple of days tracking down the highest-\nranking Blackhat in the city. With any luck, it’s a Gold Rose who, if not\npersonally responsible for the bombings, will probably have a good idea\nwho is.”\n“You were friends with this Hendres woman?”\nMichel decided not to mention their time as lovers. “Partners. We were\ntrying to figure out how to save the families of Blackhats from your\npurges.”\n“And why did you stop being partners?”\n“Because I decided that joining you was more efficient.” Michel didn’t\nmuch like this line of questioning, and hoped that it came across in his\nvoice.\nTenik didn’t seem to notice. “How do you know she’ll come here?”\n“I don’t,” Michel said. A glance at Tenik’s face revealed the other’s\nskepticism, and he continued. “Hendres isn’t a spy. She was an enforcer,\nthen a bureaucrat. Everything she knows about sneaking around she learned\nfrom me in the last month.”\n“And?”\n“And we worked from the same list of safe houses. The safe house\nacross the street is one of the few we never discussed using as a backup.\nHendres is smart enough to have ditched our backup safe houses and will\nonly use those she thinks I’m less likely to search. If she doesn’t show up at\nthis one tonight, we’ll check one of the others tomorrow.”\nMichel gave the explanation offhand, and it didn’t occur to him until\nhe’d finished speaking what, exactly, he’d just revealed. He risked a quick\nglance at Tenik, whose eyes were still focused on the street. He was just\nbeginning to think Tenik hadn’t noticed the slip, when Tenik asked, “How\ndoes Hendres know that you’re working for us?” The question was posed in\na quiet, thoughtful tone.\nMichel licked his lips. “It’s complicated.”\n“I think I could follow an explanation.”\nMichel grew even more cognizant of the fact that Tenik had been sent to\nkeep an eye on him.

        "text": "“I think I could follow an explanation.”\nMichel grew even more cognizant of the fact that Tenik had been sent to\nkeep an eye on him. Everything he shared with Tenik would be revealed to\nYaret, and might affect Michel’s standing. Carelessly giving away\ninformation, he decided, would be a stupid way to end his short stint with\nthe Dynize.\n“Hendres accused me of being a spy for the Dynize,” Michel said. “She\ntried to kill me.”\n“You became a traitor because you were falsely accused of being a\ntraitor?”\nMichel didn’t like the word “traitor.” It ignored the complexities of what\nbeing a spy actually meant. “Yes,” he said.\n“And why did she think you were a traitor?”\n“Because one of our safe houses was raided by Dynize soldiers while I\nwas away. She barely escaped, and only the two of us knew about the safe\nhouse.” It was close enough to the truth for Michel. He added a twist of\nanger to his words—also real—and clicked his tongue. “Speaking of which,\ndo you see that woman with the brown hair down at the end of the street?”\n“I do.”\n“That’s her.”\nMichel took a deep breath to calm himself as he watched Hendres mill\nabout the intersection at the end of the street, checking subtly for a possible\nambush. Her body language was tense and she checked the street, rooftops,\nand tenement doorway several times before finally coming down the street\nand heading inside. It seemed she was still spooked from coming back to\nthe Dynize stakeout last week.\n“She didn’t see us,” Tenik observed.\n“She didn’t check the windows at all,” Michel said. “She really needs to\nlearn to do that.”\n“What next?”\n“You don’t have to whisper,” Michel responded. “Even if she was still in\nthe street, she wouldn’t hear us.”\nTenik cleared his throat and his cheeks flushed. “So what next?” he\nasked in a normal voice.\n“Now we wait.”\nTenik rolled his eyes and returned to the corner of the room, slumping\ndown on the floor. The familiar flicking sound of him flipping a coin soon\nbegan. Michel waited, nearly stepping back from the window when he saw\na curtain flutter in Hendres’s safe-house room.\n“Now we know where she’s staying,” Michel said over his shoulder.\n“We can come back tomorrow morning and wait until she goes out, and\nthen …” He paused as Hendres suddenly appeared in the tenement\ndoorway. “Shit, never mind. Come with me, now!”\nMichel left the room at a run, heading down the hallway without waiting\nto see if Tenik had followed him. He went up two floors, then climbed out\nthe window of an abandoned apartment and around the ledge, then hiked\nhimself up onto the roof. He crossed it in a few moments and crouched\ndown, searching the traffic below.\nIt wasn’t long until he spotted Hendres heading north. He heard a clatter\nbehind him, and Tenik joined him a moment later with a string of words in\nDynize that were definitely curses.\n“Come on,” Michel told him, heading to the other side of the roof and\nquickly climbing down the chimney sweep’s ladder.

He caught up to\nHendres a few blocks later, falling into step a hundred paces back and\npulling his hat down over his face. He indicated that Tenik do the same.\n“The trick to following someone,” Michel explained in a low voice, “is\nto stay far enough away that they won’t suspect you’re on their tail—but\nclose enough that you won’t lose them when they inevitably turn corners or\ngo into buildings.”\n“What happens when they go into buildings?”\n“Depends. If you’re trying to catch them, you make sure it’s not a trap,\nthen set your own. It helps to have some thugs with you.”\n“And if you’re not trying to catch them?”\n“Then you wait until they come out again.”\nTenik groaned.\n“Hold up,” Michel said, turning to face a shop window as Hendres\nstopped at an intersection and checked behind her. He watched her out of\nthe corner of his eye while pretending to study a hat, then turned to follow\nher again once she’d kept going. “I dyed my hair after I last saw her,”\nMichel explained. “It won’t hold up to a close examination, but it’s enough\nto fool her at a distance.”\n“Is she that stupid?”\n“People are that stupid,” Michel responded. “You’d be surprised at what\neven a cautious person will overlook.”\nThey soon left the industrial quarter, and passed the old dockside market\nand the ruins of the eastern face of the plateau. Out in the harbor, Fort Nied\nsat pitted and forlorn, mostly ignored by the occupying force. Hendres\ncrossed the river and rounded the plateau to head into the northern suburbs.\nShe stopped at two different buildings, both times briefly, before\ncontinuing her journey. One of the stops was at the bar of a known Blackhat\ncontact, and the second was unfamiliar to Michel. He tried to put himself in\nher shoes, working through her route, trying to figure out what she was\ndoing.\n“How do we know when we’ve followed her to the right place?” Tenik\nasked quietly while they waited for her outside yet a third stop.\n“We don’t,” Michel responded. “It might be obvious, or we might have\nto stake out all of these places.”\n“We’re trying to find this other Gold Rose?”\n“Exactly. If we’re lucky, she’ll have already made contact with him\nsince my departure and she’ll lead us right to him.”\n“If we’re unlucky?”\n“If we’re unlucky, she’s spotted us and is leading us into a trap.” With\nthose words, Michel double-checked his pocket to make sure his knuckle-\ndusters were still there. They were. He didn’t want to be caught unawares\nagain like he had with Forgula.\nHe stopped at an intersection to wait for a column of Dynize soldiers to\nwalk by, tipping his hat to them. Tenik gave him a questioning look.\n“Force of habit,” Michel said. “You’re less likely to notice someone with\ngood manners. Not great manners, mind you. Just good ones.” The column\npassed by and he swore under his breath.\n“I don’t see her,” Tenik said."

Head down, keep walking. Watch to your right out of\nthe corner of your eye. I’ll watch the left.”\nThey continued straight down the street past a row of shops, half of\nwhich were boarded up. This was a residential area, lower middle class, and\nhad maintained much of its population after the evacuation. No one paid\nthem any mind, and after they’d gone two blocks Michel whispered to\nTenik to turn around.\nThey did a second sweep, coming up with nothing.\n“She’s got to be in one of these buildings,” Michel said. “But the longer\nwe linger, the more chance she’ll look out a window and notice us standing\naround. Over here.” Michel headed into a nearby bakery, following his nose\ninto the front of the shop where hot loaves had just come out of the oven.\n“Don’t stand out,” he said quietly. “Buy something.”\nTenik went up to the counter while Michel turned to watch out the front\nwindow.\n“We don’t take those,” a voice said loudly.\nMichel turned to find Tenik offering the baker a Dynize rations card.\nTenik opened his mouth, but Michel stepped in to intercede, handing over a\ncouple of Fatrastan coins. He thanked the baker and pulled Tenik back\noutside, where he tore the loaf in half.\nTenik scowled back at the door. “These are valid,” he said, shaking the\nrations card under Michel’s nose. “The government has ordered that all\nbusinesses accept them.”\n“Don’t worry too much about it,” Michel said, bemused by Tenik’s\nindignation. “You look like a Palo and dress like a Palo. They’re going to\ntreat you like one. Which means they won’t let you pay with a currency that\nmight not be any good in a few months.”\n“He thinks Dynize will lose the war?” Tenik looked like he was ready to\nmarch back inside. Michel took him by the arm and led him away.\n“Hedging his bets, probably. Like I said, don’t worry about …” Michel\ntrailed off as he spotted someone over Tenik’s shoulder. “Don’t turn\naround,” he said in a low voice, lifting his half a loaf of bread up to his face\nbut keeping his eyes fixed down the street. “Loosen up,” he told Tenik.\n“Your shoulders are hunched and your body tense. That’s going to be\nobvious to anyone who knows what to look for. Now, I see Hendres just\nover your left shoulder. She just came out of that alleyway next to the\ncobbler’s. We’re going to stay here until she moves again. If I say turn, I\nwant you to casually look at that playbill plastered on the wall to your left.\nUnderstand?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good.” Michel watched for several moments as Hendres spoke with\nsomeone just around the corner.

Slowly, casually, he swept his gaze back across\nthat alley Hendres had been standing in a moment ago. A man had emerged\nto chat with one of the shopkeeps, smoking a cigarette carelessly.\n“She’s getting away!”\n“Forget about her,” Michel said. “We got lucky. Damned lucky.”\n“How?”\nMichel took Tenik by the arm and led him down a nearby alley without\nanswering the question.\n“Where are we going?” Tenik asked.\n“To find a lookout spot. The man who Hendres just met with is named\nMarhoush. He’s a Silver Rose, and he’s the right-hand man of Val je Tura.\nNot only is je Tura Lindet’s personal enforcer, but he also spent most of the\nFatrastan revolution killing Kez soldiers and civilians with explosives. I’m\nwilling to bet je Tura is the one bombing your soldiers, and Marhoush will\nlead us right to him.”\nCHAPTER 17\nS\ntyke, Celine, and Ka-poel rode for three days in near silence, broken only\nby Celine’s occasional questions about the people and horses they passed on\nthe road. They traveled against the flow of traffic as thousands of refugees\nleft their homes and businesses and fled northwest in an attempt to stay\nahead of the Dynize invaders.\nStories traveled with them: a thousand rumors that painted the Dynize as\neverything from blood-drinking monsters who snatched away Kressian\nyouths, to liberators who brought with them freedom from the oppressive\nrule of Lindet and her Blackhats. Regardless of which rumor was carried by\nthe passing travelers, everyone seemed to prefer taking their chances with\nthe evil they knew—Lindet—rather than the evil they did not.\nBy the third day, Styke found the spring that gave birth to the\nCottonseed tributary, a small river that meandered between plantation fields\nfor about thirty miles, growing bigger until it joined the Cottonseed River\nand eventually poured into the Hadshaw. Styke stopped at the spring,\nwashing the road dust off his face and instructing Celine to do the same\nbefore making sure his carbines were loaded and his knife was sharp. After\na brief lunch, he lifted Celine back into the saddle and followed the banks\nof the tributary.\n“What are we looking for?” Celine asked.\n“The closest plantation.” Styke handed the reins to Celine and removed\na skull-and-lance banner from his saddlebags before tying it to the tip of his\nlance and raising it above him.\nThey crossed several streams and a mile of plantation fields full of\nbonded Palo working desperately to harvest the half-grown fields. No one\nchallenged Styke as he rode past, but Ka-poel received more than a few\ncurious glances.\n“Who are we going to kill?” Celine asked."

A mean son of a\nbitch—mean enough to keep the men from pilfering the rations when times\nwere lean. But we were all mean back then.”\n“Why do you want to kill him?”\nHe felt a knot tighten in his stomach. Over the years people had called\nhim a brute, a murderer, even a monster. He’d been all those things and\nmore, but the idea of killing someone who’d once ridden at his side was\ndistasteful. Murdering Agoston had sated his rage the other night, but it had\nalso left him feeling queasy. He supposed he could just forget the whole\nthing, but … vengeance needed having. “It’s complicated.”\n“So?” She looked up at him expectantly.\n“Do you know what ‘precocious’ means?”\n“I know I’m one. Ibana said so.”\nKa-poel grinned openly at Styke.\n“Of course she did.” Styke checked his knife and drew the blade down\nhis whetstone a few times before stowing them both, taking the reins from\nCeline’s hands. He wondered if he was getting such a young child too used\nto the idea of blood and death, and had to remind himself that she’d seen\nmen gut each other over a biscuit in the labor camps, and she’d watched her\nown father drown in the fens. He pointed to the sorcery-healed scar on his\nleft hand between the knuckles of his third and fourth finger. “This,” he\nsaid, then pointed to his leg, then his face. “This, and this. All from the\nfiring squad ten years ago.” The sorcerous healing of his wounds had come\nten years too late, and they all still ached every day—and those two fingers\nstill didn’t like to obey him.\nCeline took Styke’s hand in hers, running her fingers over the wound,\nthen across his knuckles. Her hands were tiny compared to his. “Did Tenny\nWiles shoot at you?”\n“Not exactly.”\nStyke ignored Celine’s further questions as he spotted a nearby driveway\nand directed Amrec away from the riverbank. The drive ran beside the river\nfor a few hundred yards and then across an open lawn to a manor house.\nThe manor had the typical flat facade in the common style of Fatrastan\nplantations. As far as those went, it wasn’t immense—though it was\nobviously the home of a rich man. The fountain out front was in disrepair,\nthe paint on the shutters peeling, but otherwise the house and grounds were\nin decent condition for an older home.\nStyke felt his queasiness increase, and he thought about Agoston’s blood\non his hands and arms and pictured the look on Tenny Wiles’s face as he\ngutted him. Killing old comrades. A dirty business, even for him."

A dirty business, even for him.\nA carriage and a dozen wagons filled the drive just outside the front\ndoor, and a flurry of activity filled the vestibule as servants rushed to load\nthe wagons with furniture and supplies.\nStyke caught sight of Bad Tenny Wiles standing on the front step,\ndirecting the whole thing. Tenny was probably five years younger than\nStyke, and hadn’t borne the rigors of the labor camps, but he did not look\ngood. His split nose was red and runny, and the side of his face with the\nmissing ear was covered in the scars of a past infection. But it was\ndefinitely Tenny—just wearing expensive clothes.\nEveryone was so focused on packing the house that they didn’t seem to\nnotice Styke as he came up the drive, rounded the fountain, and\ndismounted. He pulled Celine down and set her next to Amrec, handing her\nthe reins. “Stay here,” he said. The knot in his stomach was still there, but\nhe could feel it loosening beneath the resolute feeling of a job that needed\ndoing.\n“I could come with.”\n“You don’t need to watch me skin a man.” He pointed at Ka-poel. “You\nstay here, too.”\nHe left Celine scowling at his back as he headed through the bustle of\nthe servants and toward the front door, stopping just a few feet from the\nbottom step. He sighed, a hand on the hilt of his knife, and let his weight\nfall on his good leg as he waited for Tenny to notice him.\nIt didn’t take long. Tenny directed two servants maneuvering a feather\nmattress out the door, pointing to one of the wagons. On noticing Styke, his\nmouth opened and he blinked in confusion. Slowly, the blood drained from\nhis face.\n“Hello, Tenny,” Styke said.\nBad Tenny Wiles, the scourge of unwary Kez infantry, began to tremble.\nIt started in his hands, then moved through his body until Styke thought he\nmight convulse and fall to the ground in a fit. He waited for a weapon to\nappear in Tenny’s hands, and the quick exchange of blood to follow. He did\nnot expect Tenny to turn and flee into the house.\nThe pounding of retreating footsteps surprised Styke, and it took him a\nmoment to follow. He passed startled servants, listening to Tenny’s shouts,\nand followed them up the grand staircase to the second floor. He paused for\na moment on the landing, the house suddenly silent.\n“You there!” a servant called, mounting the stairs below Styke with a\nfirepoker in his hand.\nStyke pointed his knife at the man, then continued upward. No one\nfollowed.\nHe prowled the second floor, glancing in each room, moving with slow,\ndeliberate steps. He expected the blast of a blunderbuss as he opened every\ndoor, or the ring of a pistol shot.

He’d stilled his trembles, and he held a pistol in\none hand, pointed at Styke. “Not another step,” he growled. “I don’t care if\nyou’re a ghost or the real thing, but I will pull this trigger.”\n“Do you think you can finish with one bullet what a firing squad\ncouldn’t with twenty?” Styke asked. He entered the room, glancing around\nfor a bevy of servants waiting to jump him. There was no one else, so he let\nhimself relax slightly, glancing around at the furniture and ceiling as if he\nmeant to buy the place. “What was your price, Tenny?” he asked. “How\nmuch did Fidelis Jes pay you to betray me? Was it this place? A whole\nplantation? I’ll admit you got a good deal. I hope you enjoyed the last ten\nyears more than I did.”\nTenny’s pistol didn’t waver. “How did you know? Pit, how are you still\nalive? Jes told me they finished the job!”\nStyke had once watched Tenny kill a whole squad of grenadiers with a\nbroken sword after one of them cut off his ear. He’d never heard that edge\nof panic in Bad Tenny Wiles’s voice. But seeing a ghost will do that to a\nman.\n“I spent ten years in the labor camps thinking that Fidelis Jes had\narranged my failed execution—then disappearance—without any of my\nmen knowing. I shouldn’t have been so naive. I got out two months ago, re-\nformed the Mad Lancers, and helped defend Landfall. So how do I know?\nTurns out you didn’t come to my funeral. Markus and Zac noticed, and they\nfound out that you and a few others got paid off by the Blackhats. Doesn’t\ntake much math to figure out why.”\n“I didn’t—”\nStyke cut him off. “I know, Tenny. I killed Agoston a few days ago.”\n“Does everyone else know?” Tenny whispered.\n“Me, Ibana, Jackal. Markus and Zac,” Styke said. “I haven’t decided\nwhether to take your head back to show the rest. You’re lucky Ibana isn’t\nhere. She would—”\nAs Styke spoke, the muzzle of Tenny’s pistol suddenly dipped, then\njerked up toward his mouth. Tenny grabbed the muzzle in his lips and\nsqueezed his eyes shut.\nStyke crossed the room in two quick strides and jerked the pistol out of\nTenny’s hand. He tossed it on the bed, grasping Tenny by the front of his\nsuit and shaking him hard enough to rattle his teeth. Tenny reached for a\nknife at his belt, but Styke slapped it away and lifted Tenny off the ground.\nHe drew his boz knife and held the tip to Tenny’s throat. A quick jerk, and\nStyke would have another traitor’s lifeblood spilling down his arms.\n“You don’t get to take your own life,” Styke snarled. “You gave up that\nprivilege the moment you betrayed me and the lancers.”\n“I didn’t want to, damn it!

They\nsaid we were better without you, and Fidelis Jes, he—”\nStyke shook him again. “Don’t mention that piece of shit. You know\nwhat I did after Landfall last month? I found Jes and cut his damned head\noff and sent it to Lindet.” He looked around the room, feeling angry and\nsick. “You traded me for this, Tenny. Don’t worry, because you only have to\nlive with it for a few more minutes.”\nFinish the job, he told himself silently. Have it done and be gone. He\nthought of Agoston’s blood and squeezed his eyes shut.\n“You don’t have to do it, Ben,” Tenny whispered.\n“Oh, shut up.” Styke carried Tenny across the room and threw him out\nthe big bay window.\nGlass shattered, and Tenny’s scream was undercut by a shrill one from\nthe closet. Styke whirled as the closet opened, and a woman in her early\ntwenties burst forth. Two young children hid among the clothes inside,\nfrightened, staring at Styke—a crippled giant of a man with a fighting knife\nas long as a sword. The woman looked from him to the window and took a\nstep back, her eyes rolling like those of a frightened horse.\n“Stay here,” Styke ordered. He strode into the hall to find a crowd of\nworried servants. Shoving them aside, he headed downstairs and out to the\nside of the house, where he found Tenny lying on the lawn among broken\nglass and fragments of a windowsill. Tenny’s eyes were closed, his arm bent\nbeneath him and obviously broken, but his chest rose and fell. He gnashed\nhis teeth against the pain, trying to move.\nTenny’s eyes shot open as Styke approached. “Why are you still alive?”\nhe whispered between gritted teeth.\nStyke squatted beside him, knife loose in his hand. Above them both, the\nwoman stood at the window, wailing. “Because none of the gods have\ninvented anything to kill me yet,” he replied. “Don’t pretend this is a\nsurprise. You knew who and what I was when you decided to sell me to\nFidelis Jes.” He tapped the tip of his knife against Tenny’s collarbone.\nTenny trembled, but Styke could tell that it was from pain, and no longer\nfear. He could see the acceptance of a dead man in Tenny’s eyes. “Gut me,”\nTenny said. “Flay me. Do what you need to do. I deserve it. But leave these\npeople out of it. Don’t do it in the sight of my wife and children. I know\nwho and what you are, Colonel, and I know you are better than that.”\nStyke glanced up at the window again. The woman had disappeared, and\nonly servants stared down at him. He could still hear her wailing. He\nwondered if begging had ever stalled the blade of the old Ben Styke—if the\ninvocation of a wife and children had ever kept him from a bloody deed.

If\nit had, it was a long time ago.\nHe felt eyes on him, and glanced over his shoulder to find Celine\nstanding by the corner of the house. She still clutched Amrec’s reins, and\nthe big horse nibbled at the grass without a care in the world. Stone-faced,\nCeline watched Styke, eyeing the knife in his hand and the man at his feet.\nKa-poel stood behind her with an appraising look in her eye.\n“Finish it, Styke,” Tenny said. “Don’t make me linger. It’s not your\nstyle. Drag me into those woods over there. Finish the job. Just don’t do it\nin front of them.”\nStyke frowned at Celine. The girl’s head was cocked to the side as if she\nwere watching a butcher about to cut up a side of beef. He felt conflicted,\nthat war between his lust for vengeance and the sickness brought on by\nkilling his own men. Celine scowled at him, clearly finding something\namiss.\nStyke bowed his head. Tenny deserved to die, no question about that.\nBut Styke couldn’t help but hesitate. He took a deep breath, let out a sigh,\nand tapped Tenny’s collarbone with the tip of his knife again.\n“Get that arm set and wrapped,” he heard himself say softly as he stood.\n“The Dynize are close by. If you leave by sundown, you might outrun their\nscouts. The river valley is choked with refugees, so you’ll want to go\nsouthwest.”\n“What are you doing?” Tenny gasped. He tried to sit up, voice dripping\nwith suspicion.\n“I’m not gonna skin an old comrade in front of his own household. Even\nif you deserve it. Get out of here, Tenny. Change your name. You should\nprobably leave the country. If Ibana ever finds you, she’ll turn you into a\nrug.” Styke sheathed his knife and headed back to Celine. He took Amrec’s\nreins.\n“I thought you were gonna skin him,” Celine said.\n“Nobody likes a bloodthirsty little git,” Styke said, swinging into the\nsaddle. Celine climbed up in front of him.\n“I’m not bloodthirsty,” she protested. “I was just curious. Why didn’t\nyou kill him?”\nStyke took her by the shoulder. He searched her eyes for eagerness or\ndisappointment. Finding neither, he flipped the reins. “Hardest thing a\nsoldier can do is leave the killing behind him. Tenny didn’t sell me out for\nmoney or power. He sold me out for a better life. Shitty thing to do, but he\nwent somewhere he couldn’t hear the hooves and the cannons and became a\ngood husband to a fat little country girl. He did what I should have done\ntwenty-five years ago.”\n“So you’re just gonna let him go?”\n“I’m just gonna let him go,” Styke confirmed. The rage still burned in\nhis chest, but that queasiness was now gone. “I’ve got plenty of killing to\ndo. One less mark on my knife handle won’t make a difference.

        "text": "do. One less mark on my knife handle won’t make a difference. Just don’t\ntell Ibana.”\nCHAPTER 18\nT\nhe rolling plains of southern Fatrasta turned into the foothills of the\nIronhook Mountains as Vlora and Taniel rode north ahead of the army. They\nfollowed the banks of the Hadshaw for nearly three hundred miles, pushing\nthemselves and their spare horses hard before cutting west and heading into\nthe mountains.\nThe roads became narrower, climbing steep hills and crossing deep\nravines over bridges that became increasingly untrustworthy. Farmsteads\ngave way to forests of towering pines as they left behind the regular\nvillages.\nProgress grew slower and slower as the terrain sharpened. The depth of\nthe forest gave Vlora a sense of foreboding. More than swamps of the\nTristan Basin, this land felt as if it were on the edge of civilization, isolated\nand wild, a place where she could scream for ten miles of road and no one\nwould hear her. They bought supplies from the infrequent logging camps\nand express depots, and it took them almost seven days to reach the\noutskirts of Yellow Creek.\nThe county limits were marked by a flatboard nailed to a stick, written\nin charcoal, and guarded by a rough-cut log tower with two men armed with\nrifles. The guards watched them approach, but did not hail them or\ncomment on their passing.\nVlora turned in her saddle to look back at them as she passed. “Not\nmuch of a guard post.”\n“They aren’t looking for Kressians,” Taniel said.\nThis should have surprised Vlora. “Palo?”\n“Definitely Palo. Kressians out here stick together—they have to, or the\nPalo war parties will pick them apart.”\n“I didn’t know there still were aggressive tribes this close to the coast.\nWe’re just a few hundred miles from Landfall.”\nTaniel looked up to watch a circling buzzard. “There are a handful of\nindependent tribes on this side of the Ironhook, but they all have treaties\nwith Lindet in order to ensure their survival. The problem is expeditions\nfrom the other side of the mountains.”\n“Then why was that guard post way down here? Why wasn’t it up in the\nmountains?”\nTaniel grinned at her. “You ever try to explain the difference between\ngroups of Palo to the average Fatrastan?”\n“No.”\n“That kind of nuance is lost on most people. A Palo is a Palo, regardless\nof where they come from. If Palo from across the mountains attack the trade\nroutes to and from Yellow Creek, the townspeople just assume it was one of\nthe neighboring tribes.” Taniel tapped the side of his head. “People\ndesperate enough to come out here to settle the frontier don’t always have\nthe best critical-thinking skills. It’s easier to shoot first and ask questions\nlater.”\nVlora spotted a cabin at the top of a nearby gully—the first sign of\nsettlement she’d seen in twenty miles. A few minutes later, she spotted\nanother one. “Damn near getting crowded now,” she muttered to herself.\n“So these Palo coming across the mountains … are they from the Palo\nNation?”\n“Almost certainly.”\n“I thought you said they were different. More civilized.”\nTaniel considered this for a moment. “The Palo Nation is complicated."

More civilized.”\nTaniel considered this for a moment. “The Palo Nation is complicated.\nThey have no interest in having what happened to the southern Palo happen\nto them. So they sit behind the mountains and send raids. They scout, they\nkill and steal. They do what’s expected of them, because they don’t want\nLindet to suspect that they are anything more than an upstart tribe.”\n“Then, what are they?”\nTaniel looked at her seriously. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”\n“Try me.”\n“They’re a republic.”\nVlora scoffed. “You’re joking.”\n“Not at all.”\n“A bona fide republic?”\nTaniel nodded, and Vlora found herself struggling with the idea. She’d\nfought the Palo up in the Tristan Basin. They weren’t stupid by any means,\nbut their tribal societies didn’t have room for a concept like republicanism.\nThey lived year to year, fighting among themselves, in a place where\nsurvival of the strongest was the rule. She’d always considered advanced\nforms of government a “civilized” luxury.\n“How do you know?” she asked.\n“I lived with them for a while.” He pulled off his glove, showing her the\nreddened skin of his right hand. “Who do you think funds the Red Hand?”\n“I assumed it was leftists in Landfall.”\n“Some of it, sure. But the Palo Nation loves having Lindet run around\nafter freedom fighters instead of pushing closer to their territory.”\n“Does she have any idea about any of this?”\n“Honestly, I can say that this is one of the few things Lindet doesn’t\nactually know.”\nVlora imagined the look on Lindet’s face when she found out that there\nwas a literal Palo Nation just on the other side of the Ironhooks. “Aren’t\nthere explorers?”\n“Plenty. But Kressians don’t last long beyond the Ironhooks.”\n“Oh? Then how did you?”\nTaniel’s face soured. “I was with Ka-poel, for one. For another …” He\ntrailed off.\n“Yeah?”\n“I had to murder a small army in self-defense to get them to leave me\nalone.”\nVlora quickly dropped that line of questioning. Her attention shifted to\nthe larger number of paths diverging off the main road into the forest, and\nthen a small family they passed driving a wagon the opposite direction. The\none wagon became two, then four, then ten. It was the most traffic they’d\nseen since leaving the Riflejacks behind.\n“There’s a lot of Palo,” she commented to Taniel, watching a woman\npass by with a yoke over her shoulders, suspending two pails of water.\n“They’re good labor.”\n“I thought you said the Kressian settlers don’t like Palo.”\n“They don’t like sharing an address or a drink with them. They do like\nhow hard they work.”\n“How the pit are those guards back there supposed to tell the difference\nbetween a good Palo and a bad Palo?”\n“The way they’re dressed,” Taniel said. He tugged at the front of his\nbuckskin jacket. “If they’re dressed like me, they’re bad.” He pointed to her"

He tugged at the front of his\nbuckskin jacket. “If they’re dressed like me, they’re bad.” He pointed to her\njacket and tricorn hat. “If they’re dressed like you, they’re good.”\n“That’s stupid.”\n“Like I said, no time for critical thinking on the frontier.”\nThey finally reached the outskirts of town—a muddy track that suddenly\nturned muddier and led under an enormous wooden sign that said WELCOME\nTO YELLOW CREEK. The canyon opened up into a large valley a couple of\nmiles across, clear-cut and organized, and filled with wooden buildings of\nall sorts—hardware stores, whorehouses, banks, letter-writing services,\ncobblers, and everything in between.\nThe town itself was dense and claustrophobic, trash and shit trod\nunderfoot and filling Vlora’s nostrils with a vile stench. The scenery around\nthem, however, was gorgeous. Mountains rose in every direction, shooting\nup from the pine-forested foothills to bare rock that towered impossibly\nhigh into a ribbon of clouds.\n“I miss Adro,” Taniel said quietly.\nVlora turned toward him sharply, but his face was impassive. “So do I,”\nshe said.\nThey rode deeper into the town in companionable silence, and Vlora\nrealized that she would be shocked if the town housed fewer than ten\nthousand people. Not a proper city, certainly, but a veritable metropolis this\nfar out on the frontier. “This is much bigger than I expected,” she said over\nthe din of the traffic.\nTaniel’s eyebrows rose. “I’ll admit, I’m a little surprised. I’ve never been\nin a gold-rush town bigger than a few hundred people. There must be a\ndamn huge amount of gold in these mountains.” He raised his hand. “This’ll\ndo.”\nVlora followed him across the street to a large building on the corner of\nan intersection. Large letters over the roof proclaimed HOTEL while a sign\nbeside the door said VACANCIES. NO PALO. NO GURLISH. Vlora nearly objected,\nbefore realizing that every proper-looking building on the street had a\nsimilar sign. Some rejected Kez. Others rejected Stren or Rosveleans. There\nwas even one that said in bold letters ADRANS NOT ADMITTED.\n“I see this is a happy, inclusive place,” she commented, tying her horse\nto a hitching post. “I thought you said the Kressians stick together.”\nTaniel looked uncertain for the first time since the Dynize had arrived.\n“It’s been a while since I’ve been up this direction. It seems old hatreds are\ncropping back up.”\nVlora bit back a comment about Taniel not knowing as much as he\nthought he knew. She was still uncertain about his ulterior motives in this\nwhole endeavor, but she did trust him. There was no reason to upset him if\nshe didn’t have to.\nThe hotel great room was two stories, highlighting a winding staircase\nand a row of rooms that looked down from the balcony above them with\nhallways going off to the side. Most of the main area was taken up with a\nbar and tables. At this hour they were empty but for a pair of drunks\nbemoaning some awful fate over in the corner."

At this hour they were empty but for a pair of drunks\nbemoaning some awful fate over in the corner.\nVlora and Taniel were greeted by a wormy little man in a faded purple\njacket and flatcap. He called to them from behind a podium that said in\nblock letters HOTEL MANAGER. He said something quickly in Brudanian.\n“We need two rooms,” Vlora told him.\nThe manager switched to Adran. “Two rooms will be tight, I’m afraid.\nThe city is very crowded right now and most of the guests are doubling or\neven quadrupling up!” He followed the sentence with a simpering laugh.\nVlora looked at Taniel, who just shrugged at her, and decided she had no\ninterest in sharing a bed—no matter how platonic—with an ex-lover. “How\nmuch?” she asked.\n“Forty for the week. Sixty includes lunch and dinner. Drinks are extra.”\nVlora plunked a handful of large coins on the podium, sorting through\nthem carelessly and then sliding two across to the manager. “Two rooms.”\nShe slid another two across to him.\nThe manager licked his lips. “I think we’ve just had a vacancy.”\n“Good.”\nThe manager hurried away, and Vlora turned to look across the great\nroom. It wasn’t much, but it would be home for the next couple of weeks.\nTaniel slid up next to her, leaning in so that only she could hear him.\n“You haven’t really learned subtlety, have you?” he asked.\nShe felt her already dubious mood sour. “I’m a goddamn Adran general.\nI don’t do subtlety.”\n“You’re not an Adran general here,” Taniel said. “We’ve got to stay low\nuntil we find this thing. You saw those postal relays on the highway. Word\ncould reach Lindet about our presence within a week. The notes I found in\nher personal library indicated she was already snooping around in this neck\nof the woods, so she doubtlessly has spies in the city. The Dynize might,\ntoo.”\nVlora grunted. As much as she hated to admit it, Taniel was right. Their\nwhole purpose here—coming without her army—was to get in and get out\nwithout being detected by enemy agents. Handing the manager enough\nmoney to buy a horse just to get an extra hotel room was probably ill-\nadvised.\nThe manager returned with their keys and a pallid smile. “If there’s\nanything else I can do for you, please let me know.” His eyes ran across\nVlora and Taniel’s weapons; then he leaned across the podium\nconspiratorially. “You’ll do well here, I think.”\nVlora, whose attention had wandered from the dislikable man, turned to\nhim sharply. “What do you mean by that?”\nThe manager recoiled. “I mean, with the troubles brewing. You’re\nsoldiers of fortune, aren’t you? Mercenaries?”\nTaniel didn’t look any happier than Vlora. “What kind of trouble?” he\nasked.\n“The Picks and the Shovels,” the manager explained. “I assumed you\ncame because of the newspaper advertisements.”"

She looked at Taniel, then\ncontinued on cautiously. “We just thought we’d find work guarding some\ncaravans or mines.”\n“A happy coincidence, in your line of work,” the manager said with the\ntone of voice that implied he expected a large tip. “Trouble’s been heating\nup the last few months. There’s two groups in town that own most of the big\nmines around here, and they’ve been trying to buy each other out. The Picks\nown most of the eastern side of the valley.” He waved vaguely over his\nshoulder. “And the Shovels own the west side. Their big bosses have been\nbringing in more and more muscle to try and make a point. If one of them\ndoesn’t agree to sell, it’ll be bloodshed by the end of the month.”\nVlora prayed they’d be gone by then. The last thing she needed was their\npresence being complicated with a war over prospecting rights. She thought\nback to the Palo in the Tristan Basin and then in Greenfire Depths, and\nrealized local politics had been plaguing her entire time in Fatrasta.\nShe plastered a thankful smile on her face and palmed a five-krana coin,\nshaking the manager’s hand. “Have those rooms cleaned out by supper.\nFresh linen, and flip the mattresses.” She retreated to the front stoop of the\nhotel, feeling suddenly claustrophobic. The pungent smell of the mining\ntown didn’t help, but turning her face to the sun allowed her to breathe\nmore easily. A few minutes passed before Taniel joined her.\n“You’re getting posh in your old age.”\nVlora opened one eye and glanced sidelong at Taniel. “And you’re still\njust a bit of a smug asshole, you know that?” There was more bite in her\nwords than she’d meant, but she let them stand.\nInstead of getting angry, Taniel laughed. “I won’t argue that. You and\nDad were really the only ones that ever seemed to notice.”\n“Everyone noticed. But they were scared of either you or Tamas. That\nfamous family temper. Come to think of it, I haven’t seen it come out since\nyou resurfaced.”\nTaniel’s smile disappeared, his forehead creased. “I don’t want to be my\nfather.”\nVlora bit back a remark. Taniel had fled from his father’s legacy, faking\nhis own death. Vlora had embraced that legacy and become the renowned\ngeneral—but at the end of the day she didn’t have Tamas’s political skills to\ndeal with the Adran government. Coming here with a mercenary army had\nbeen her own sort of running away, so calling Taniel out on his seemed\nmore than a little hypocritical.\nVlora let the silence stretch, taking in the city. It was much dryer up here\nin the mountains than it had been in either Landfall or the Tristan Basin, and\nshe was glad for it. The heat was more bearable, too, but she imagined the\nbugs would be just as bad come nightfall."

The heat was more bearable, too, but she imagined the\nbugs would be just as bad come nightfall.\n“I’m going to go for a … walk,” she said, eyeing a nearby bar. “Get the\nbearings of the city.”\n“Good thinking. I’ll do the same.”\nThey split up, heading in different directions down the street. Vlora\nwaited until she was out of sight and ducked into one of the dozens of bars\nthat seemed so prolific along the main thoroughfare. It was barely a\nbuilding—not much bigger than a good hotel room with three tables and a\nsingle barkeep pouring drinks for the miners heading toward or coming\nback from the hills.\nShe ordered a beer and took a seat facing the open door, watching the\nfaces pass her in the street, and put her feet up on the chair opposite to\ndiscourage company. The beer was terrible, but it was cold, and she downed\nit quickly and went for another. It took a lot for a powder mage to get\ndrunk, but she wasn’t looking for that—just the slightest buzz to take the\nedge off the soreness from a week in the saddle, and a week with Taniel.\nShe wondered why it bothered her so much. They’d parted on good\nterms, and she hadn’t seen him for ten long years. In the years since, she’d\nthought long and hard about whether she had any residual feelings for him,\nand decided it wasn’t that, either.\nPerhaps it was because they’d been practically siblings before becoming\nlovers. Taniel and Tamas had saved her from the streets and given her\npurpose, and Taniel had been her closest friend and confidant. She\nwondered if there was a part of her that wanted that back. Taniel’s murky\nambitions, and her own growth over the last decade, made that an\nimpossibility.\nVlora’s contemplations—and her fourth beer—were cut off by a figure\npassing through the street outside the bar. She frowned, tilting her head to\nthe side and glancing at the glass in front of her. She almost ignored the\nfigure, but curiosity got her to her feet and out onto the stoop. She caught\nanother glimpse, and hurried along the walkway to try and get another one,\npausing for a moment at the next intersection as the figure finally turned to\ngive her a view.\nIt was a tall, distinct-looking woman with the shoulders of a boxer and\nlong brown hair in a ponytail. She carried a blunderbuss casually on one\nshoulder and the right side of her face was reddened by an old blast wound\nthat left her eye milky white. Vlora was certain she knew the woman, yet\nhesitated for long enough that her quarry slipped down a side alley.\nVlora hurried across the street and turned down the alley, only to come\nface-to-face with the flared muzzle of a blunderbuss. “Follow me one more\nstep and I will blow your … Vlora?”\n“I’ll be damned,” Vlora said, raising her hands, open palms outward. “It\nis you. How are you, Little Flerring?”\n“You’ll be damned? By Adom, Vlora, what the pit are you doing in"

        "text": "is you. How are you, Little Flerring?”\n“You’ll be damned? By Adom, Vlora, what the pit are you doing in\nYellow Creek?” Flerring lowered the blunderbuss and thrust a hand toward\nVlora, which she shook happily.\n“It’s a long story, but I could ask you the same thing.” The conversation\nwas interrupted by the arrival of Taniel, who stepped into the alleyway\nbehind Flerring, his sword drawn. Vlora turned to him sharply. “Were you\nfollowing me?”\n“I was just trying to catch up.”\n“I thought we’d split up for the night?”\nTaniel stared at Flerring, clearly unwilling to say more in front of her.\nHe eyed her blunderbuss for a moment before putting up his sword. He did\nnot answer her question.\nFlerring looked back and forth between Vlora and Taniel, finding herself\nboxed in, and scowled at Taniel. “Who the pit is this? Aren’t you still with\nOlem?”\n“It’s not like that,” Vlora explained, gesturing Taniel to join her. He\nslipped past Flerring and came to stand beside Vlora. He leaned in,\nspeaking in a whisper that only she could hear.\n“So you know each other?”\n“We do,” Vlora said. “She’s a longtime contractor for the Adran Army.”\nShe smiled reassuringly at Flerring and said in a low voice, “Should we tell\nher who you are?”\n“You trust her?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then go ahead.” Taniel shrugged, dropping the whisper. “Your men\nalready know. Word will get out eventually that I’m still alive.”\n“All right.” Vlora spoke up. “Little Flerring, this is Taniel Two-shot.”\nFlerring scoffed. “No shitting?”\n“No shitting,” Taniel said, offering his hand.\nVlora continued. “Taniel, this is Little Flerring. She makes powder. She\nsold the Adran Army enough gunpowder to get us through the Kez Civil\nWar, and then some.”\nFlerring took Taniel’s hand. “Two damn powder mages out here on the\nfrontier. Adran powder mages, and one of you is supposed to be dead. What\nare you doing here?”\nTaniel whispered softly, “You’re sure you trust her?”\n“I do,” Vlora responded. “She’s an Adran hero after the Kez Civil War,\nand we worked together closely.”\n“You better trust her,” Taniel said, still in a whisper, “because it’s here.”\n“The stone?”\n“Yes. I sensed it moments after we split up. I’ve been trying to find you\nto tell you. It’s definitely here, but I don’t know where. We might need help\nfinding it.”\nVlora had no idea why Taniel could sense the thing and she could not. It\nprobably had something to do with Ka-poel’s sorcery. But confirming it was\nactually here was the first step in their mission. “Flerring,” she said, “do\nyou have somewhere we could talk?”\nCHAPTER 19\nM\nichel spent nearly a week following Marhoush before finally losing\npatience.\nHe and Tenik sat on the rooftop of an abandoned store about a block\nfrom the cobbler’s, where their target had been holed up this entire time.

        "text": "patience.\nHe and Tenik sat on the rooftop of an abandoned store about a block\nfrom the cobbler’s, where their target had been holed up this entire time. It\nwas a blisteringly hot afternoon, the roofing tar sticking to the bottom of\ntheir shoes, but Michel wanted the vantage point to be able to see down into\nthe street both in front of and behind Marhoush’s hiding spot. He sat near\nthe edge of the flat roof, hidden behind a cluster of chimney stacks, and\nwatched the street while he and Tenik sweltered.\nA week, he knew, was a long time. There’d been two other bombings. A\nperpetrator had been caught after the second, but she’d managed to commit\nsuicide before being questioned. Michel had recognized the body as that of\na Bronze Rose who worked for je Tura.\nBeyond that one lead, none of Yaret’s Household had managed to get\nany closer to tracking down the source of the bombings.\n“Marhoush hasn’t come outside for over a day,” Tenik observed. The\nDynize had his feet up, his shirt off and wrapped around his head to shade it\nfrom the sun.\n“He might have a secret entrance,” Michel responded. He’d spent the\nfirst two days scouring the area and consulting old maps to find out if that\nwere the case. The basement of the cobbler’s shop might connect with the\ncatacombs within the plateau, but he didn’t think they did. More likely,\nMarhoush had slipped out sometime the night before last when Michel was\ncatching a little sleep and just hadn’t come back. He’d left one of Yaret’s\nHousehold layabouts to keep watch but didn’t know if they were at all\nreliable.\nMichel would soon find out. He consulted his pocket watch, then\nglanced down the street, where he saw a squad of Dynize soldiers milling\nabout in the intersection. They took their helmets off, exchanged skins of\ntea, and spoke freely among themselves. A similar scene was playing out in\ntwo other nearby intersections, and Michel couldn’t help but smile.\nIn the short time he’d been among the Dynize, he’d found out a great\nmany things. One was that Yaret’s Household had access to hundreds,\nperhaps thousands of loyal soldiers that could be called upon in a pinch.\nAnother thing he’d learned was that Dynize soldiers took orders very well.\nGive them a battle plan and they’d follow it. Explain how to properly stage\na raid, and they’d follow your instructions to the letter.\n“What happens if we don’t catch the Silver Rose?” Tenik asked. He took\nout his coin for the first time in two days and flipped it, caught it, then\nflipped it again.\n“Depends on the size of the safe house and the number of Blackhats we\npull out of it. If we catch even two of them, we’ll be able to start asking\nquestions. They might put us back on Marhoush’s track or even help us find\nthe Gold Rose.” He didn’t bother adding if we’re lucky. He was incredibly\nfrustrated that Marhoush had slipped past him, and if this raid came up with\nnothing useful, he’d be out a week’s worth of work.\nWhich wouldn’t inspire confidence in his new boss.\nTenik lifted his hands, ticking off fingers as he spoke. “Iron Roses are"

I earned my Gold Rose just before the invasion by\ntracking down a Palo freedom fighter. I was a Silver Rose for a couple\nyears.”\n“This Marhoush … how well do you know him?”\n“Only by sight. We’ve met twice, I think.”\n“You have a good memory?”\n“When you’re a spy, you have to develop a talent for names and faces.\nIt’ll save your life.”\n“And how well do you know the Gold Rose he works for?”\n“Je Tura?” Michel thought for a moment, picturing je Tura in his mind.\n“I saw him at the Millinery once. He’s a mean, stocky little bastard. Shorter\nthan you and twice as wide. Carries a broadsword around with him.”\nTenik snorted. “Does he use it?”\n“Often, from what I’ve heard. Chops off the hands of people who anger\nhim, the feet of people who betray him, and the heads of his enemies.”\n“And your people call us savages?” Tenik tilted his head to get a view of\nthe street before getting comfortable once more. “There are always rumors\nabout powerful people. Are any of them true?”\n“I’m not sure. I didn’t believe half the rumors about Fidelis Jes until I\nbegan to work directly under him.”\n“I’ve heard of this Fidelis Jes,” Tenik said. “He was one of the people\nour informants told us to be wary of as we tried to take the city. Was he a\ngood master?”\nMichel considered the threats and the morning duels. “I believe he was\ngood at his job.”\n“That is not the same as being a good master.”\n“He was an asshole and I’m not sad that Ben Styke cut his head off.”\nTenik grinned broadly. “That is the answer I was looking for. You will\nfind Yaret a much better master than that. When he dies, I’ll grieve as much\nas any of his family.”\nTenik had referenced Yaret as a good person or a considerate master on\nseveral occasions throughout the last week. Michel hadn’t spent any time\nwith him since that first day, so he didn’t have a point of reference, but he\ndoubted that Yaret could live up to the hype. Michel had worked under\ndecent people and even competent Roses, but in his experience, the higher\nup the chain of command, the less room there was for basic humanity.\nMichel kept facing the street but watched Tenik out of the corner of his\neye. He’d come to rather like the man over the course of the week. Tenik\nwas a wealth of knowledge about his people but seemed just as interested in\nlearning about Fatrasta and the Nine as Michel was about the Dynize. He\nrarely turned Michel away from a question and had a quiet sense of humor\nthat belied his sharp eyes and ability to grasp a concept or situation easily.\nHe was also, Michel had found, oddly naive in certain ways.\nThe situation between the Palo and the Kressians was one of those."

He followed\nTenik’s gaze down to a Kressian man openly beating a Palo laborer about\nthe shoulders with his cane, only retreating when one of the Dynize soldiers\nseemed to take interest in the altercation.\n“Yes,” Michel said, returning to his examination of the cobbler’s shop.\nThe Dynize soldiers relaxing at the various intersections began to put their\nhelmets back on, saying good-byes as if they had finished a quiet afternoon\nbreak.\n“You’re Palo, aren’t you?”\n“Part,” Michel responded. He leaned forward, watching as the soldiers\nfixed their bayonets and shouldered their weapons, then began to walk\nswiftly toward the cobbler’s shop. Their counterparts on three different\nintersections began to do the same, forming a pincer movement that would\ncut off all four possible avenues of escape from the safe house.\nTenik didn’t seem to notice that the raid was going forward. “If you’re\nhalf Palo, and the Kressians treat the Palo so poorly, why do you fight for\nthem?”\nMichel had no interest in explaining the ulterior motives he had for\njoining the Blackhats and climbing their ranks. For one, it would raise too\nmany questions. For another—well, the whole situation was a sore point, to\nsay the least. He wondered briefly where Taniel’s people had hidden his\nmother and hoped she was well out of harm’s way. “Because,” Michel\nanswered glibly, “I can still take advantage of being half Kressian to live a\nbetter life.” He directed Tenik’s attention to the raid. “Here we go.”\nDynize soldiers flooded the cobbler’s shop, the alley next to it, and the\nbuildings on either side. They cut off every possible exit and kicked in the\ndoors, rushing inside with bayonets ready. The raid was a complete surprise\n—Michel could tell from the lack of gunfire and the surprised look of the\nRoses as they were dragged into the street and held at musket-point. Michel\nexamined each as they were brought out, praying that Marhoush would be\none of the faces.\nHe wasn’t. Thirteen in total were pulled from the cobbler’s shop. Michel\nguessed that only seven of those were actual Roses—the rest sympathizers.\nA small crowd of onlookers began to assemble. The soldiers ignored them,\ndragging off their captives, and the traffic soon returned to normal. Michel\nwaited for about five minutes before he signaled to Tenik.\n“Let’s go see what kind of a catch we got.”\nThe captives had been taken to an abandoned warehouse about half a\nmile away. Michel and Tenik joined the captain of the soldiers just outside.\n“We found Roses on four of them,” the captain said, dropping the\nmedallions into Tenik’s outstretched hand. There were three Irons and a\nBronze. “Two others seem to be Blackhats as well. The rest claim\nignorance.”\n“The cobbler?” Michel asked."

He\nproceeded to a spot just above the group of prisoners. They sat on the dirt\nfloor, hands tied, heads down, with a group of soldiers keeping watch.\nMichel leaned on the catwalk railing and examined them for several\nminutes.\n“That one,” he finally said in a quiet voice, pointing to a woman whose\nlip bled from being smacked around by a soldier. “She’s a Bronze Rose. She\nused to be a Silver Rose. A year ago she was caught taking protection\nmoney from a family who had personal ties to Lindet. She was demoted.”\nTenik frowned at the information. “What does that mean?”\n“It means she’s a greedy little piggy,” Michel responded. “Bring her.”\nTenik nodded to the captain. He and Michel headed into one of the\nsecond-floor offices on the opposite side of the warehouse, where Michel\npaced while he waited. Tenik leaned comfortably in the corner, flipping his\ncoin, obviously pleased to be out of the heat. “You’re going to try to turn\nher?”\n“I am.”\n“For over a month, we’ve been offering rewards for anyone who will\nturn. Why would she do so now?”\n“People don’t give up when they think they have options. Our dear\nBronze Rose is down to just two, and I’m going to make sure she knows it.”\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the door opening and a soldier\ncoming in with the Bronze Rose, whom he pushed to her knees in the\nmiddle of the floor. Her eyes went first to Tenik, then to Michel. She\nseemed confused to find a Palo and a mutt, rather than a Dynize torture\nsquad.\nMichel smiled at her gently, trying to recall her name. “Soreana, was it?”\nhe asked.\n“How do you know my name?”\n“Because I used to be a Blackhat.”\nThe information took a moment to process before her eyes widened.\n“You’re him, aren’t you? Michel. How the pit did you find us already?”\n“Because Lindet left a bunch of thugs behind, rather than spies.”\n“You’re a damned traitor.”\nShe wasn’t wrong. Michel kept his smile and tutted. “Let’s not be so\njudgmental this early on, shall we?”\nSoreana looked around the room, her eyes lingering on the Dynize\nsoldiers standing by the door. Michel could see the same thoughts ticking\nthrough her head that had gone through his own in a few tight situations—\nHow well tied are my bonds? How closely are they watching? Can I fight or\ntalk my way out of this? He didn’t give her a chance to consider those\noptions.\n“Soreana, do you know where I can find either Marhoush or je Tura?”\nhe asked.\nShe drew herself up—as best as she could while kneeling with hands"

If you’d like, you can play the good little Blackhat. If you do that,\nI’ll be forced to hand you over to the fine gentlemen outside, who will\ntorture you for every scrap of information and then execute you.”\nSoreana swallowed hard. The average Blackhat signed on to rough up\nneighborhood malcontents, not to embroil themselves in dangerous guerrilla\nwarfare.\n“Or,” Michel continued, “you can tell me what I want and I’ll make sure\nyour pockets are filled with gold. We’ll give you a job or put you on the\nnext ship to the Nine or give you a whole slew of other options.” Michel\nremoved his pocket watch and looked at the hands. “I’ll give you thirty\nseconds to decide.”\nSoreana looked from Michel to Tenik to the guard. She licked her lips.\n“Ten seconds left,” Michel told her.\n“I’ll be safe?” she asked.\nMichel smiled kindly. “I’ve eaten better since I switched sides than I\never did under the Blackhats. The brothels are better, the pay is better.” Not\nprecisely true, but a good enough set of lies for the moment. “Five\nseconds.”\nHe could see her waffling. He watched the last few seconds tick by,\nsilently willing her to talk, then dropped his watch back into his pocket\nwithout bothering to hide his annoyance. “Sorry, Soreana. Take her away.”\n“Wait!” She awkwardly surged to her feet, stumbling into the wall. “I’ll\ntake the offer. Please.”\nMichel glanced at Tenik, who shrugged as if to say, This is your game.\n“Yes?”\n“Just promise me that no one will find out I talked.”\n“I think that can be arranged. Where is je Tura?”\n“I don’t know where je Tura is, but I can tell you about Marhoush.”\n“Go on.”\n“He switched safe houses two nights ago. He moved to the house on\nKing’s Street in Lower Landfall. But you won’t find him there, not now.\nHe’s supposed to be meeting with someone important in an hour.”\nTenik visibly perked up. Michel took a step closer to her. “Who? Je\nTura?”\n“I’m not sure. I just know it’s supposed to be in Claden Park at four\no’clock. He’s been going to these meetings every other day for two weeks.”\n“All right.” Michel took a deep breath. This was the next link in the\nchain, but he’d have to move fast. Claden Park was clear on the other side\nof the plateau. “I’m going to find you later and get everything you know\nabout the Blackhats.

        "text": "downstairs thinks you’ve been executed. Give me your best scream.”\nThe fastest route across the plateau turned out to be surrounded by a dozen\nDynize soldiers on the backs of galloping horses. Michel clung to his saddle\nin terror as they rounded the western base of the plateau and then cut\nsoutheast. They arrived at Claden Park with just minutes to spare, which\nMichel used to get his feet back under him before borrowing a looking glass\nfrom one of the soldiers and scouting out the north end of the park.\nCladen was a bit of marshland that had, at one point, been part of a\nBrudanian lady’s estate. Early on in her life she’d filled in the marsh and\nhad it planted with willows and beech as a garden for her sickly husband.\nTheir great-grandson had bequeathed the land to the public—along with a\ngenerous endowment for policing and upkeep. Rumors had swirled for\nyears that local industrialists were leaning on Lindet to develop it, and\nMichel wondered what would happen to the land under Dynize rule.\nFor now, it was still a park about the size of six city blocks. Traffic\npassed through a narrow road running down the middle, and a few\nsquatters’ tents had popped up in the overgrown lawns. Michel swept the\nlooking glass back and forth until he saw a middle-aged man sitting on one\nof the benches, surreptitiously reading a newspaper.\n“Heads down,” he told the soldiers. “You need to look like you’re just\npassing by and not like you’re waiting for something. Do a circuit around\nthe park, then head down that street there”—he pointed to a street leading to\nthe industrial quarter—“and post someone at the corner to wait for my\nsignal.”\nMichel split from the group, Tenik in tow, and headed in the opposite\ndirection around the park.\n“Marhoush is waiting on the bench there—don’t look!” Michel told\nTenik. “Whoever he’s meeting hasn’t arrived yet, and will probably wait for\nyour soldiers to go before they approach.” Michel kept walking at a\nleisurely stroll. After he reached the midpoint, he stopped behind a tree and\nkicked at a rock, hands in his pockets like any loitering Palo on a hot\nafternoon. “Flip your coin,” he told Tenik.\nThey had to wait only a few moments before a figure approached\nMarhoush, sitting down on the bench next to him. Michel watched out of\nthe corner of his eye for a moment, then moved a few dozen yards down the\nroad to get a profile look of Marhoush’s contact. He slid the soldier’s\nlooking glass from his sleeve and held it up to his eye. He blinked, rubbed\nthe lens, and looked again.\nWithout a word, he handed the glass to Tenik.\nThe figure sitting next to Marhoush was one who had burned herself\ninto Michel’s memory a week earlier. She had a soft face and medium-\nlength red hair, and she lounged with a casual ease next to Marhoush. She\nwas dressed like a Palo in a low-quality brown cotton suit. It was, without a\ndoubt, Devin-Forgula.\n“Why is she meeting with a Silver Rose?” Michel whispered.\n“I have no idea.”\n“Do we bring her in?” Michel asked."

His face looked like he’d just eaten an\nunripe lime. “You’re certain that this Marhoush is still a loyal Blackhat?”\n“Mostly certain,” Michel replied.\n“Mostly.” Tenik chewed on the word. After a few moments, he said,\n“No. She is one of Sedial’s and if we make accusations we must be\nprepared to back them up. We take this to Yaret as soon as he can see us.”\nCHAPTER 20\nS\ntyke, Ka-poel, and Celine arrived in a tiny town called Granalia a few\ndays after leaving Tenny Wiles. Granalia was nestled between two forested\nhills in eastern Fatrasta, and though it was a long way from Landfall, it\nappeared to be abandoned as they came over the hill and rode down the\nmain street.\n“Ka-poel is going to teach me her sign language,” Celine told Styke\nproudly.\n“Oh?”\n“Yeah. That way she won’t have to write everything down. I can\ntranslate for her.”\n“And when did you decide that?”\n“This morning, when you were taking a piss.”\nStyke rolled his eyes. It would, he admitted, be useful to have a\ntranslator. Celine was a quick girl—she already knew Adran, plus a lot of\nPalo and Kez and a smattering of half a dozen other languages. He had little\ndoubt she would be able to pick up a sign language in no time.\nAs they drew closer, Styke was surprised to find signs of violence: doors\nhanging from broken hinges, smashed locks. He dismounted to examine a\nfew of the buildings, only to find the inside of the pub a mess of broken\nbottles. The general store was cleared of anything useful, as were all the\nhouses and shops. He found a half-eaten meal on more than one table and\nsniffed at the fly-covered contents. Whatever had happened here was recent.\n“They haven’t been gone for more than a couple of days,” Styke said as\nCeline followed him into one of the houses.\nShe frowned at the contents of the table. “I don’t like this town. I gives\nme the creeps.”\n“It’s just empty,” Styke told her. “Nothing here is going to hurt you.”\n“I didn’t say anything would hurt me,” Celine replied defiantly. “I just\nsaid it gives me the creeps.” She rubbed her arms, looking around, and\nfollowed closely when Styke went back outside. “How long do we have to\nstay?”\n“Until the Mad Lancers catch up. They should be here today, tomorrow\nat the latest.”\n“What if they already passed?”\n“I’d see signs of a thousand cavalry having passed through town.” Styke\nreturned to Amrec and rubbed his nose. He wouldn’t admit it, but the empty\ntown had unsettled him. They were far from Landfall—much closer to\nLittle Starland—and if the Dynize were raiding all the way up here, it\nmeant that Jackal’s spirits were right about the fall of the other big coastal"

Why take these\npeople?”\nOnly silence answered his question. Ka-poel touched her fingers to a\nspot on the ground and crossed over to Styke, showing him the gooey\nblackness on her fingertips. Blood, a couple days old. She seemed to feel at\nthe air with those two fingers, then led them around the back of the church\nto a small, fenced-off graveyard, where someone had neatly stacked half a\ndozen bodies like firewood.\nThe smell hit them as soon as they rounded the building, and Styke was\nsurprised he hadn’t caught it earlier. The corpses stank of shit and death,\ncoated in flies as thick as molasses. Piling them unburied in a graveyard\nseemed like someone’s idea of a twisted joke.\nStyke appreciated that kind of humor.\nKa-poel wiped the old blood off her hands on the grass, then cleaned her\nfingers with a handkerchief and pulled out her chalkboard. They did not\nresist, she wrote.\nThat was Styke’s first impression as well. He stepped over the graveyard\nfence to get a closer look and was surprised when Celine followed him.\nMaybe the place genuinely did spook her. Bodies, on the other hand, were\nsomething she’d grown used to.\nHe squatted beside the pile, running his eyes over them. If this had been\na normal raid, or a looting gone bad, the bodies would have been left where\nthey’d fallen, not stacked here in a bizarrely orderly fashion. These men and\nwomen had been executed—some with musket blasts to the back of the\nhead and others bayoneted to death. They hadn’t fought back.\nIt had to be the Dynize. But this town was much bigger than six people.\nWhy lead off the rest, but not these?\nKa-poel joined him, writing something on her slate. This is a Palo town.\n“So?” Styke asked.\nShe pointed at the corpses, forcing him to look once more. Slowly, it\ndawned on him. The dead were all Kressians. “So they killed the Kressians\nbut led away the Palo?”\nKa-poel nodded.\n“Why?”\nShe shook her head. A few moments passed, and she headed off on her\nown, poking around in the grass and walking into one of the nearby houses\n—no doubt looking for clues as to the fate of the town. Styke remained with\nthe bodies for a moment, studying them thoughtfully, then did a circuit of\nthe church.\nHe wandered through several more buildings in a half-hearted bid to\ndiscover a survivor before finally giving up and returning to the front stoop\nof the general store with an overlooked bottle of gin and a fresh horngum\nroot from the apothecary’s garden at the end of the street."

After a swig of gin the numbness spread\nto his back, hips, and ass to happily relieve so many weeks of riding\ntension. He leaned back on the stoop and offered the gin to Celine. She took\na sniff of the bottle, shaking her head.\nThe silence was interrupted by the sound of hooves in the distance. He\nlistened to them approach, waiting for the shout of one of Ibana’s scouts.\nBut there was no shout, and the hoofbeats grew louder. He frowned,\nlooking over at Celine. The sound was coming from the east. Unless Ibana\nhad found a shorter route, she should be coming from the north. “What kind\nof horse is that?” he asked Celine.\nShe tilted her head to listen. “It’s light,” she said. “Maybe an Angland\nracer?”\n“It’s not an Angland.” Styke got to his feet. The road from the east was\non the other side of the church. The problem that unsettled him was that he\ndid not recognize that hoofbeat, not entirely. It sounded like …\nHe rounded the church to spot a small group coming toward him on\nDynizian mounts. There were six of them—four men and two women—\nwearing regular Fatrastan traveling clothes and not outwardly armed. They\nhad the red hair and freckles, but their horses precluded them from being\nPalo. Styke felt the hair on the back of his head stand on end as they came\nto a stop on the other side of the graveyard, barely sparing a glance for the\npile of corpses.\n“Who are they?” Celine asked.\n“Go back to the horses,” Styke said. “Find Ka-poel. Both of you go to\nthe edge of town and wait for me.”\n“What do you …?”\n“Now!”\nCeline set off at a run. One of the horsemen broke off from the others\nand began to trot after her. Styke put himself in the man’s path. That seemed\nto be enough, as the rider simply switched his attention from Celine to\nStyke. All of the riders were staring at him.\n“Are you Ben Styke?” one of them asked in heavily accented Adran.\nThe woman speaking had a scar across her left eye. Whatever had caused it\nhad barely missed leaving her half-blind.\n“Who wants to know?” Styke slowly reached for his knife.\nThe man whose horse Styke had blocked pointed at Styke’s chest. He\nspoke in Dynize, but it was close enough to Palo that Styke could\nunderstand most of it. “Look at his size. He’s a crippled giant with gunshot\nwounds. Has to be him.”\n“Ji-Orz, go keep watch,” the woman with the scar said. One of the men\nbroke off and headed back the way they’d come, remaining on horseback\non a nearby hillock. “You are the man they call Ben Styke, correct?” she\nasked."

He took a\nhalf step back. The group was far too at ease to be soldiers. Styke could see\nthe bulge of knives beneath their coats, but none of them carried a firearm.\nHe tried to remember the Dynize title “Ji,” but he didn’t think he’d ever\nheard it before. “I am.”\nThe nearest one leaned over in his saddle, peering at Styke. “You think it\nwas just a story? I can’t imagine an old cripple like him killing Ji-Kushel.”\nStyke’s blood ran cold as he remembered the name. Kushel. The\ndragonman he’d killed in Lady Flint’s muster yard. “Ji” was the title for\ndragonmen. He felt a small bead of sweat break out on the back of his neck\nand wrapped his fingers around the hilt of his knife. Six dragonmen. Styke\nnearly died fighting one.\n“We were sent by Ka-Sedial,” the woman said, “to kill the man who\nmurdered one of our brothers in single combat. You killed Ji-Kushel?”\nStyke had the sinking feeling that he was about to die. He fought the\nfeeling, flinging it from his mind with a growing annoyance. Six\ndragonmen. Whoever this Ka-Sedial was, he had no intention of\nunderestimating Styke. “Yeah,” he said. “I killed him. I popped his head\nlike a zit.”\nOne of the other dragonmen snorted in derision. They glanced from one\nto the other, barely suppressing smirks. They didn’t seem all that worried\nthat Styke had murdered one of their comrades.\n“Ji-Matle,” the woman said, “go secure that girl.”\nJi-Matle flipped his reins, urging his mount forward into a casual trot\nthat belied any kind of urgency. He came abreast of Styke and looked down\nat him, shaking his head. “I still don’t believe it.”\nStyke stepped sidelong in front of the horse, jerking his head back from\nJi-Matle’s quickly drawn blade, and rammed his boz knife through the neck\nand up into the brain of the horse. It spasmed, and blood fountained from\nthe wound to cover Styke’s arms. He shoved, pushing the dying creature\nover as Ji-Matle leapt free with startling dexterity.\nThe dragonman landed in a crouch, looking at his horse in dismay.\n“You’re strong,” he noted, looking over his shoulder at his companions.\n“Finish him quickly,” the woman said, “and we can be back in Dynize\nby the end of the month.”\n“You really think they’re going to let us go home with a war on?” Ji-\nMatle asked.\n“We have Ka-Sedial’s word. Would you question that?”\n“Of course not.”\nDespite Styke’s display of strength, none of the dragonmen seemed at all\nconcerned about the danger.

The warmth of its blood felt slick between his fingers,\nand he whispered an apology.\n“Come now, Ben Styke, you have already killed my horse,” Ji-Matle\nsaid, gesturing with a bone knife.\n“I’ve got a knife like that,” Styke said, still kneeling by the horse. “It\nbelonged to your friend Kushel.”\nThe woman’s eyes narrowed. Ji-Matle looked to her once again, as if for\nguidance. “Where is that knife?” she asked.\n“Left it with a friend on the other side of the country,” Styke lied. “I just\nwant you to know that I used it to cut out Kushel’s tongue and eyes before\nhe died, then I took a shit in his mouth.”\nThe woman spat. “These Kressians are all damned savages. Kill him, Ji-\nMatle, and we will be gone.”\nJi-Matle frowned, appraising Styke for several seconds before darting\nforward and drawing a second knife. Styke caught sight of the dragonskin\narmor beneath his duster just as Ji-Matle leapt over the dead horse,\nswinging his knife downward.\nStyke whipped his left hand out of the horse’s neck, flinging warm blood\ninto Ji-Matle’s eyes and then rolling out of the way of the swipe. He came\nout of his roll and reversed directions as Ji-Matle barely managed to stick\nhis landing and stumble toward the graves. He dropped one of his knives,\npawing at his eyes. Styke ran at him on the balls of his feet, boz knife\nforward. Ji-Matle swiped blindly, slashing through the left arm of Styke’s\njacket, the blade biting into his skin. Styke did not slow, ramming his own\nknife into Ji-Matle’s groin and plowing him over.\nJi-Matle continued to struggle despite the life flowing out of him,\nreversing the grip on his knife and swinging for Styke’s side. Styke caught\nhim by the wrist and slammed Ji-Matle’s elbow against a marble\ngravestone, bone erupting from the skin. Ji-Matle refused to scream, still\nattempting to fight until Styke grabbed him by the face and smashed his\nhead against the same stone.\nThe fight was over in seconds. Styke dropped the crumpled figure at his\nfeet, fingers covered with blood, brain, and bits of skull. It seemed like his\nwhole body was slick with warm blood—from the horse and from Ji-Matle\n—and he turned to face the dragonmen.\nThey stared at him as if in disbelief, looking at him and at the corpse of\ntheir dead companion. The woman spoke. “Ka-Sedial was right not to\nunderestimate you, Ben Styke,” she said quietly. “Kill him.”\nThe word had barely left her mouth when a blast went off nearby and the\ntop of her head exploded.

She held Styke’s carbine in both of her\nhands. She trembled visibly, and immediately began to reload the carbine.\nSeveral things happened at once. First, the dragonmen began to move—\none toward Celine and two toward Styke. Celine dropped the carbine, and\nStyke began to run toward her, shouting over his shoulder, “Ka-poel, if\nyou’re done hiding, I could use some of that blood magic!”\nThe nearest dragonman froze. “What did he say? What name did you\nspeak?”\nThe dragonman keeping watch from nearby shouted, taking the attention\nof all three of his remaining companions. They suddenly turned their horses\nand beat a fast retreat toward the east, leaving Styke standing in bloody\nclothes to try and figure out what had scared them off.\nHe didn’t have to wait long. The sound of approaching riders came\nswiftly, and soon behind them the Mad Lancers rode out of the forest to the\nnorth with Ibana and Jackal at their front. Ibana joined Styke quickly,\nstaring at his clothes and the bodies of the dragonmen. “What happened?\nDo you want us to run them down?”\n“Not a great idea,” Styke said. The lancers might have a better chance\nagainst dragonmen with carbines at a distance, but he did not want them to\nget tied up in a forest against those bastards. “Keep everyone tight, and\ntriple the scout patrols.”\n“Who the pit were they?” Ibana asked. “And what happened to you?”\nStyke hurried toward Celine, calling over his shoulder, “They’re\ndragonmen, and they’ve been following us since Landfall. Apparently\nthey’ve been sent to kill me.” He reached Amrec and picked up his carbine,\nreturning it to the saddle. Celine looked distant and frightened.\nHe pulled her down, taking her in his arms. “It’s all right,” he told her.\n“I killed her.”\n“You did. It was a very good thing.”\nCeline blinked at the sky. “I didn’t like it.”\nStyke squeezed her gently and set her on her feet, only then realizing she\nwas now also covered in blood. He lifted her chin with one finger, laying\nhis other hand on her shoulder. “It’s okay. You never have to kill anyone\nwhen I’m around. Never again.”\n“But she would have killed you.” Her face hardened. “I didn’t like it, but\nI won’t let anyone kill you, Ben.”\n“I know,” Styke said gently.\nShe looked down at his arm. “You’re bleeding.”\n“That’s just horse blood. And human. But it’s his.”\nShe poked him, sending a jolt of pain up that arm. “It’s also yours.”\n“Right. I’ll get cleaned up in the river. Go find Sunintiel. Tell her you\nkilled a dragonman.

He said, “If they had rushed me, could\nyou have done anything?”\nShe shook her head.\n“That’s not very reassuring.” He paced from one end of the graveyard to\nthe other, walking off the adrenaline rush. Part of him knew that he very\neasily could have died. Another part rejoiced at fighting another real warrior\nlike that. The fight with Kushel had been drawn out. This had been short,\nbrutal, and satisfying. “Did you find out anything about the town?” he\nasked Ka-poel.\nShe shook her head.\nFrustrated, Styke paced the graveyard again. Maybe he should have sent\nthe lancers after those dragonmen. Losing even a hundred men would be\nworth not having four dragonmen prowling the countryside. He thought\nabout the woman Celine had shot and turned to Ka-poel.\n“ ‘Ka’ is the title for the bone-eyes, right?”\nOf the royal family, she wrote on her slate.\nThe implication was not lost on him. “So what are you, some kind of\nprincess?”\nAnother head shake.\n“Then what?”\nI don’t know, she wrote.\nStyke stared at her for several long seconds, hoping she’d give at least\nsome sort of elaboration. When none was forthcoming, he finally turned\naway to examine the passing column of lancers. None of them looked worse\nfor wear, which meant they hadn’t run into any trouble the last week. But\nthat, he was certain, was about to change.\nCHAPTER 21\nV\nlora, Taniel, and Little Flerring relocated to a small complex of cabins\ndeep in the forest on a gently sloped hillside. Flerring pointed at each of the\nbuildings as they passed, explaining their uses. Most of the buildings were\nused for the creation and storage of black powder, but a few stone huts way\nup the hillside away from all the others were set aside for the substance that\nhad made the Flerring family a household name throughout the Nine:\nblasting oil.\n“We do everything explosive,” she explained to Taniel as they headed up\na path to a cabin sheltered from all the others by a large boulder. “Black\npowder was our original trade, and still makes up the volume of our\nproduction. You’d be surprised at how many different mixes there are for\nmining applications. Explosive velocity, temperature, humidity—all these\nthings have to be taken into account when we decide the formula and\ngranule size.”\n“Just like mixing powder for military use,” Taniel said.\n“But far more complex!” Flerring declared. “Out here in the mountains,\nyou’ve got to be more careful. I’m handing explosives over to idiots from\nall over the world, most of whom have never even fired a gun, let alone\ndrilled into solid rock and detonated explosives in the hole. I’ve got to\nknow what kind of rock it is, the altitude, the depth of the mine.” She\nscoffed. “I do everything I can to make it simple for the miners, but people\nstill die every day.”\n“Is that why you’re here?” Vlora said. “I’m surprised you’re on-site,"

        "text": "still die every day.”\n“Is that why you’re here?” Vlora said. “I’m surprised you’re on-site,\nrather than one of your people.”\nFlerring made a sound in the back of her throat. “I’m on-site because\nI’m making a damned fortune selling these miners blasting oil.\nTransportation has been banned all over the Nine due to … accidents … so\nthe damned stuff has to be mixed in person. I wanted to do a little traveling\nanyway, so …” She shrugged and unlocked the cabin, ushering them inside.\nIt was cozy without being cramped, with space enough for perhaps a dozen\npeople to gather around a potbellied stove or half that many to enjoy a game\nof cards.\nFlerring stoked the fire and put on a kettle, then kicked her boots off.\n“So that’s why I’m here. You going to tell me what a dead war hero and a\ndecorated Adran general are doing in the armpit of Fatrasta?”\nVlora had been struggling with how much to actually tell Flerring. She\nwas perfectly trustworthy—after all, someone in the explosives business\nhas to know how to keep secrets to keep a leg up on her competitors—but\nthis wasn’t the kind of information she wanted spread around.\nTaniel gestured toward Vlora, as if to say, She’s your friend.\n“We’re looking for an artifact,” Vlora said. “You’ve heard about the\nwar?”\n“Everyone has,” Flerring replied. “Word just arrived the other day that\nLandfall fell. We’re so far off the beaten path that no one here wants to\nabandon their claim, but if the fighting swerves this way, my bags are\npacked.”\n“Right. Well, we’re looking for an artifact, an ancient bit of Dynize\nsorcery that should be floating around nearby.”\n“Is floating around nearby,” Taniel corrected.\nVlora went on. “This artifact is the reason the Dynize are invading. It\nhas both Lindet and the Dynize scrambling to find it.”\n“And you want to get to it first?”\nVlora glanced at Taniel, whose expression was unreadable. “We want to\ndestroy it,” she said.\n“Huh.” Flerring moved a few bits around on the table next to her until\nshe found a boning knife and began to pick her teeth with it. “What does it\ndo?”\n“It grants power,” Taniel said quickly. “Sorcerous power. The kind we\ndon’t want anyone to get their hands on.”\n“So you’re here to find it and blow it up?”\n“Maybe,” Vlora said hesitantly. “We have to find it, but we might have\nto figure out how to steal it. We tried blowing up a matching artifact outside\nof Landfall with enough black powder to level a city and it didn’t do shit.”\nFlerring snorted. “You military types think you know how to blow\nthings up properly.”\n“I’d like to see you do better,” Taniel said.\nFlerring sat forward as if intrigued. “I’m guessing by your presence that\nthis is a matter of the Adran Cabal?”\n“It is,” Vlora said.\n“Well, then, as a representative of the Adran government and for a small\nconsulting fee, I would be delighted to try.”"

The thought pleased her to no end, but there was a\nniggling feeling in the back of her head that not even Flerring’s blasting oil\ncould damage the powerful sorceries protecting the godstone. “Consider\nyourself hired. But we still have to find the thing.”\n“Not sure if I can help with that,” Flerring said. The kettle began to boil,\nand she got up and poured them each a cup of tea, then disappeared beneath\nthe floor and returned a moment later with a handful of shaved ice,\nplunking a bit in each cup. “I’ve been here a while. If someone had found a\nsorcerous artifact, I think I would have heard about it by now.”\n“Perhaps,” Taniel said. “It might be buried. It might be actively hidden.\nIf you’re willing to help us find it, we can do more than whatever the fee\nthe Adran government will give you.”\n“Fascinating.” Flerring continued to pick at her teeth with the knife, her\nface thoughtful. “It’s a bad time to ask questions, but I’ll see what I can do.”\n“What is going on?” Vlora asked, sipping her tea. “We got a little of it\nfrom the hotel manager. Some kind of power struggle?”\n“You could say that. Everyone wants the gold, but not everyone wants to\nwork for it. Now, when we talk about gold sniffers in Yellow Creek, you’ve\ngot freelance fools digging their own holes or panning for gold in the\nstreams, and you’ve got hired fellas. The hired fellas work for one of two\nbosses, and those bosses own all the big claims in the surrounding hills.”\nShe held up two fingers. “There’s Jezzy, the owner of the Pink Saloon. Her\nboys are called the Shovels. Then there’s Brown Bear Burt. He’s a Palo out\nof Redstone who made a fortune selling family land to Lindet after his\nwhole tribe died to disease. Burt’s hired fellas call themselves the Picks.”\nVlora leaned back, trying to take it all in, rubbing her eyes. “Don’t these\nguys know there’s a war on?”\n“You try to tell a desperate man he should abandon his claim to possible\nriches and he will gut you seven ways from sundown.” Flerring sighed.\n“Some of the independent miners are getting smart—selling their claims or\nclosing things off to wait out the war. But not Jezzy and Burt. Those two are\nlocked in a feud for control of the mines and won’t let up till one of them is\ndead or the Dynize roll into town to claim the whole lot.”\n“We might be able to use this to our advantage,” Taniel said\nthoughtfully. “With all this chaos, we need to find the artifact and get out of\nhere before Lindet even knows where we are.”\n“Seems like a good call.” Flerring spat on the floor. “You know that\nbitch tried to kidnap me?

Had some muscle up here six months ago trying\nto take me to Landfall. Had to run them off with a couple vials of blasting\noil, then make it clear to her that if she ever wants to do business with the\nFlerring Company, she will wait until I come to her.”\n“I’ve met Lindet,” Vlora said. “I can’t imagine she took that well.”\nFlerring spat again, then finished her tea. “I don’t care how she took it.\nBrute force has no place in the business of explosives, no matter how\nincongruous that may seem. It’s all careful, planned, and gentle.” She\nsquinted toward the window, nodding to herself. “Sun’s going down. I need\nto do my rounds before dark, and you should get back to town.”\nShe walked them to their horses and then said good-bye before heading\nto one of the outbuildings.\nVlora and Taniel returned to their hotel just at dark and had dinner in the\ngreat room. The food was better than road rations—barely—with watered-\ndown beer and unidentifiable meat. They spoke quietly about Flerring and\ntheir search for the stone.\n“I figure,” Vlora said as they finished eating, “we have two or three\nweeks until Olem gets here with the army. Those hills and narrow roads are\ngoing to slow them down, and I told him to take it easy. If luck is with us,\nwe can find the stone and figure out a way to destroy or move it before they\narrive. We sneak in a group of men and we can be out of here without\nhaving to bring in the army.”\nTaniel’s eyes roamed the great room. “Lots of armed men,” he said. “If it\ncomes to a fight, they won’t stand a chance against the Riflejacks, but the\nlast thing we need is locals seeing an army and digging in. They’ll slow us\ndown. We keep our own heads down while we search. Don’t let anyone\nknow who we are.

Vlora felt the corner of her mouth tug upward, and\nshe found herself happy to see that Taniel still enjoyed his old hobby. She\nremembered posing with Bo and Tamas as a child, while Taniel—face\nserious—forced them all to sit still for hours while he perfected his charcoal\ndrawings.\nShe didn’t pry, but a glimpse at the pages as he flipped them told her that\nhe’d gotten much better since then.\n“That,” Taniel said, nodding across the room, “is a funny-looking man.”\nHe opened to a fresh page and began to sketch.\nVlora would have loved to stay and watch him work, but she needed\nsome time alone to think—and a full night’s sleep would do her damned\ngood.

She fetched a bottle of wine from the barkeep and headed upstairs,\ngently tapping each door as she passed it until she reached the number that\nmatched her room key. Rubbing her eyes, she stepped inside and closed the\ndoor behind her.\nShe was surprised, when she blinked through her tired haze, to find the\nroom already occupied. Three men waited in the room—all of them big, all\nof them heavily armed, and all of them with the kind of grizzled faces that\nlooked like they’d been run over by a brigade of cuirassiers. One stood by\nthe window, one leaned against the wall, and one reclined on her bed,\ngrinning at her in what he must have thought was a friendly manner.\nVlora took them all in sourly. Her saddlebags sat next to the bed, so this\nwasn’t the wrong room. “I paid for clean linens, asshole,” she told the one\non the bed.\nThe man’s grin faded and he stood up, crossing the small room to tower\nabove her. “What’s your name?” he demanded.\nVlora looked up at him and resisted the urge to cut his throat. People\ndidn’t loom like that unless they were trying to intimidate, and her height\nmeant she had to deal with confident, tall idiots all the time. She could kill\nall three of them before they could draw their swords, but now was not the\ntime or the place. “Can I help you gentlemen with something?”\n“Back off, Dorner,” the man by the wall said. Dorner, Vlora noted, was a\nBrudanian name. The man continued. “We were told a pair of mercenaries\nhad checked into the hotel this afternoon, and were unaware of the\ncircumstances surrounding the, uh, local politics.”\nThe last two words made Vlora want to punch him really hard. Instead,\nshe forced a smile on her face. “And what are you doing in my room?”\n“Recruiting,” the one called Dorner said in a deep growl. “You’re\nunaligned, and nobody in this town with a sword is allowed to be\nunaligned.”\n“And which one of these clubs do you idiots belong to?” Vlora asked.\nShe leaned back against the door, slumping casually, her hands within easy\nreach of both her weapons.\nDorner drew himself up. “We’re Jezzy’s Shovels, and if you know\nwhat’s good for you, you’ll sign up with us tonight.”\n“What Dorner means,” the man leaning on the wall said, “is that Jezzy\npays the best, and she’s not a greasy Palo. We’ll pay a hundred a week for\nyour sword and we’ll give you a place to bunk.”\nVlora pretended to consider. “Not interested,” she finally said.\nDorner loomed closer. “Excuse me?”\n“I said I’m not interested. I came up here for some easy work guarding a\nmine or a caravan. This city is hot as a powder barrel over a fire and I’m not\ninterested in getting into some stupid turf war.”\n“Listen, bitch,” Dorner growled, “you’re either with us or against us.\nYou can—”\nVlora’s palm hit him beneath the chin, snapping his neck back and"

He stumbled back, crimson pouring out of his\nmouth. He spat half his tongue onto the floor and immediately began to\nscream, pawing at his face.\nThe man by the window rounded the bed, drawing a cudgel, but even\nwithout a powder trance Vlora was faster. She punched him hard in the gut,\ndoubling him over, then slammed his head against the wall hard enough to\nput him out cold. In the same motion she drew her pistol, pointing it at the\nman leaning against the wall. His hand fell away from his sword.\n“You tell your boss,” Vlora said, “that I’m not interested in playing in a\nturf war. I don’t give a shit about your sides, and I’d like to be left alone\nuntil I see fit to check out of this fine establishment. Is that civilized enough\nfor you?”\nThe man raised his hands, palms out. “I get it, I get it.”\n“You were polite, so I’m not gonna smash your face in. Take your\nasshole friends and get out.”\nThe man pushed his now tongueless companion out the door, leaving so\nquickly that they forgot their third member lying unconscious on the floor.\nVlora stared down at the prone figure and sighed, putting her pistol back in\nher belt. She reached down and took him by the hair, dragging him out the\ndoor and down the hall, then down the stairs while the entire great hall\nwatched in silence.\nTaniel sat in the corner, head in his hands, while Vlora dragged the body\nup to the manager’s podium. The squirrelly little man stared at her, eyes\nwide. “Is … is … is … there something I can do for you, ma’am?” he\nstuttered.\n“You can leave this guy somewhere until he wakes up,” Vlora said. “He\nshouldn’t be out more than a minute or two. Send someone up to my room\nwith fresh linens and to clean the blood and the bit of tongue off my floor.”\nVlora took a handkerchief out of her pocket and wiped the red spatter off\nher face.\n“Did you say ‘tongue’?”\n“I did.

It was a disquieting\nfeeling, fueling an indignant rage that kept him from being able to sleep.\nThe flaps of his tent were thrown back, breaking him out of his\nmeditation, and Ibana’s face appeared in the opening. “Have a minute?” she\nasked.\nStyke joined her by the coals of the fire, map still in hand. “You should\nsleep,” he said.\n“Too much to do. You?”\n“Harder to sleep since the labor camps.” Styke tapped one finger on the\nback of his Lancers’ ring and changed the subject. “How did your ride go?\nDoesn’t look like you saw any action.” It was the first time they’d had a\nchance to talk since their arrival had saved him from the dragonmen, and he\nneeded to catch up.\n“We didn’t,” Ibana confirmed. “We saw three armies—two Fatrastan\nand one Dynize—and a dozen scouting parties. But we managed to steer\nclear of any trouble. One thing of note: Lindet’s armies are stripping the\nland. Every town between here and Landfall that hasn’t been looted by the\nDynize is being hit by Fatrastans. They’re taking harvests, emptying\ngranaries, stealing wagons, weapons, and animals. Anything of use to the\nwar effort is being swept up.”\n“Conscription?”\n“Everyone healthy between fourteen and sixty.”\n“Pit.” Styke didn’t like the idea of conscription. Forcing someone to\nfight didn’t make them a warrior. But beyond his personal ideals, the fact\nthat Lindet had already turned to conscription meant that she was worried\nabout this war. “Next time you see soldiers stealing from Fatrastan citizens,\nstring them up.”\nIbana’s eyebrows rose.\n“What’s the point in fighting for people who will starve before winter?”\nIbana responded, “Lindet would argue that every resource left behind is\none the Dynize will snatch up.”\n“Then Lindet damn well needs to guard her citizens better.” Styke had a\nsmall sense of understanding: The Dynize landing all along the coast meant\nLindet had to pick her battles. This was as bad or worse than the\nRevolution. But that didn’t make it right. “You’re recruiting?”\n“Anyone who is strong enough to ride and hold a lance.”\n“They know what we’re really up to?”\n“They know that they’ll be left behind if they don’t follow orders. We\nadded about a hundred and fifty to our numbers since you left to deal with\nTenny Wiles.”\n“Good enough, I suppose,” Styke said.\nIbana watched him sidelong. “How did that go, by the way?”\n“It went well.”\nIbana opened her mouth as if to ask further, but something in Styke’s\ntone must have warned her away. She took the map, rolling it out on her\nlap. “We’ve got some news from our scouts.”\n“Yeah?”\nShe paused, looking Styke in the eye. “Do you really believe Jackal and\nhis muttering about spirits?”\n“What does that have to do with our scouts?”\n“Just answer the question.”"

        "text": "“Yeah?”\nShe paused, looking Styke in the eye. “Do you really believe Jackal and\nhis muttering about spirits?”\n“What does that have to do with our scouts?”\n“Just answer the question.”\n“I have more evidence to believe him than not,” Styke replied.\n“Well, I don’t. It’s a lot of horseshit.”\n“Then why do you ask?”\nShe hesitated again, clearly frustrated. “Because he was right.” She drew\nher finger along the map. “The coasts are in flames. Every major city and\nmost of the small ones are either captured or under siege. Little Starland is\ndefinitely gone, just like Jackal told us a week ago. Swinshire is captured,\ntoo.”\n“Shit,” Styke said. Swinshire was on one of two major routes from the\ncenter of Fatrasta out onto the sliver of land on the west coast they called\nthe Hammer. They’d planned on swinging through Swinshire to pick up\nnews, a day of rest, some recruitment, and a major resupply before their\nfinal push toward whatever awaited them near the godstone.\nThat meant they had one option left—Bellport—and Styke wasn’t sure\nhe was ready for that. Valayine, the third of the men who’d betrayed him to\nFidelis Jes, was rumored to be in Bellport. Since letting Tenny Wiles go,\nStyke had wanted more time to consider his actions before another\nconfrontation.\n“Bellport it is, then,” he said.\n“Bellport it is,” Ibana agreed, rolling up the map. “You figure out what\nyou want to do about those dragonmen?”\nStyke cursed them under his breath. Their mere presence complicated\nthings, let alone the fact that they wanted to kill him. “Did you triple the\nsize of our scouting patrols?”\n“I did, but no one has seen hide nor hair of them since they fled\nGranalia.”\nStyke remembered the dragonman in Landfall. He’d been an arrogant\nprick, acting like he could take on an army and win. Styke had now seen\ntwo of them fight, and his victories had come from brute force that few\ncould match. He had no doubt that four dragonmen, if they were so\ninclined, could make life miserable for the lancers.\nBut would they? They’d taken great pains to come after him when he\nwas isolated. Perhaps they didn’t want the risk of fighting a whole army.\n“Not much we can do until they show their faces again,” Styke said.\n“Drill the men and make sure they know exactly what we’re dealing with. I\ndon’t need dozens dead because they underestimate the enemy. With any\nluck, they’ll keep their distance when we reach Bellport.” Styke ran a hand\nthrough his hair, listening to Celine’s snoring in the next tent over. “Drill\nthe men for an extra hour tomorrow. You’re still using that buddy system?”\n“It’s working pretty well, I think,” Ibana answered.\n“Good. I’m going to try to get some sleep. If you see Ka-poel, tell her\nwe’re going through Bellport instead of Swinshire.”\nStyke watched Ibana drill the men the next morning, enjoying the way the\nhorses raced back and forth across the meadow.

        "text": "we’re going through Bellport instead of Swinshire.”\nStyke watched Ibana drill the men the next morning, enjoying the way the\nhorses raced back and forth across the meadow. He waffled between\nfrustration and amusement when volunteers fell from their saddles or\ndropped their lances, but was definitely annoyed to see Major Gustar and\nthe Riflejacks were showing up the old lancers.\nThey rode out of their camp just after noon with a wind at their backs\nand the sun high in the sky. Smoke rose in a pillar above some town far to\ntheir south, and the road was clear for as far as the eye could see.\nStyke paused on Amrec, looking back toward the place they’d spent the\nnight, and spotted figures in the distance. Curiosity got the better of him and\nhe removed his looking glass, directing it toward the strangers. They were\nfar enough away that he couldn’t make out any details beyond the fact that\nthere were four of them and they were on horseback. They weren’t wearing\nDynize breastplates or yellow Fatrastan jackets.\nThey sat still, watching as the Mad Lancers marched down the road\nbefore slowly beginning to follow. Styke briefly considered sending a\nplatoon to run them down, but rejected the idea. He’d either wind up with a\nslaughtered platoon of lancers or waste everyone’s time. The dragonmen\nweren’t going to be seen unless they wanted to be seen.\nThe Dynize bastards, Styke decided, would be harder to lose than he\nhoped. Troubled, he put away his looking glass and urged Amrec to catch\nup with the rest of the lancers.\nCHAPTER 23\nM\nichel wasn’t able to see Yaret until the day after he spotted Forgula\nmeeting with Marhoush. Michel expected to return to the capitol building,\nwhere he’d meet with Yaret in one of the enormous offices upstairs. Instead,\nTenik led him to a street a few blocks over from the capitol building, where\na row of townhouse mansions lay within an easy walk of the engine of\ngovernment.\nThe street was full and lively, packed with Dynize dressed in military\nuniforms and civilian clothing, and it quickly became apparent that the\nDynize elite had simply moved into the homes formerly owned by their\nFatrastan counterparts.\nThe Yaret Household was headquartered in one of the smaller\ntownhouses at the far end of the street. It was a strange sight: Soldiers\nflanked the front doorway, while a pair of redheaded children played in the\nnarrow garden out front and restless teenagers loitered on the sidewalk.\nTenik scattered the teens with a sharp word and led Michel past the soldiers\nto the front hall, where Michel found a bustling household.\n“Household,” it turned out, was an apt word for Yaret’s power base.\nDynize of all ages filled the halls and rooms. Michel, with his limited\nDynize vocabulary, overheard conversations involving political strategy,\neconomic speculation, war projections, and plenty of gossip as he was led\ndown the halls and up to a door on the second floor.\n“Is this Yaret’s family?” Michel asked in a low voice as Tenik rapped on\nthe door.\nThey both looked back down the hall at a pair of thirty-somethings\nsharing a cigarette and openly lambasting a rival family whose name"

        "text": "the door.\nThey both looked back down the hall at a pair of thirty-somethings\nsharing a cigarette and openly lambasting a rival family whose name\nMichel hadn’t caught. “Yaret’s Household,” Tenik corrected. “Family has\nimportance in our culture, but Household comes first. Everyone in this\nbuilding is loyal to Yaret through blood, action, or political ties.”\n“How big is the Household?”\n“Here? A few hundred, if you don’t include active soldiers.”\n“And back in Dynize?”\n“Tens of thousands.”\nMichel let out a low whistle and wondered if every other house on this\nstreet had the same flurry of activity. He couldn’t voice the question before\nhe heard a muffled sound from inside the room and Tenik swung the door\nopen.\nYaret’s office seemed to be the only room in the house with a single\noccupant. It was a large room constructed in the current Fatrastan fashion\nwith deep, built-in bookshelves, a wide window, and an immense desk. The\nwindow was open to allow a southerly breeze and the desk had been shoved\nto one side and replaced in the center of the room with a pair of lounging\ncouches.\nYaret stood in front of one of the bookshelves. He spared Michel a\nglance, then removed a book from the shelf and flipped through it for a\nmoment before tossing it on a large pile in the corner. “I’m amazed at the\nrubbish you people stack on your shelves just to look intelligent,” he\ncommented. “There are histories, encyclopedias, medical texts, sex\nmanuals. Very few of these books have ever been cracked, let alone\nstudied.”\n“You should see my mother’s house,” Michel said offhand. He\nimmediately bit his tongue, wishing he hadn’t said that. Admitting to a\nliving mother was a piece of information that enemies could use against\nhim.\nYaret raised an eyebrow. “She likes books?”\n“Loves them, sir.” Michel cleared his throat. “Mostly penny novels. She\nlikes adventures.”\n“Does she read them?”\n“Every single one. Many times.”\n“Then she chooses better books than the fool who owned this library.”\nYaret tossed another book on the pile. “I don’t keep books unless I intend\non reading them. Seems like a waste of money, space, and resources.” He\ngestured at Tenik. “You’re welcome to look through those and see if there’s\nanything you want for the Household library back home.”\n“Thank you,” Tenik said with a nod. He seemed pleased with the\nallowance, and Michel wondered if such an act was a special privilege. At\nthis point, he understood just enough about Household dynamics to know\nhow little he actually grasped.\nYaret discarded one more book and walked to one of the couches. He lay\ndown, propping his head up with one arm, and examined Michel with a sort\nof idle curiosity that nearly made him squirm. After a few moments Yaret\nsaid, “I understand you have information for me. Have you found the Gold\nRose?”\nMichel cleared his throat, trying to collect the proper words to explain a\nweek of watching a building with nothing to show for it. He decided to tell\nit straight. “We’ve been following a man named Marhoush for a week,” he"

        "text": "week of watching a building with nothing to show for it. He decided to tell\nit straight. “We’ve been following a man named Marhoush for a week,” he\nreported. “Marhoush is the second-in-command to a Gold Rose named Val\nje Tura, who I believe has remained in the city.”\n“And you hoped Marhoush would lead you to this Tura?”\n“Je Tura,” Michel corrected the vernacular gently. “Yes, that is what we\nhoped.”\n“And has it?”\n“It hasn’t,” Michel answered.\nYaret’s eyes flicked to Tenik with a clear unspoken question. Michel\ntook that as his cue to forge ahead before Yaret could make assumptions\nabout complete failure.\nMichel said, “Marhoush didn’t lead us to je Tura, but he did lead us to\nsomeone equally intriguing.”\n“Intriguing or useful?” Yaret asked, using the Adran word for both.\n“ ‘Intriguing’ is the best term,” Tenik said, stepping in. “But I think it\ncould be useful.”\n“Well?” Yaret asked Michel.\nMichel hesitated. In the Blackhats, he would have done his due diligence\nbefore such a meeting. He would have found out Forgula’s friends and\nenemies, whom she was useful to, and why. He would have known ahead of\ntime whether her meeting with an enemy of the state was a surprise, a\ngiven, or something else. In short, he’d have a pretty good idea how Yaret\nwould react to the news and whether it needed to be sugarcoated or spun.\nBut Dynize politics was still an unknown, as was Yaret himself.\n“We saw Marhoush meeting with Forgula,” Michel said. “We weren’t\nclose enough to overhear the conversation, and Tenik didn’t think we\nshould bring them in for questioning.”\nYaret glanced at Tenik, who gave a small nod. “Well.” Yaret tapped his\nchin. “One of Sedial’s cupbearers meeting with an enemy of the state. That\nis intriguing.” Yaret paused to sweep his eyes across the half-empty\nbookshelf on the other side of the room. “You were right not to bring them\nin. What do you make of this, Michel?”\nMichel was surprised to be asked. This was no longer his territory. He\nsimply didn’t know enough about the Dynize to create an informed opinion.\nBut that wouldn’t keep him from trying. “I’m not certain,” he began. “It’s\npossible that Ka-Sedial has turned Marhoush and that Forgula is the\nintermediary. It’s also possible that je Tura is negotiating some kind of deal\n—again with Forgula as the intermediary.”\n“Or …?” Yaret asked. The question was a single word, but it held, at\nleast in Michel’s mind, a world full of menace.\nHow, he wondered, did the Dynize react to accusations of treason among\ntheir own people? “Or,” he finally said, “Forgula has been turned by the\nBlackhats.”\n“Forgula is Sedial’s creature through and through,” Tenik said quietly. “I\ndon’t think she would betray either him or the emperor.”\n“I agree,” Yaret said, sitting up and leaning toward Michel. “But it’s also\na possibility that we can’t entirely eliminate.”"

Sedial oversees the military and\nthe temporary government on the emperor’s behalf. I do not—”\nYaret was cut off by a rap on the door. He nodded to Tenik, who opened\nit to reveal one of the youths Michel had noticed loitering in the hall earlier.\n“Pardon, Minister,” the girl said, “but Ka-Sedial is here to see you.”\n“Now?” Yaret asked with some surprise.\n“He is at the door, sir.”\n“Send him in.” As soon as the door closed, Yaret stood and straightened\nhis pants and jacket, rolling his eyes. “Do you have demons in any of the\nKressian religions?” he asked.\n“We do,” Michel answered curiously. “Uh, should we go, sir?”\n“There’s an old saying in Dynize: Speak a demon’s name and he will\nappear. No, I’d like you to remain.” Yaret cleared his throat and clasped his\nhands behind his back, smiling at the door. Tenik took Michel by the arm\nand pulled him to one side just as the door opened.\nMichel had heard more than a few things about Ka-Sedial’s singular\nmeeting with Lindet just before the invasion began. Sedial was rumored to\nbe an old man, but Michel had not expected him to be in his late seventies,\nwearing a teal cloak over a comfortable-looking maroon tunic. Sedial\nwalked with a cane, though it was not clear if he actually needed it, and he\nhad a grandfatherly but slightly hawkish face, with sharp eyes and smile\nlines in the corners of his mouth.\nIf Ka-Sedial noticed Michel and Tenik standing to the side, he did not\ngive any indication. “My friend,” he said warmly to Yaret, taking Yaret’s\noffered hand in both of his.\n“Good afternoon, Sedial,” Yaret said in a gentle tone. “I didn’t expect\nyour visit. I apologize for the mess.”\n“Oh, no need. I’ve been cleaning the bookshelves in my own new home.\nSo much Kressian and Fatrastan rubbish. It’s a pity they wasted so much\npaper!”\nThe two men shared a laugh as if they were old friends. Michel watched\nthe sides of their faces carefully, and despite the warmth of their\nconversation he thought he spotted a glint in the eyes of each man.\n“My friend,” Sedial said, wiping an imaginary tear from his eye, “I was\njust passing by, but the truth is that a grave matter has been weighing on me\nfor several days.”\nYaret spread his arms. “If there’s anything I can do …”\n“There is.” Ka-Sedial’s face hardened. The change was almost\nimmediate, like an actor switching masks in the middle of a street\nperformance. The grandfatherly look was gone, replaced by severity\nchiseled out of marble. “I want the Gold Rose.”\nMichel couldn’t help but frown.

He wasn’t certain how much\ncommunication went on between the Dynize ministers and their\nHouseholds, but it made sense that Ka-Sedial would know about Yaret’s\nquest for Lindet’s spies. Did he really micromanage this badly, or was there\nsomething more sinister going on?\nMichel saw Yaret’s body tense slightly, but Yaret continued as if he had\nnot noticed the change in Ka-Sedial’s expression. “We’re making progress\non our search,” he said assuringly. “We believe we’re looking for a man\nnamed Val je Tura. Unless …” He paused. “If you’re looking for the item\nwe used to open the third floor of the Blackhat archives, I believe the\nminister of artifacts has it now.”\n“I’m not interested in the artifact,” Ka-Sedial said, “nor this supposed je\nTura. I want your pet Blackhat. The one who gave you the Rose.”\nMichel heard his own sharp intake of breath and fought to suppress the\nsudden hammering of his heart. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tenik\nglance at him with concern, while Yaret and Sedial ignored the noise as if\nhe were a piece of furniture. Michel barely trusted himself to breathe,\nwaiting for the moment Yaret pointed in his direction and ordered Sedial’s\nbodyguards to haul Michel off. Michel did not know much about Sedial, but\nTaniel’s warnings about the bone-eyes still echoed in his mind. And he still\nhad the bruises from Forgula’s beating.\n“Whatever for?” Yaret asked curiously.\n“Because he’s a spy,” Ka-Sedial replied, as if that were all the reason in\nthe world.\n“Yes, I’m aware he’s a spy. That’s why he’s valuable.”\n“He’s still a spy.”\n“Ah.” Yaret seemed to consider this as if it were new information. “I\nthink I see where the confusion is. You believe he’s still working for the\nenemy?”\nKa-Sedial gave the cold smile of someone who knew that Yaret was\nacting a fool but could not think of a way to politely break the facade. “I\nbelieve that is the case, yes. Some of my Household are concerned that\nyou’ve given him too much trust too quickly.”\n“Oh? I had no idea that the way I run my Household was under\nscrutiny.”\n“I—”\nYaret continued before Ka-Sedial could interject. “If my Household is\nunder imperial review, I would like to know immediately. If it is not, I\nwould like to know why your underlings are watching me. The amount of\ntrust I put in someone I’ve welcomed into my Household is entirely up to\nme.” Yaret’s voice continued in a gentle manner, but there was a new bite to\nhis words.\n“You’re not under imperial review,” Ka-Sedial reassured him.\n“I’m glad to hear that.”\n“But I’d like you to consider handing over the Gold Rose for\nquestioning.”\n“He gave us entry to the Blackhat library.”\n“True.

He wondered\nwhether Ka-Sedial knew that the man they were discussing was literally in\nthe room. Sedial had given no indication. The thought concerned Michel,\nand he wondered if Yaret had known this conversation was coming—and if\nso, why Yaret wished him to stay in the room for it.\nYaret’s genteel facade finally broke. “I will not hand over a member of\nmy Household to be tortured.”\n“He’s hardly a member of your Household already,” Ka-Sedial scoffed.\n“He is,” Yaret insisted. “He proved his usefulness when he gave us the\nMillinery library. He is one of dozens of Blackhats that my people have\nmanaged to turn over the last month. Not only is he already the most\nvaluable of those, but he has given me no reason to suspect that he’s a\ndouble agent. He’s actively working with my people to hunt down his\nformer companions.”\n“And you truly trust him?”\n“ ‘Truly’? Trust is a sliding scale, Sedial. He has begun the journey of\nearning my trust in good faith. I will not break that faith.”\nKa-Sedial’s hardened expression took on an air of annoyance. He was\nclearly a man used to being given what he asked for. For his own part,\nMichel was shocked that he hadn’t been handed over already. “He need not\nbe tortured,” Sedial said.\n“I won’t give him to the bone-eyes, either,” Yaret said.\nMichel tried not to panic at the idea. Ka-Sedial said, “You could oversee\nthe questioning. All we have to do is make sure he’s spilled all his secrets.\nIf he has, he can return to your Household. No harm done.”\n“You and I have very different definitions of ‘harm,’” Yaret said quietly.\n“But I think you already knew that.”\nKa-Sedial watched Yaret for several moments. His face was still merely\nstern, but his eyes spoke of a bottled fury. “Don’t let our past disagreements\ncloud your judgment, my friend.”\n“And don’t let your reliance on your sorcery cloud yours,” Yaret\nretorted. He spread his arms. “You control the military and the government.\nIf you try to manage even more, you will run yourself into an early grave.\nNone of us wants that, so I suggest you leave the espionage to me.”\nKa-Sedial snorted. “Think on my request,” he said before turning toward\nthe door. He paused halfway through his turn, eyes locking on Michel and\nTenik as if noticing their presence for the first time. He gave a slight frown\nand opened the door. Before he could go, Michel spotted a figure standing\ndown the hallway—a striking young woman wearing Privileged’s gloves.\nShe was obviously waiting for Ka-Sedial, greeting him with a nod as he\nemerged. For some reason her presence seemed to drive the danger of this\nsituation home to Michel; the realization that he could be destroyed by two\ndifferent sorceries or any number of mundane ways made everything just a\nlittle more terrifying.\nThe door closed and Michel found himself alone with Yaret and Tenik\nagain. He glanced between the two of them, his throat dry. No one spoke."

        "text": "little more terrifying.\nThe door closed and Michel found himself alone with Yaret and Tenik\nagain. He glanced between the two of them, his throat dry. No one spoke.\nAfter nearly a minute, Michel cleared his throat. “Thank you,” he said.\nYaret looked up from his own deep thoughts. “Hmm?”\n“Thank you for not turning me over to them. I have no desire to be\ntortured, or subjected to sorcery.”\n“Ah, yes.” Yaret waved off the thanks. “You are a member of my\nHousehold, no matter how early or tenuous. If I make a precedent of\nhanding my people over to a rival Household, it will make it clear to\neveryone that I am no longer fit to be a Minister.”\nMichel waited for an ominous follow-up. Something like, Don’t make\nme regret this decision, or Betray me and I will kill you myself. It never\ncame. Instead, Yaret frowned at the door for a few more moments before\nsaying, “Do you know why I asked you to remain in the room?”\n“You wanted to show me that you protect the people who work for\nyou?”\nYaret gave a genuine chuckle. “Nothing so serious, though I do make a\npoint of doing so … No, I did it to annoy Sedial. He’s a prick, Michel, and I\ndon’t really give a shit who knows it.”\nA long, awkward silence filled the room. Michel had the sudden\nrealization that he’d just backed the underdog in a struggle he hadn’t known\nwas going on. Yaret might have resources, but Sedial was in charge. This …\ncouldn’t be good. “I think he’s up to something, sir.”\n“Sedial is always up to something.”\nMichel tried to piece together the fragments he had gleaned from his\nweek with Tenik. “His underlings are meeting with a Silver Rose in secret.\nThey tried to intercept me when I defected. I … sir, I know it’s not my place\nto say it, but if spying and counterespionage is your purview, Sedial is\ndefinitely making a play for your power.”\nYaret and Tenik shared a long look, and Yaret gave a sigh. “You’re not\nsaying anything I don’t already know.”\n“Doesn’t he have enough power?” Tenik asked. “He is emperor in all but\nname.”\n“It is not quite that bad,” Yaret said with a gentle rebuke. He turned to\nMichel with an apologetic smile. “I realize you are getting a very swift—\nand possibly dangerous—introduction to our world. If you would like to\nremain with my Household but avoid the current scheming, I can send you\nback to Dynize.”\nMichel was surprised at the offer. He’d never had a superior extend an\noffer of safety before—every day was always about what Michel could do\nto further the cause, no matter the danger. Yaret seemed to have a different\nrespect for human life than Michel was used to. Funny enough, safety in\nDynize would destroy Michel’s plans completely. “I believe I can handle it,\nsir. I promised to be useful in exchange for hostages. I’m not going to give\nthat up.”\n“Good,” Yaret said, giving Michel a tight smile. “Unfortunately, there"

        "text": "sir. I promised to be useful in exchange for hostages. I’m not going to give\nthat up.”\n“Good,” Yaret said, giving Michel a tight smile. “Unfortunately, there\nare too many tasks and too few people to do them. I don’t mind telling you\nthat I need someone with your skills right now.”\n“Tell me how I can help,” Michel said. The farther I climb, the better\nchance I have of getting access to your records, he added to himself\nsilently.\n“I need you to keep looking for this je Tura, but I also want to know why\nForgula is meeting with the Blackhats. Tenik will give you whatever\nassistance we can spare, including men to follow the Silver Rose.”\n“I’ll get right on it, sir,” Michel promised. He waited for a nod of\ndismissal, then headed toward the door. He stopped with one hand on the\nknob, turning back. “Sir, I don’t mean to question fortune, but this seems …\nimportant. Why do you trust me with this already?”\nYaret chewed on the inside of his cheek, once again looking at the\nbookshelf he’d been in the midst of cleaning out. “Like I said, there are too\nfew people to do too many tasks.”\nTenik took Michel by the elbow and pulled him out into the hall, which\nhad emptied since Sedial’s departure. Michel scowled at the door as it\nclosed, wondering what he’d gotten himself into.\n“He’s trusting you,” Tenik said quietly, “because he knows having a\nhigh-ranking foreignor in his Household will annoy the pit out of Ka-\nSedial.”\nMichel swallowed. He liked Yaret, but something about his relationship\nwith Sedial was personal. He knew enough about Households to realize that\nif Sedial decided to destroy Yaret, Michel would go down with him. It was\nnot a pleasant thought—and more reason to find Taniel’s informant and\nextract her as quickly as possible.\n“Where do you want to start?” Tenik asked him.\nMichel thought for a moment. “I’m going to give you a list of Blackhat\nsafe houses. I want them all watched—and I want Marhoush followed. In\nthe meantime, I need to get closer to Forgula.”\n“How?”\n“I’m not sure. Do the Dynize have social entertainment?”\nTenik raised an eyebrow.\n“Something like boxing or horse races—a place where Households can\nintermix?”\n“We have … well, the best translation is war games. Very popular\namong all castes.”\n“And Forgula?”\n“She supports one of the players.”\n“Can you take me to one of these games? I don’t need to meet her—I\njust want to observe her.”\n“Is tomorrow soon enough?”\nMichel took a deep breath. He didn’t need to just climb the ranks of\nYaret’s Household. He needed to enter Dynize society. Anything that let\nhim mix with more people would give him a better shot at finding Taniel’s\ninformant. “I’m looking forward to it.”\nCHAPTER 24\nV\nlora met Taniel in the hotel great room for breakfast.

He pushed one over to Vlora without looking up from his sketch.\nShe dropped down across from him and craned her neck. Taniel was\ndrawing the hotel manager.\n“Do you remember that discussion we had last night about being\ncircumspect in our mission here?” he asked quietly.\nVlora dug into the eggs and hash. “Do you remember when I told you\nnot to be a smug prick?” she replied between bites.\nTaniel sucked on his teeth and finally looked up. His face was serious,\nbrows knit in worry.\n“Sorry,” Vlora muttered into her meal.\n“Everyone’s been talking about your fight with Jezzy’s men,” Taniel\nsaid. “In here, out there. It’s the latest fun bit of gossip. Our only saving\ngrace is apparently there are so many fights every day that people will have\nforgotten about yours by tonight.”\n“They tried to recruit me for their club brawl,” Vlora said defensively.\n“And they weren’t being nice about it. What would you have me do? I\ndidn’t take it far enough to give away who I am.”\n“But you did draw attention.” Taniel nodded across the room to an older\nwoman leaning against the hotel bar. She had an easy manner, with a quality\npistol and sword at her belt and epaulets on a faux uniform jacket. She was\nstaring at Vlora and Taniel. “That,” Taniel said, “is the Yellow Creek sheriff.\nThe good news is that she’s apparently the only impartial bit of law in this\ntown—and she’s given you a pass because Jezzy’s boys have a habit of\ncoming on too strong. The bad news is she’s now going to watch us\nclosely.”\n“Until something else draws her attention.” Vlora sniffed the tin mug in\nfront of Taniel and found watered wine. She lifted it to the sheriff and\ndowned the rest.\n“Hopefully soon,” Taniel said.\nVlora fetched beer for the two of them, not trusting the water in a place\nlike this, and returned to her seat. “You’re in a mood today,” she said.\n“I spent half the night wandering the town,” Taniel said. “I don’t sleep\nmuch these days.”\n“Can’t?”\n“Don’t need it.”\nVlora felt the hair on the back of her neck stand on end, and was\nreminded that as much as she wanted to think Taniel was still the boy she’d\nbefriended two decades ago, he was now something more than human.\n“And?”\n“And I can’t find the damned thing.” Taniel flipped his sketchbook\nclosed in frustration, as if he’d expected to waltz into town and discover the\ngodstone within hours. “I can sense it, and that should be enough. Once\nPole knew what we were looking for, she tuned me into the same sorcery as\nthe godstone in Landfall. I should be like a bloodhound to this thing, but\ninstead I’m just walking in circles.”\nVlora sipped her beer. He did expect to find it immediately. “Why do\nyou think that is?”"

        "text": "instead I’m just walking in circles.”\nVlora sipped her beer. He did expect to find it immediately. “Why do\nyou think that is?”\n“No idea. It’s like trying to follow sound in a fog.” He got up and\nstashed his sketchbook, his eyes focused inward on thoughts he did not\nshare. “I’m going to head back out and—”\nTaniel was interrupted by the sound of a crash, and the front door of the\nhotel suddenly burst open. Vlora turned to look for the commotion and her\nheart fell. It was that asshole Dorner from the night before and the friend\nwhom she’d dragged down the stairs. Dorner stumbled around the room,\nclearly drunk, trying to speak with his half tongue. His companion steadied\nhim and pointed at Vlora.\nThe sheriff perked up. “Boys,” she said warningly.\nThey ignored her and came straight toward Vlora. Vlora stood up and\nlay one hand on the pistol in her belt. Neither man had a weapon in hand,\nbut both had swords on them.\nTaniel stepped between Vlora and the two, barring them both with his\narm. “Can I help you fellas?” he asked.\nDorner stabbed a drunken finger toward Vlora, mumbling something.\nHis companion translated. “My brother here lost his tongue to this bitch.\nWe’re gonna take hers and see if it fits.”\n“Everyone needs to calm down!” the sheriff said loudly. She was still\nignored.\n“I think that’s unnecessary,” Taniel said. “Let me buy the two of you a\nfew rounds and we’ll talk about some way less violent to solve this whole\nthing. I think that—”\nDorner shoved Taniel hard in the chest, and both men went for their\nswords. Taniel crashed into Vlora’s table, and before either she or the sheriff\ncould respond, his sword was in his hand.\n“Calm down before someone gets—” Taniel began.\nDorner leapt forward, sword flashing, his companion on his heels. Taniel\nthrust once, pivoted, and pushed before either man could take two steps.\nThe movement was so quick that Vlora could barely follow it. The two men\ntwitched and tumbled, stuck together by Taniel’s sword like chickens on a\nskewer, dead before they hit the floor.\nThe room was deathly silent, all eyes on Taniel. “So much for keeping\nthings quiet,” Vlora muttered under her breath.\nThe sheriff approached, pistol in hand, circling the two bodies and\nleaning over to put her fingers to their necks one at a time. “Dead,” she\nproclaimed.\nSlowly, Taniel pulled his sword out of the two and faced the sheriff.\nVlora could see the fight in his stance, the tension in his legs like a snake\ncoiled to strike. She had no doubt that he could wipe out the whole room\nbefore anyone made it to the door, and the thought frightened her.\n“Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to disarm yourself,” the sheriff said.\n“It was self-defense, ma’am,” Taniel said.\n“I saw that,” she replied, “but we’re gonna have to put it in front of a\njudge. You need to disarm and come with me.” The sheriff’s voice wavered."

You need to disarm and come with me.” The sheriff’s voice wavered.\nShe could see that same tension in his legs that Vlora could, and she was\nscared.\nVlora waited for him to move. Whatever he did, she would have no\nchoice but to back him up. Things had panned out about as badly as was\npossible and she couldn’t think of a way to turn it around.\n“Tan,” she said quietly.\n“I know.” Taniel took a deep breath and bent to wipe his sword on\nDorner’s body before handing it and his pistol to Vlora. “Get my rifle and\npack out of my room,” he said to her. He showed his empty hands and belt\nto the sheriff and looked down at the bodies, dismayed. “I guess I am a\nsmug prick. And you’re on your own until we can get this sorted out.”\nThe sheriff slowly put up her pistol. “You two are just a load of trouble,\naren’t you?”\n“Just trying to live our lives, ma’am,” Vlora said.\n“We’ll get this sorted out before a judge,” the sheriff repeated, “and then\nI’ll ask you kindly to live those lives somewhere else. Understand?”\nVlora swore to herself, meeting Taniel’s gaze. This was going to be a\nproblem, and both of them knew it. “How long will this take?” Taniel\nasked.\n“Couple weeks.” The sheriff sniffed. “We’ve got just one judge and a\ndamned lot of violence.”\nVlora could see in Taniel’s eyes that he was reconsidering his offer to go\nquietly. But the options were slim: Either he could sit in a cell for two\nweeks while Vlora searched on her own, or they could cut their way out\nthrough a lot of innocent people and end up being run out of town. She\nlooked meaningfully at the sheriff and nodded.\n“So be it,” Taniel said coldly.\nThe sheriff escorted Taniel out of the building, leaving Vlora alone with\ntwo corpses and a whole bunch of eyes staring at her. She left the rest of her\nwine and took Taniel’s weapons upstairs, then fetched his pack and stowed\nit in her own room.\nShe slipped out the back of the building, hoping to avoid any more\nunwanted attention. Halfway down the street she stopped and swore to\nherself, realizing that without that damned magical compass in Taniel’s\nhead, she didn’t have a chance of finding anything. She muttered and swore\nto herself and continued on, trying to formulate a plan.\nShe found a secluded street in the Gurlish quarter and sat down in an\nalley to try and focus. She closed her eyes, and took a deep sniff of powder\nto enhance her senses and focus her mind. Once she was in a deep trance,\nshe opened her third eye.\nThe world became a hazy, colorless place. Buildings and people seemed\nalmost translucent, and she swept her gaze all around her looking for color.\nThere was a little of it—small flames, like candles burning in windows, that\nshe knew belonged to Knacked throughout the city.

There were a few dozen\nof them, which was unsurprising considering the amount of money involved\nin such a town. Knacked, after all, were useful people.\nThere was nothing else, though. No bright flames of a Privileged, and\nnone of the customary pastel smudges that indicated leftover sorcery. She\ntried to remember what the godstone in Landfall looked like in the Else, and\nrealized that she’d never bothered to check. In the chaos of the battle and\nsubsequent retreat, it had never even crossed her mind.\nShe cursed herself for her foolishness, and closed her third eye.\n“I can’t do this on my own,” she said quietly to herself.\nShe returned to the main street and walked along, eyes on the signs\nabove the storefronts. It wasn’t long until she found one that said EXPRESS\nMESSENGERS: YOUR LETTERS, CONFIDENTIAL AND GUARANTEED.\nIt was a company that she’d seen in Landfall, and she had made use of\ntheir services before. She went inside, where a single clerk waited behind a\ndusty desk, half-asleep with his chin resting on his fist. He roused himself\nas Vlora entered.\n“Paper,” Vlora demanded.\nShe sat in the corner and penned a letter in Adran military code. She\nsprinkled the wet ink with black powder and then sealed it in wax with a\nsignet ring she kept in her pocket. It was marked with the old symbol of the\nRiflejacks—a chevron over a powder horn. She gave the letter to the clerk.\n“Where to?” he asked.\n“That,” Vlora said, placing several coins on his desk, “might be\ndifficult.”\nShe gave the clerk her hotel and room number in case of an answer and\nstepped out into the midmorning air, breathing in the stench. She wanted\nnothing more than to crawl into a bottle until Olem arrived with the army,\nbut that didn’t seem like a very good use of her time. She needed a plan—\nany plan—that would keep her moving and looking.\nWithout Taniel’s sorcerous compass, she was going to have to depend on\nfootwork. Luckily, she’d already done some thinking on the matter. She\nwould walk each valley and examine each mine, combing the landscape\nunder the pretense of looking for an employer who wasn’t the two big-boss\nfools here in town. It would be slow going, and there was a very real risk of\nattracting attention, but it was the best plan she had.\nShe would look for anything suspicious in this world and in the Else.\n“Ma’am?”\nVlora was pulled out of her thoughts by a voice at her elbow. She turned\nand immediately stiffened, her hand falling to her sword arm. There was a\nPalo woman by her side, wearing a duster and tricorn, and the tight pants\nand loose shirt of a duelist. She was accompanied by seven men and\nwomen, most of them Palo, all wearing similar outfits and also armed with\nsmall swords.\nVlora ordered them in her mind, body prepared to work through the\nmotions as she cut her way free of imminent violence.

The process took her\nmere seconds, but it was interrupted by a friendly clearing of the woman’s\nthroat.\nShe looked at Vlora’s sword hand. “No need for that, ma’am,” she said.\n“We’re here to talk.”\n“About what?”\n“Our boss wants to meet you.”\n“And who is your boss?” She thought she had a pretty good idea.\n“His name is Burt.”\nBrown Bear Burt. Jezzy’s competition. Vlora considered her options.\nEight against one were steep odds in a fair fight. She still had a buzz from\nher earlier sniff of powder, so she could probably take them without too\nmuch risk. But if even one was a skilled swordsman, she could be in\ntrouble.\nHer eyes narrowed as she realized that not one of them was carrying an\nounce of powder. Odd, that. A coincidence? Or something else?\nShe thought of Taniel sitting in a cell in the Yellow Creek sheriff’s\noffice, and decided that the mission had already taken a big enough hit.\n“When?” she asked.\n“Right now, if that’s convenient.”\nVlora took her hand off her sword. “Then let’s get this over with.”\nThe Yellow Creek Picks, as they called themselves, were headquartered at a\nbrothel not more than a few blocks from Vlora’s own hotel. It was on the\nedge of the Gurlish quarter, a sprawling, three-story wooden building with\nan enormous barroom and numerous hallways leading into the bowels of\nthe establishment. Men and women of every nationality in various states of\nundress circled the room, chatting up the few miners who hadn’t yet left to\ntend to their claims.\nWhores of both sexes eyed Vlora as she walked in, but she was spared\nthe sales pitches and escorted straight upstairs to a spacious room that\nlooked down onto the main floor of the brothel. The center of the room was\ntaken up by a wide desk on top of the biggest bearskin Vlora had ever seen.\nThe man behind it, despite his name, looked nothing like a bear. Burt\nwas only an inch or so taller than Vlora. He had flaming-red hair and\nmuttonchops and a wiry build. He wore the kind of expensive suit Vlora\nonly saw in the best parts of Landfall, with a gold chain hanging from the\nbreast pocket and a pair of spectacles perched on the tip of his nose. He had\npapers in one hand, reading them while toying with a big boz knife, the tip\nof which was buried in his gouged desk.\nHe set the paper down and looked up as Vlora came up the stairs. She\nwaited for her escorts to take her weapons and frisk her, but instead the Palo\nguards retreated back down to the bar.\nBurt leaned forward, grinning at her, and opened a box on his desk.\n“Cigar?”\n“I would, thanks.” Vlora took one, figuring that she might as well enjoy\na few minutes before the bastard tried to have her killed, and allowed him to\nlight the end.\n“Your name is …”\n“Verundish,” Vlora said, using the name of an old military colleague."

A lot of Palo spoke Adran, but he sounded like\nhe’d been born there.\nVlora puffed on the cigar. The tobacco was good—very good. She held\nit out, looking along the length for a tobacconist’s mark. It was a small\nspear with a circle around it. Nothing she recognized. She waved away a\nface full of smoke. “That’s a good cigar.”\n“Little place off the coast I invested in a while back. Things go well,\nthey’ll be selling them as far away as Strenland in a couple years.”\nVlora took another puff, then set the cigar carefully on the ashtray on\nBurt’s desk. She couldn’t let herself relax, not here. She’d already been\nintroduced to the way people do business here by Jezzy’s Shovels, and even\nsomeone as skilled as she could wind up facedown in a ditch if she wasn’t\ncareful. “Is there something I can help you with, Burt?”\n“Hmm. Verundish, you said?”\n“That’s right.”\nBurt got to his feet, still puffing on his cigar, and walked over to the\nbalcony to look down to the bar below. He returned to his desk, pouring a\nglass of whiskey and offering it to her. She declined, and Burt shrugged and\ntook a sip. “Why are you here, Verundish?”\n“Came looking for work.”\n“That’s what you say. Yet you’ve already turned down my competitor,\nJezzy.”\n“I’m not looking for that kind of work,” Vlora said. “This town is going\nto explode one of these days—anyone can feel it—and I have no interest in\nbeing in the middle. I’d like something a little quieter.”\nBurt took a seat, throwing his feet up on his desk. “Your companion,\ntoo? He’s looking for something quiet?”\n“That’s the plan.”\nBurt shifted in his seat. “See, now, that’s what’s so strange to me. Your\nkind doesn’t really attract quiet, do they? You’re too valuable for quiet\nwork.”\n“My kind?” Vlora was genuinely puzzled. Did he mean Adrans?\n“Powder mages.”\nVlora stiffened, forcing herself not to reach for her pistol and blow\nBurt’s head off right here and now. She, Vlora Flint, was a celebrity and a\nrenowned general. But there were still a lot of people in the world who had\nit out for powder mages without a name. “I’m not sure what you’re talking\nabout.”\nBurt rolled his eyes. “Don’t play coy, Verundish.

        "text": "about.”\nBurt rolled his eyes. “Don’t play coy, Verundish. I’ve got a Knacked on\nmy payroll that can sense powder mages. Not a very useful Knack, but he’s\na smart man, so I keep him around. He earned his pay when you walked\ninto town.”\nVlora’s fingers crept toward her pistol. Behind the desk, with his line of\nsight, he wouldn’t be able to tell.\nBurt continued before she could respond. “Don’t get me wrong. I’m not\nthreatening you or your companion. I’m not an idiot. Nor do I actually want\nto know what two powder mages are doing out here on the frontier looking\nfor quiet work. If you’re keeping your heads down, I’m not the type of fool\nto bring that to anyone’s attention.”\n“So what do you want?” Vlora asked coldly.\n“Same as Jezzy wants. I just happen to know what you’re worth.” Burt\ntook his feet down and leaned forward. “Come work for me—the two of\nyou—and I’ll pay you five thousand krana up front and fifty thousand the\nfirst day of next spring. Each.”\nVlora couldn’t help but raise her eyebrows. He actually did know what a\npowder mage was worth, though he wasn’t sure who Vlora really was. That\nwas an immense amount of money for a hired gun for six months of work.\nShe wasn’t interested, of course, but at least she didn’t have to kill him. Yet.\nShe shook her head.\nBurt frowned. “Eighty thousand.”\n“Pardon?”\n“Same offer. Eighty thousand krana.”\nVlora swore inwardly. If she was really a hired gun, she would jump on\nthe offer in an instant. “It’s not about the money, I’m afraid.”\n“What’s it about?”\nShe tried to come up with a better excuse, but found herself grasping at\nstraws. Nobody turned down that kind of money. “I don’t want to get\ninvolved,” she said emphatically. “I want quiet work. Easy work. I’m not\nhere to show off.”\n“Ah.” Burt puffed on his cigar, examining her through half-closed eyes.\n“You’re hiding from something.” He raised his hands in a peaceful gesture.\n“Again, I’m making no threats. Just an observation.”\nVlora knew the risk of such an excuse. If Burt wanted, he could try to\nblackmail her. But if he was as smart as he seemed, threatening a powder\nmage was probably low on his to-do list. “It’s not personal. If it makes you\nfeel any better, your competitor isn’t going to get a rise out of either me or\nmy companion, no matter how much she offers to pay. There are things\nworth more than money.”\n“We agree on that, at least. A little quiet is priceless,” Burt said\nthoughtfully. He stood up again, clearly frustrated, and paced behind his\ndesk. “If you’re not getting involved, you should probably get out of town.”\n“I’m not going anywhere until a judge clears my companion.”\n“I’d suggest you reconsider,” Burt said.\n“Is that a threat?” Vlora asked, keeping her tone neutral.\n“Not at all.

You’re right when you say this town\nis hot. Fighting will break out eventually, and when it does, anyone with a\nweapon will be a target. What’s more, Jezzy doesn’t take no for an answer.\nYou’re going to be a liability for her and, frankly, for me. I’ve got your\nassurances that you won’t get involved, but I don’t know you. You could be\nlying. Or things could just change.”\n“That sounds like a threat.”\nBurt showed her his empty hands. “Cross my heart. Just friendly\nadvice.”\n“I don’t know you, either.”\n“Touché.” Burt chuckled. “I think we each know where the other stands\nnow, so I’m not going to waste any more of your time. One last offer: Come\nwork for me.” Vlora tensed, looking over her shoulder. The sentence was\ntoo ominous not to be the precursor to some sort of retaliation if she said\nno. But the two of them were alone. Burt continued. “How about this: You\nsleep on it tonight. Talk to your friend at the town jail, and chew on this bit\nof information: Jezzy already has herself a powder mage. I’ll pay you two\nwhatever you want to kill the bastard.”\nVlora rocked back. So that’s why Burt was so anxious to hire her and\nTaniel. Two powder mages to counter one. It was surprising information,\nand more helpful than Burt knew. A powder mage could sense another, so if\nJezzy didn’t know what she and Taniel were yet, she would soon. And that\ncomplicated the pit out of their mission.\nThings just kept getting worse and worse.\nVlora stood up, straightening her jacket. “I’ll take that under\nadvisement. Thank you for being … polite.”\n“Of course,” Burt said, raising his cigar. “But lest you think I’m too\npolite: I have people I trust who know what you are. If a bullet happens to\nfind my brain, they’ll make sure that whatever you’re running from is able\nto find you. Understand?”\nVlora smiled at him tightly. This man was not an idiot. Unfortunately.\n“Good afternoon,” she told him.\nCHAPTER 25\nM\nichel followed Tenik into the capitol building at about noon. It was a\nweekend and the halls were mostly empty, with just a few couriers and\nsoldiers present. Other than when he handed himself over to Yaret at the\nbeginning of this mess, it was the first time Michel had been back in the\nbuilding since the occupation, and he allowed himself to take in the small\ndetails that had changed along with the government: Red-on-black Dynize\nflags flew from banisters and high windows, while much of the upholstery\non hallway benches had been changed to match. Everything that had the old\nregime symbols and colors had been either replaced or defaced.\nAs a spy, Michel was used to being an outsider in enemy territory, but it\nstill felt very strange not to see the familiar sunflower yellow of the\nFatrastan flags or the rose symbol of the Blackhats.

He knew that they were\njust cosmetic changes, but they troubled him more than he’d expected.\nHe did not allow his unease to show on his face as he followed Tenik\ndown the long main hall. “Who will I meet at this war game?” he asked.\nTenik flipped his coin without breaking stride, catching it every time.\n“It’s hard to say. Most of us haven’t been able to attend a game since we left\nhome. This one was put together by the Tchellasi Household—Tchellasi is\nthe minister of finance.”\n“I’m guessing since we’re in the capitol building that it’s not exactly\nopen to the public.”\n“You guess right. It’ll be mostly government bureaucrats, senior\nHousehold members who make some excuse to get away from their duties\nfor a few hours. I’ll stake my ration card on Forgula attending—one of the\nplayers is her cousin.”\nThey stopped once as a Privileged and his retinue passed by. Michel\nmimicked Tenik’s bowed head before they continued their trip down the\nhall. “Will there be any of those?” Michel asked, glancing over his shoulder.\n“Privileged? I doubt it. I’ll be surprised if we even see any of the minor\nNames. It’ll be mostly cupbearers, Captains of the Guard, stewards, and\ndoormen.”\n“The people who really run the empire, you mean?” This could be a\nvery good experience for Michel. He needed to keep his eyes and ears open\n—but not lose focus on the current issue with Forgula.\nTenik gave him a sly smile. “We would never presume.”\n“I’m sure you wouldn’t. What role do the Privileged play in Households,\nby the way?”\n“They don’t belong to Households,” Tenik said. “Technically, all\nPrivileged are property of the emperor.”\n“I saw a Privileged with Ka-Sedial yesterday.”\nTenik wrinkled his nose. “Sedial is different. He speaks with the\nemperor’s voice on this expedition, so the Privileged report to him. I didn’t\nsee this Privileged, but I’m surprised Sedial openly has one as an escort.\nEmperor’s voice or not, he has so far been careful not to flaunt his power on\nthis expedition lest he encourage several of the lesser Households to ally\nagainst him.” Tenik shook his head. “I’ll look into the matter.”\nThey rounded a corner and continued on for another hundred paces,\nwhere they reached a double set of ornate doors. Tenik pushed one open\nwithout knocking, revealing a room that belied the quiet of the rest of the\nbuilding.\nWhat had once been the foreign dignitary room had been, at first glance,\nconverted into a boxing arena. It was already well suited to observation,\nwith high banks of windows and tiered seating where bureaucrats could\nobserve important meetings. More chairs and another set of tiered seating\nhad been added all around the room, and the enormous table where Lindet\nhad met with Ka-Sedial had been removed.\nThe arena-like feel was what reminded Michel of boxing.

The room was\nfilled with people, stinking from so many bodies, filled with the noise of\ntheir cheers, jeers, and the placing of wagers. Tenik shouldered his way\nthrough the crowd, pulling Michel along behind him until they reached the\nobject of everyone’s attention.\nIn the center of the room, where the enormous meeting table had once\nstood, was an octagon over twenty feet across and filled with smaller\noctagonal tiles of various colors. Carved ivory and jade figurines stood on\nsome of those tiles. It was, to Michel’s eyes, the likeness of a general’s war\nmap, and it didn’t take him long to realize that the two people standing\nbeside the octagon were the “generals” in this war game.\nThe players moved around the map freely, using long sticks to carefully\nadjust the positions of the figurines in a seemingly preordained order. A\nthird person, like the referee in a boxing match, occasionally would reach\nout with a long pincer stick to remove one of the pieces.\nMichel was immediately taken with the game. Tenik had explained the\nbasics the night before, and he’d thought the concept sounded slow and\nboring. But this moved quickly, each player taking their turn in a matter of\nseconds while the crowd’s noise grew from silence, to whispers, to a roar—\nall depending on the actions of the players.\nHe tore his eyes away from the game as Tenik tugged on his sleeve.\nThey moved back through the crowd to the edge of the room, climbing up\ninto an open spot on the tiered seating where they could get a decent look at\nthe room.\nMichel took one look around and immediately realized how out of place\nhe looked. His blond-dyed hair and his part-Kressian, part-Palo features\nmade him stand out in a room full of redheads. Even his suit—brown cotton\ntrousers and jacket—seemed drab and strange among all the teal and ivory\nworn by the Dynize.\nMore than a few were watching him as he did a slower examination of\nthe room. Some whispered to each other curiously, while others were\nobviously annoyed at his presence.\n“Tell me,” Michel said out of the corner of his mouth, “do foreigners\noften attend these games?”\n“Not that I can recall.”\nMichel cursed himself for not thinking about how out of place he would\nbe—and Tenik for not warning him. He needed to stay in the shadows while\nhe looked for Taniel’s informant, not damn well stand on a stage.\nHe forced himself to ignore the glares and the whispers. “Names,” he\ntold Tenik. “I need to know who these people are.”\n“There’s a lot of people here.”\n“I’m going to have to learn them eventually.”\n“Where do you want me to start?” Tenik asked.\nMichel’s wandering gaze finally found his target. Forgula stood about\ntwenty yards away, down at the other end of the tiered seating with her neck\ncraned to see over the heads of people in front of her. To his surprise, he\nrecognized the woman just behind her.\n“I thought you said there wouldn’t be a Privileged here,” Michel said.\n“Eh?” Tenik looked around. “Where do you see a Privileged?”"

That’s the woman I mentioned earlier.”\nTenik searched for a moment. “Ah. Saen-Ichtracia. I should have\nknown.”\n“About what?”\n“A Privileged with Sedial? She’s his granddaughter.”\nMichel made a mental note that this was not someone he wanted to cross\npaths with. “She’s pretty.”\nTenik laughed softly. “They call her ‘the people eater.’”\n“Do I want to know why?”\n“She’s survived seventeen separate assassination attempts. The first was\nwhen she was seven. She strangled the assassin with the string from one of\nher nursery toys.”\nMichel let out a soft whistle. “Because of her grandfather?”\n“She’s a member of the imperial family and a Privileged. She gained\nenemies simply by being born.” Tenik clicked his tongue thoughtfully. “Her\nnickname, it also has a double meaning. You know about Privileged, right?”\n“They’re damned dangerous.”\n“Not that. The sorcery, it makes them ravenous.”\n“For sex?” Michel scoffed. “I thought that was a myth.”\n“No myth,” Tenik said. “As far as I’ve been able to tell, our Privileged\nare less … discerning than yours. Try not to catch her eye. If you do, she\nwill use you like a damp rag and discard you. Whether you survive the\nencounter will be left up to chance.” Michel turned to look at Tenik,\nexpecting a tongue-in-cheek smile, but the cupbearer was dead serious.\n“You’re joking.”\n“A friendly warning,” Tenik said. He went on. “The man beside her is a\ncupbearer for the Jerotl Household—minister of public works. The woman\nbehind her is a captain of the Sedial Household guard.”\nTenik spent the next ten minutes pointing out people and telling Michel\ntheir names, Households, and their occupations. Michel repeated each name\nthat was told to him, trying to get the pronunciations down and casting them\nto memory. Within minutes he was trying to juggle two dozen names. Soon\nthat number doubled. The game below them carried on, and the noise in the\nroom began to grow in pitch, suggesting to Michel that some sort of\nconclusion was forthcoming.\nMichel’s eyes kept returning to Forgula. Tenik had described her as a\ncapable woman, and as Michel examined her, he began to see through the\ndeception of his first impression that she had a gentle face. While it was\ntrue that some baby fat still clung to her cheeks, she had the thin, hard body\nof an athlete and her eyes were just as intense as those of the Privileged\nstanding behind her. She grimaced at the game, occasionally smiled, and\nonce bore her teeth toward the players with an open malice.\nThere was a weight to her right sleeve, suggesting to Michel that she\ncarried a blackjack—the same weapon she’d beaten him with last week. His\nforehead and arm were finally beginning to heal, and he reminded himself\nnot to allow this to get personal. He was here, he told himself, just until he\ncould find Taniel’s informant.

He was here, he told himself, just until he\ncould find Taniel’s informant. The opportunity to have some vengeance on\nForgula by disrupting whatever she was doing with Marhoush was a\nsecondary concern.\nUnfortunately, the informant’s name, Mara, was not among those that\nTenik shared with him by the time the roar of the spectators suddenly\ndrowned out the next name that Tenik whispered into Michel’s ear. Roughly\nhalf of the room broke out into a cheer, while others looked away with\ndisgust and disappointment.\nMichel felt his own disappointment, swearing under his breath. He tried\nto remember what little Taniel had told him about Mara, that she was part of\na Dynize higher-up’s retinue. “Retinue,” he decided, meant “Household.”\nBut now that he knew roughly how big a Household could be, that\ninformation was practically useless.\nThere had to be a more efficient way to do this.\nMichel discarded the thought and turned to Forgula, whom he saw\nshaking hands with the crowd.\n“Her cousin won,” Michel said.\nTenik nodded. “He’s a very good player, but he got lucky.”\n“You were watching the game?”\n“Weren’t you?”\n“I was listening to you.”\nTenik slapped him on the shoulder. “If you come to more games, you’ll\nhave to learn to talk and watch. Good morning!” he called to someone a few\nrows down the seating, waving a greeting. He whispered the person’s name\nin Michel’s ear, which Michel promptly forgot.\nMichel’s attention was still on Forgula as she began to move through the\ncrowd, exchanging a few words here, touching an arm there, then a longer\nconversation. She snubbed one woman, warmly greeted another, then put\nher arm around a man who spoke in her ear.\nMichel noted the faces of each of the people she spoke with, and how\nthey interacted. “This room smells like politics,” he said to Tenik. “These\ngames are the political underbelly of Dynize, aren’t they?”\nA moment of silence passed, and Michel turned to find Tenik watching\nhim carefully. “You’re very perceptive.”\n“It’s my job,” Michel answered. “I have to know just enough about\neverything to keep from getting killed. And instinct tells me to get out of\nhere as quickly as possible.”\n“Instinct?”\n“Instinct, and the looks your compatriots are giving me. I’m unwelcome\nhere.”\n“That is true.”\nMichel wondered again if coming here had been a mistake. He was a\nspy, and he should be operating from the shadows. Let the Dynize upper\ncrust wonder about the foreign spy in Yaret’s Household, but keep himself\nhidden.\nBut not all spying, he reminded himself, was from the shadows. Hiding\nin plain sight was a useful strategy. If it didn’t get you killed.\nSomeone passed him on their way down the tiered seating, knocking\nhard into his shoulder and almost throwing him to the ground. A word was\nhissed as Tenik caught him. Michel regained his balance. “What did that\nmean?” Michel asked.\n“He called you a dirty foreigner.” Tenik’s eyes narrowed at the\nassailant’s back."

Michel regained his balance. “What did that\nmean?” Michel asked.\n“He called you a dirty foreigner.” Tenik’s eyes narrowed at the\nassailant’s back.\n“Is he an enemy of the Household?” Michel asked.\n“An ally, unfortunately. He’s a footman for the minister of agriculture. I\nwill speak to him later.”\n“Let it go,” Michel suggested.\nTenik shook his head firmly. “You’re a member of Yaret’s Household\nnow, whether our allies like it or not. And someone like him”—he nodded\nto the assailant—“is not high enough a station to get away with insulting\nyou. His minister isn’t even here. She’s back in Dynize, schmoozing the\nemperor instead of helping with the cause.”\n“Just out of curiosity, who is high enough station to get away with\ninsulting me?” Michel asked, eyeing Forgula as she continued to wind her\nway through the crowd. He studied everyone she made contact with—who\nknew about her contact with the Blackhats? Was there a conspiracy? Was\nshe a traitor? Was her master vying for more power?\nTenik considered the question for a moment before answering. “That is a\ncomplicated answer. If you are insulted, you should let it go. I can deal with\nit.”\n“That sounds like my mother telling me to ignore the boys who beat me\nup in school,” Michel responded. He caught the eye of another Dynize\nstaring in his direction, and realized with a start that it was Ichtracia. The\nPrivileged was watching him with open curiosity, and Michel felt a shiver\nrun down his spine. “I think I’ve learned enough for one day,” he said to\nTenik. “We should go.”\nHe began to head down the tiered seating, only to see Forgula directly\nbelow him, speaking urgently with a young woman in a soldier’s uniform.\nMichel turned to work his way around her just as she looked up toward him.\nHe swore silently, resisting the urge to slink away, and decided to walk\ndirectly past her on his way out. He decided Forgula was someone to whom\nhe shouldn’t show weakness.\nMichel looked her in the eye and gave her his most charming smile.\nA look of disgust crossed her face. “Tenik,” she said sharply.\nTenik was just one step above and behind Michel. “Good morning,\nDevin-Forgula,” he said, touching his forehead in greeting.\n“Don’t ‘good morning’ me, Tenik. I’ve just received news of another\nexplosion. At least thirteen soldiers dead or wounded down in Lower\nLandfall.”\nTenik stepped down beside Michel and scowled. “I’m sure that Yaret has\nbeen informed.”\n“Has he?” Forgula took a half step toward Tenik. “Because his\ncupbearer is attending a game with a foreigner instead of out there looking\nfor the men killing our troops.”\nMichel bit his tongue. She had no idea she’d been followed the other\nday, and he had to resist the urge to throw her meeting with Marhoush back\nin her face. He could see the same struggle on Tenik’s face. “You’ve no\nright to question Tenik’s actions,” Michel said.\n“Why is he talking to me?” Forgula asked Tenik."

You were good enough to attack an unarmed man,\nbut too good to talk to him?” His jaw snapped shut at the end of the\nsentence and he immediately regretted opening his mouth. But, as his\nmother liked to say, in for a penny, in for a krana.\nForgula’s nostrils flared. “Silence your new pet, Tenik.”\n“Silence yourself,” Tenik said. Michel, it seemed, wasn’t the only one\nsick of Forgula’s shit. Tenik crossed his arms, staring her down. “He’s right.\nYou’ve no place questioning what I do and how I do it. My Household is\ncombing the city for the empire’s enemies while Sedial ignores our pleas\nfor more soldiers. This foreigner has handed us more enemy agents in the\nlast few days than anyone in your Household.”\n“You have no idea the sacrifices my Household makes to hold this city,”\nForgula hissed. She turned her nose up. “I won’t speak another word in the\nforeigner’s presence.”\nMichel noted that the room had grown silent. Well over a hundred sets\nof eyes were watching the confrontation. Whispers had already begun, and\nhe thought he saw money change hands somewhere in the crowd. The\nDynize, it seemed, enjoyed a good show as much as any Kressian.\n“You’re a damned coward,” Michel told her.\nForgula’s eyes widened slightly. In Fatrasta, “coward” was a trigger\nword to start a fight. She glared at him, but did not move. “Slime,” she\nretorted.\nMichel sought his memory for the worst Palo insults his mother had\ntaught him as a boy. “Horse eater,” he threw back at her.\nThere was a sharp intake of breath from the watching Dynize. Someone\nbehind Michel swore, while a woman in the crowd laughed out loud.\nForgula’s arm jerked stiffly, and the moment Michel had been waiting for\narrived—her blackjack came to hand and she swung her arm.\nMichel barely got his own arm up in time to keep the blow from hitting\nhim below the eye. His forearm went numb, and he couldn’t help but gasp\nat the pain that shot down his arm. He stumbled into her, his numb hand\ngrasping without feeling at her jacket. With the other hand, he dipped into\nhis pocket and slipped his fingers into his knuckle-dusters. She shoved him\nbackward, then raised her blackjack one more time.\nMichel’s jab with his knuckle-dusters was hurried and sloppy, but he\nstill managed to catch her a glancing blow on the chin that sent her wide-\neyed and reeling into the arms of her companions.\nSomeone to Michel’s right kicked him hard in the side of the knee.

He was shoved into a chair and left while Tenik ran back inside.\nTenik returned a moment later. “What the pit did you think you were\ndoing provoking her like that?” he hissed.\nIt was the first time Michel had seen Tenik genuinely angry. They were\nalone in this corridor, and Michel let himself lean back and test his numb\narm, wincing in pain. “Ow,” he responded.\n“You’re lucky she didn’t stave your head in,” Tenik said. “You’re lucky\nyou—” Tenik stopped, looked closely at Michel, then gasped. “You did that\non purpose.”\nMichel forced himself to chuckle. He didn’t feel it, not with the pain\nshooting up his left arm.\n“Why?” Tenik demanded.\n“I wanted to see how easily she was provoked,” Michel answered.\n“I could have told you that!”\n“I also wanted to make it very clear to her that I hit back.” Michel\nworked the knuckle-dusters off his fingers and waved them at Tenik before\nputting them back in his pocket. He reached into the opposite pocket with\nthe numb fingers of the other hand and showed Tenik a thick leather\nbooklet. “And I wanted the chance to steal her pocketbook.”\n“Like pit …” Tenik stared at him for several moments. “How did you\nknow she carried one?”\n“I saw her write in it earlier.”\n“If she realizes that you—”\n“She already wants to kill me,” Michel said. “I can see it in her eyes.\nShe’s not going to admit to anyone that I stole from her, so what’s the\nharm?”\n“Forgula can do a lot of harm,” Tenik warned.\nMichel leaned back on the bench, cradling his damaged arm, hoping the\nfeeling would come back soon. “I haven’t picked a pocket for a couple\nyears. Still have the talent for it, though, even with numb fingers.”\n“You disgust me.” There was a note of respect in Tenik’s voice. Michel\ndecided he only half meant it.\nBefore Michel could retort, the door to the foreign-dignitary room\nopened and Michel swallowed whatever he had to say. Saen-Ichtracia, the\ngranddaughter of Yaret’s political enemy and a damned Privileged sorcerer,\nstepped into the hall and closed the door behind her. She tilted her head to\none side, pulling a wry face, and stared at Michel.\nMichel glanced at Tenik, hoping he’d step in with some excuse, and\nwhen no such help was forthcoming, attempted a furtive glance toward the\nclosest exit.\n“Michel Bravis, was it?” Ichtracia asked. She spoke in perfect Adran,\ncatching Michel off guard.\nMichel’s mouth was dry. “That’s me.”\nIchtracia let out a giggle—a damned giggle—and Michel realized she’d\nbeen the one to laugh when he called Forgula a horse eater. “I haven’t seen\nsomeone hit Forgula since I was a little girl.” She clapped her hands slowly,\nthe grin on her face speaking volumes of both respect and pity. “I think the"

We—”\nIchtracia held up a finger toward Tenik without even looking at him. He\nsnapped his mouth shut. “Michel,” Ichtracia said, “I won’t keep you any\nlonger. I just wanted you to know that you made me laugh. Good\nafternoon.” She turned and swept down the hall without another word,\nleaving Michel with a hammering heart—and a good view of her hips as\nshe walked away.\nShe was well gone when Tenik said in a low voice, “I warned you about\ncatching her attention.”\n“Believe me when I say I had no intention of doing so. Shit, shit, shit.”\nMichel got to his feet, trying to shake the numbness out of his arm and only\nreceiving another jolt of pain for his efforts. Between Hendres and Forgula,\nhis damned arm had taken a beating the last two weeks. He forced himself\nto put Ichtracia out of his mind and held up Forgula’s wallet. “Let’s go\nsomewhere private and see what we can find out about our friend.”\nCHAPTER 26\nV\nlora spent the next several days scouting up and down the numerous\nvalleys that led into the mountains from Yellow Creek. They varied in size,\nfrom immense canyons big enough to march a field army through, to little\ncrags and gullies that were hard to spot unless you were right on top of\nthem. The biggest were filled to the brim with prospectors—larger mines up\nthe side of the canyon belonging to either Jezzy or Burt—and the streams\nfilled with independent panners hoping to make it rich on gold dust.\nVlora created a system in her head, starting with the largest and busiest\ncanyon and then working clockwise around Yellow Creek. It was slow\ngoing, searching everywhere without looking like she was searching\neverywhere, and then doing the whole thing again with her sorcerous\nsenses. So much time spent in the Else exhausted her, leaving her strung out\nat the end of each day with barely enough wits about her to keep an eye out\nfor Jezzy and Burt’s goons, or for the powder mage Burt had warned her\nabout.\nShe talked to a hundred prospectors each day under the guise of looking\nfor a quiet, but well-paying job, and had heard enough gossip from them to\nfill an entire lifetime. Everyone had news of the distant war—that the loss\nof Landfall was enemy propaganda, that Lindet had been captured and\nhanged by the Dynize—and everyone had an opinion on Burt and Jezzy.\nBetween the two, everyone agreed, Jezzy was the more heavy-handed but\nhad more money.

Seventeen prospectors had offered her a job—most of\nthem on behalf of the two big bosses—and no less than twice that many had\noffered graphic descriptions of what their sex life would be like if she\nfollowed them back to their tent.\nShe was irritable and coming up empty-handed, and it did not improve\nher mood when a man of about thirty fell into step beside her as she headed\ntoward her hotel through the Palo district.\nHe was nearly six feet tall, with blond hair and blue eyes; a wide,\npleasant face wrinkled from scars and smile lines; and a broad-shouldered\nbuild that made her think of Rosvelean sailors. He carried a pistol and\nsword, and wore a bicorn and red bandanna with a loose-fitting white shirt,\nsailor’s boots, and a long-tailed dressing coat that had seen better days. He\nlooked like a damned storybook pirate.\nBut what caught Vlora’s attention was not the way he was dressed but\nrather the way he smelled—he reeked of black powder, and she barely had\nto touch her sorcerous senses to know that this man was a powder mage.\nShe kept walking, pretending she hadn’t noticed him, and let her hand\nfall on the pommel of her sword. She pushed away her exhaustion, senses\nprepared, her heart beating quickly. She’d never fought a powder mage\nbefore—not for real. She’d sparred and practiced, and she’d considered all\nthe theories about what a fight between two mages would entail, but never\nbefore engaged in true combat. As she looked up from her thoughts, she\nfound herself shocked that he was walking beside her instead of putting a\nbullet in her head from across town.\n“It’s a lovely evening,” he said, clearing his throat.\nVlora stopped, turning toward him, putting her best card-playing face\nforward. “What do you want?”\nHe offered his hand. “My name is Nohan. Pleased to meet you.”\nHesitantly, expecting a trap, Vlora took his hand. He squeezed a bit too\nhard, with too broad of a smile, and Vlora snatched back her hand and\nwatched him cautiously. “Verundish. What do you want?”\n“Can I buy you a drink?”\nIt was not a question Vlora expected, but her immediate thought was to\nget this man off the street and out of the open. If this came to a fight, she\nwould have to do things that would not easily be explained to onlookers.\n“Sure,” she said, nodding to a bar across the street. “There.”\nThe bar was obviously a Palo establishment, but it was small and nearly\nempty, and the proprietor didn’t question them when they ordered drinks.\n“You’re Adran,” Nohan observed after they’d been served.\nVlora tried to guess his accent. “And you’re Starlish.”\nHe nodded. “Very good. I wouldn’t have expected to see an Adran\npowder mage in this part of the world. You here with those mercenaries\ndown south?” His tone was light, even friendly, and Vlora tried to loosen\nthe knot in between her shoulder blades. Tensing up would not help things\nif this came to a fight.\n“Avoiding them, more like,” she answered."

That General Flint is a real bitch. You don’t want to\ncross her. She’ll try to recruit you, and kill you if she can’t.”\nVlora barely resisted laughing in his face. “Is that so? I’ve never met\nher.”\n“I have,” Nohan said, using the opportunity to lower his voice and move\na little closer. “Her goons chased me halfway across Adro a few years ago\nwhen I told them I wasn’t interested in joining her cabal.”\n“No kidding?” Vlora’s mind raced, trying to remember if any such thing\nhad ever happened. She’d never seen this man before in her life, but the\nname was vaguely familiar. Had one of her underlings gotten into a scrap\nwith him?\n“No kidding,” Nohan confirmed. He put money on the bar, enough for\nboth their drinks, and clinked his against hers. “But I gotta stay\nindependent, if you know what I mean. More money in that.”\nVlora fiddled with her drink, hoping that he wasn’t smart enough to plan\nahead and have her poisoned. She had picked the bar, so she doubted that.\n“So you’re the other mage in town, eh?”\n“Aside from you and your boyfriend, yeah.”\n“He’s just my partner,” Vlora said. She realized her mistake too late as\nNohan’s eyes moved up and down her body. His nose twitched, and he none\ntoo subtly removed a powder charge from his breast pocket and cut the end\nwith his thumb, sniffing delicately. Vlora did the same, almost laughing at\nthe thought of a powder mage after-dinner club where they all sat around\ndrinking and running powder trances.\nShe could see the thoughts turning in his head, and decided to press her\nown questions before he could come on to her. “I’m told you’re working for\nJezzy.”\n“That’s right.”\n“I spoke with Burt a few nights ago. I think he pays a lot more than\nJezzy.”\n“He might,” Nohan admitted. “I didn’t check. But Jezzy’s got the upper\nhand. I like to get paid and end up on the winning side.”\n“I’m guessing you know that I already turned Jezzy down, right?” Vlora\nasked.\nNohan barked a laugh. “Heard what you did to poor Dorner. Your\npartner did him a favor skewering him. Living a life with no tongue?” He\nclicked his tongue twice, then laughed again. The sound was tinged with\ncruelty.\n“I turned down Burt, too, if that’s why you’re here. I’m not interested in\nworking for either of them, so you can go back to your boss and tell her.”\nVlora finished her glass and raised it to Nohan. “I appreciate the drink, but\nI’m not for sale.” She turned to go, deciding it was best to withdraw from\nthis before he could get a chance to try for blood.\nNohan snatched her by the arm. “That’s not why I’m here, lover.”\n“Excuse me?” Vlora felt her chest grow tight. His grip was too firm, his\ntone too familiar."

His grip was too firm, his\ntone too familiar.\n“I’m here to offer you and your partner something a little different.”\n“Which is?”\nNohan leaned forward until their faces were almost touching and spoke\nin a low, conspiratorial tone. “We’ve got three powder mages here. Three of\nus, we could gut this whole damned town. Pick ’em off, cut ’em down.\nDoesn’t matter how, we’ve got the strength.”\n“I’m not sure what you’re suggesting,” Vlora said, though she had an\ninkling. The sparkle in Nohan’s eye when he said “cut ’em down” was just\na little too obvious.\n“I’m talking a slaughter. We take out the big bosses, get their two armies\nfighting each other, and we set fire to the town and go a-hunting. We kill\neverything with two legs and there’ll be no one to stop us from loading up a\nmule train with gold and heading for the coast. We’ll be in Gurla, living like\nkings, before anyone knows what’s happened.”\nVlora’s fingers itched for her sword. “That’s … quite an offer.”\n“I know,” he said with a grin.\n“You already took Jezzy’s coin.”\n“So?”\n“If you’re willing to betray one partner, why the pit would I trust you?”\nNohan tightened his grip on her arm. “Because you’re strong. You’re a\nmage, like me. I’m not stupid. I won’t betray someone who can fight back.”\nVlora looked down at his hand on her arm for several long seconds.\nWhen she decided she’d calmed down, she jerked away from his grasp.\n“That’s about the most cowardly thing I’ve ever heard someone say.”\nNohan’s grin disappeared. His expression changed to baffled, then\ndisgusted in an instant. “What are you, some kind of hero? Nobody gets\nanything in this life they don’t take with force. And we’ve got the force to\ntake it.”\n“I work for my money, thank you,” Vlora said quietly. “I’m not a\ncowardly dog, biting the hand and stealing the scraps.”\n“Bitch,” Nohan snarled.\n“I’ve been called worse by better.”\nIt didn’t surprise her when Nohan took a swing. Vlora caught his wrist,\nbut was forced back a step by the power of the blow. He was running a\npowder trance just like her, and was physically much larger. Her sorcery\nwasn’t an advantage here.\nHe moved quickly, swinging his other hand with the glass still in it. She\nducked, kicking out his leg, the glass catching her a glancing blow across\nthe back of the head. She heard the sound of glass shattering and brought\nher fist up hard and fast, connecting with his chin with enough force to lift\nhim off the ground and lay any grown man out cold.\nHe caught himself on a table, shaking off a daze, and came at her quick.\nOnly preternatural senses allowed her to sense the movement of his sorcery,\nleaping out to set off her powder like a finger on a hair trigger.

She fought\nback mentally, suppressing his ability to detonate powder with her mind\nwhile fending off a series of powerful blows that sent her retreating across\nthe bar.\nThe bartender leapt into a backroom, slamming the door, while the few\noccupants cleared out. Nohan’s fingers went for her throat, and Vlora kneed\nhim between the legs and grabbed the lapels of his jacket, swinging him\naround and into the beam holding up the roof with enough force that there\nwas an audible crack.\nOnce again, Nohan shook it off. He regained his feet and fell into a\nboxer’s stance, one fist forward. “I gave you a chance,” he said, jabbing.\nVlora jerked back from the blow, imitating his stance and slamming her fist\ninto his gut three times before he could get an arm around her head and\nthrow her away from him. She hit the bar headfirst, seeing stars, and barely\nrecovered before he came at her again.\nShe held her arms up in defensive posture, taking a pummeling before\ngetting an opening of her own and grabbing him by the throat. She lifted\nhim over her head, powering forward, and slammed him through a table\nwith all her strength.\nShe didn’t bother going for her pistol. Both of them could prevent\npowder from igniting a spark. Instead, she drew her sword and leapt toward\nhim, intent on putting a blade through his eye. He was quick, snapping\naway from the thrust and rolling to his feet. He struggled to draw his own\nsword as he dodged Vlora’s thrusts.\nVlora became more frustrated. She’d fought a lot of quick people, and\nsparred with powder mages, but the frustration of having someone dodge\nyour attack so easily mounted quickly. The irony, she realized in the back of\nher head, was not enjoyable.\nShe missed on a thrust, and Nohan kicked her hard in the chest, sending\nher reeling across the bar. He finally drew his own sword but made no\nmotion to advance.\nThey both panted from the fight. “I was a member of the Starlish\nCabal,” he said. “We could have worked well together, but you passed up a\nchance at real riches.” He spat at her feet. “Watch your back.” Without\nwarning, he suddenly broke and ran, pushing his way out the door and into\nthe street.\nVlora considered giving chase, but her leg hurt from a kick to her shin,\nand her vision was slightly blurry. She felt the back of her head where the\nglass had broken, only for her fingers to come away covered in crimson.\nFinding her hat in the ruin of the barroom, she limped out the door and into\nthe street.\nShe was almost to her hotel when she spotted a face in the crowd. It\ntouched something in the back of her memory, but she couldn’t quite put\nher finger on it. It was almost an hour later, when she’d cleaned herself up\nand retreated to her room, that the face suddenly attached itself to a name.\nShe swore loudly, feeling furious that she hadn’t recognized him earlier:\nPrime Lektor, former dean of Adopest University and onetime ally of Field"

What kind of terrible bloody\nluck did she have for him to show up here now?\nSeeing someone like Prime Lektor in the same town as a godstone\ncouldn’t possibly be a coincidence.\nCHAPTER 27\nB\nellport is under siege.”\nStyke jerked awake, realizing he’d been nodding off at the reins, and\nblinked the sleep out of his eyes. The Mad Lancers stretched down the road\nin a column behind and ahead of him, with Jackal and his banner a dozen\npaces back and Ibana nowhere to be seen. Celine and Ka-poel rode together\nnearby, the latter teaching Celine her sign language.\nStyke yawned and turned toward the woman addressing him. He didn’t\nknow her name, but she wore the crimson and blue of the Riflejack cavalry\nand she waited for an answer with a cool, professional air.\n“How far out are we?” he asked, casting about for a landmark that he\nmight recognize.\n“Less than five miles.”\nStyke considered his options. They could swing down south, skirting\nBellport and the Dynize Army and be well past them by noon tomorrow.\nBut Bellport was their last chance to rest and resupply before heading out\nonto the Hammer and it was a good place to recruit.\nAnd there was the matter of the traitor Valyaine. Perhaps he should just\nget that over with.\n“Take me to Gustar,” Styke told her.\nStyke ordered a halt and rode ahead with the messenger, finding Gustar\nand a group of his dragoons hidden in a glen about two miles to the east of\nBelltower. Styke left his horse and climbed to the lip of the nearest hill,\nwhere Gustar was crouched among the shrubbery with a looking glass in\nhand. He offered it to Styke as he approached.\nBellport was a coastal city located at the mouth of a small, swift-moving\nriver. Its port was built behind a tall hill that effectively protected the city\nfrom a seaward attack, and the north side was watched over by a stone\nfortress built by the Starlish almost two hundred years ago. The gun towers\nwere outdated but effective, forcing an enemy army to approach from the\nsouth.\nThis seemed to suit the Dynize just fine. They were camped just under a\nmile south of the river, bombarding the suburbs and old city walls with\nartillery and the sorcery of what looked to be a single Privileged. Styke\nguessed the army at about five thousand infantry with a few hundred\ncavalry support. They were camped on the sandy floodplain, and he amused\nhimself with the thought of a torrential rain carrying them all into the ocean.\nUnfortunately, the weather was sunny and the ground dry.\n“I can’t imagine the garrison lasting much longer,” Gustar said. “A day,\nmaybe two at best.” He pointed to a smoldering ruin in the corner of the\ncity where the river let into the ocean. “That was their biggest south-facing\nguntower and it went down about two hours ago.

Belltower has a few four-\npounders on that hill over there”—he pointed again—“but nothing else\noutside the old fortress. Once they go down, the Dynize just have to cross\nthe river.”\n“So you think they’re done for?” Styke asked. From what he could see,\nhe didn’t disagree.\nGustar nodded. “Unless we intervene soon, the smart option is to head\naround to the south and be past them by tomorrow night. They’ll be too\nbusy securing the city to chase us—and they’ve only got a few hundred\ncavalry anyway.”\nStyke twirled his lancers’ ring, considering. There was a lot of smoke\nrising from the southern suburbs, but the northern half of the city was still\nuntouched and full of people he could save. “I don’t want to leave an enemy\nbehind us,” he said. “The Dynize already have Swinshire. If we let them\ntake Bellport, we’ll be completely cut off on the Hammer.”\nTo his surprise, Gustar smiled. “I was hoping you’d say that. Hit ’em\nfrom the rear and they won’t see what’s coming. I’m only worried about the\nPrivileged. We don’t have a powder mage to put a bullet in their head.”\nStyke handed Gustar back his looking glass. “Leave the Privileged to\nme.”\nThe Mad Lancers swung south, using the hills beyond the floodplain as\ncover and coming up directly behind the Dynize position to slam into their\nsupply train at a gallop. Styke gave the order to keep formation tight and\nonly slow enough to kill anyone who raised a weapon. Then they came over\nthe hills and found themselves less than a hundred yards from the rear lines\nof the enemy infantry.\nStyke paused long enough to assess the situation, and was surprised to\nfind Ka-poel riding up to him through the chaos they’d left of the Dynize\ntrain.\n“You need to be back with our reserves,” he said. “Find Sunin and\nCeline. Stay with them.”\nKa-poel shook her head emphatically and showed him her slate. Enemy\nbone-eye.\nStyke inhaled sharply. He was familiar enough with Privileged to know\nwhen to show caution and when to charge. But he was not familiar with\nbone-eyes beyond the ones in Landfall who’d kept the Dynize lines from\nbreaking. “Will they be dangerous to our men?”\nKa-poel shrugged and spread her arms. I don’t know.\nStyke ground his teeth. “All right, change of plans. You’re coming with\nme. Stay on horseback and stay close. We’re going to kill the Privileged\nfirst, then run down the bone-eye.” He flipped his reins and raced to the\nedge of the hilltop, where the Mad Lancers had just finished spreading out\ninto a line formation. The old lancers were on the left flank, led by Ibana,\nwith the Riflejacks on the center and right, Gustar out on their wing. New\nrecruits were mixed in equally.\nStyke rode past the old lancers and pointed. “Gamble, Jackal, Chraston,\nFerlisia. Bring your boys and follow me. We have a Privileged to kill.”"

We have a Privileged to kill.”\nStyke took command of the center with about two dozen of the old\nlancers directly behind him and Ka-poel at his side. Down on the\nfloodplains some of the Dynize infantry had just noticed them and were\ndesperately trying to get the attention of their officers.\n“Send ’em to the pit!” Styke roared.\nAmrec leapt forward. They galloped down the hill, flying over the soft\ngrass and leveling out on the plain. Mere seconds passed before he drew his\ncarbine, fired off a shot, then exchanged the weapon for his lance. Carbine\nblasts went off all around him, and the Dynize lines turned in a panic,\nattempting to fix their bayonets.\nThey were too late.\nThe tip of Styke’s lance tore through a woman’s shoulder as she tried to\nraise her musket, and her companion fell beneath Amrec’s hooves a split\nsecond later. The sound of the line being trampled beneath iron-shod hooves\nmade Styke’s heart sing, and he dug his knees into Amrec’s sides.\nThey were through the rear lines in moments. Styke raised his lance,\ngesturing for the old lancers he’d set aside to follow him as he slowed and\ncut sharply mere yards behind his own left flank. Amrec leapt the bodies of\ncrushed Dynize soldiers, and they swung out wide, beyond the lines of\nDynize infantry that began to organize as the charge faltered.\nStyke checked over his shoulder to see if Ka-poel was still with him,\nonly to find her at his side. Her horse foamed at the mouth from the hard\nrun, and her brow was furrowed with concentration.\n“The trick to killing a Privileged,” Styke shouted to her, “is to take them\nby surprise. Privileged are just like any other fool—in the middle of the\nbattle they get tunnel vision. Any minute now someone is going to turn him\naway from his bombardment and direct him at the lancers. Our goal is to\nreach him before—”\nStyke’s words were cut off by a sudden jet of flame shooting across the\nbattlefield. It was startlingly close and heading toward the Mad Lancer line\nwhere Styke had been mere moments before. Dynize and cavalry alike were\nconsumed, and the air was filled with the screams of men and horses and\nthe sickening smell of charred flesh.\n“Before that happens!” Styke finished, sawing hard on the reins and\ndirecting his small squad of lancers back into the chaotic line of Dynize\nsoldiers. They plowed the poor bastards down with the force of their charge,\nnot even bothering to lower their lances. Styke caught the scent of\nbrimstone on the wind and followed his nose. He soon saw the flash of\nwhite gloves among the teal uniforms and shiny breastplates. “Lances!” he\nbellowed.\nHis small entourage sprang into a V formation, lances lowering. The\nPrivileged’s bodyguard was turned toward the main attack, and they didn’t\nsee Styke’s flanking maneuver until the last moment. The sound of horses"

The sound of horses\nhitting soldiers was an audible crack, and Styke saw a gloved hand flash\nupward and wave toward him.\nHis lance struck the Privileged in the left eye and came out the back of\nhis skull, tearing the entire side of his face off as Styke’s momentum carried\nhim onward. Styke whooped loudly, laughing as blood spattered across his\nstolen breastplate and Amrec’s mane. “Where is the bone-eye?” he shouted\nat Ka-poel.\nKa-poel’s horse suddenly leapt out in front of Amrec, and Styke found\nhimself following her as she clung closely to her horse’s neck, weaving the\ncreature expertly through lines of confused soldiers. He could smell the\ncopper of her sorcery, trying to differentiate it from the other bone-eye’s,\nbut soon realized that he shouldn’t have bothered.\nStill clinging closely to her horse, Ka-poel drew a machete with one\nhand and leaned down, letting her speed carry the blade into the back of a\nwoman’s neck. The woman spun, blood spurting, and fell to the ground\nwith a cry. Ka-poel immediately jerked back on the reins, and Styke had to\ndo the same to keep from plowing into her. She leapt from her horse and\nstraddled the woman, finishing the job with two blows from her machete.\nThe Dynize soldiers, who until now had been confused but not\ndisorganized, broke with a suddenness that shocked Styke. They began to\nrun immediately, throwing down their weapons and fleeing. Styke drew his\nsword and laid about him until there was nothing else to swing at, then took\na moment to breathe.\nCleaning the blood from his face, he watched as the Mad Lancers\ncrushed the Dynize against the river.\n“Two hundred of ours dead,” Ibana reported. “Twice that many again\nwounded.”\nStyke nodded at the number, pleased. He sat astride Amrec, flanked by\nIbana and Gustar while the lancers mopped up what remained of the Dynize\nforces. As he’d expected, killing the Privileged had been as simple as\nflanking the bodyguard. So few people were brave enough—or stupid\nenough—to charge directly at a Privileged that it was surprisingly easy to\ntake them unaware.\nThe bone-eye, however, had been the breaking force. He remembered\nthat particular sorcery from Landfall, how the Dynize had been impossible\nto break until enough of their bone-eyes had died. Their will had shattered\nwith the same suddenness here.\n“You know,” he said to Ibana, “the Dynize at Windy River didn’t break\nlike this. They were tough bastards, even after Flint put them through the\ngrinder.”\n“The army at Windy River didn’t have a bone-eye,” Ibana said.\n“Right. Logically, they should have broken faster, like these guys did\nwhen their bone-eye died.”\nIbana seemed to consider the conundrum. “Maybe they’re trained very\nwell. Naturally tough. A bone-eye strengthens their will but makes them\nbrittle so that when the bone-eye dies, they are temporarily weak.”\nStyke turned to look at her, surprised by the observation."

A bone-eye strengthens their will but makes them\nbrittle so that when the bone-eye dies, they are temporarily weak.”\nStyke turned to look at her, surprised by the observation.\n“I’ve been giving this thought since Windy River,” Ibana admitted. “A\nfew years back I read a book on the effect sorcery has on the human mind.\nIt was mostly incomprehensible rubbish, but I took away a few things.”\n“I’ll be damned.”\nIbana gave him one of her rare smiles.\n“I mean,” Styke continued, “I didn’t know you could read.”\nIbana leaned over and punched him hard in the shoulder.\nGustar finished taking a report from one of his cuirassiers and turned\ntoward them. “A Privileged, a bone-eye, and an entire brigade shattered in\nexchange for a few hundred men? That’s a damned fine trade, Colonel.\nCongratulations.” Gustar’s Riflejacks had taken the brunt of the Privileged’s\nsorcery, but he, too, seemed very pleased with the results. “I think the boys\nhave earned a day off in Bellport.”\n“I don’t disagree,” Ibana said.\nStyke eyed the gates of Bellport. They had opened moments before, and\nhe’d spied a small force riding out to greet them under a Fatrastan flag.\n“Strip the dead and wounded of supplies,” he ordered. “Grab everything we\ncan carry from the Dynize supply train. We’ll camp here tonight and give\nthe men leave in the city in the morning, then move the next day.”\nIn the meantime, Styke had personal business to attend to.\nCHAPTER 28\nM\nichel sat on the floor of his room in the Merryweather Hotel in Upper\nLandfall. Since the occupation, the hotel had been taken over by midlevel\nDynize bureaucrats unable to get a proper townhome near the capitol\nbuilding. It was a posh place, far above his old pay grade, but he’d managed\nto use Yaret’s name to secure a room there—and to take advantage of the\nfact the hotel was well guarded and unlikely to be infiltrated by Blackhats\nattempting to take his head.\nThe contents of Forgula’s pocketbook were spread in front of him: seven\nDynize ration cards, a bundle of cigarette rolling papers, a number of\nFatrastan and Dynize coins, and a booklet filled with names and addresses\non both sides of the ocean as well as a calendar of appointments.\nIt was the appointments that Michel had spent the last couple of days\nporing over. Everything in the book was written in Dynize shorthand and a\nsort of minimal cypher, and it had taken him and Tenik together two\nafternoons just to establish a working translation.\nMichel stared at the calendar of appointments, reading over the last three\nweeks for the umpteenth time. He started from one point in time—the hour\nthat Forgula met with Marhoush in Claden Park—and worked backward,\ntrying to find a similarity between the three letters and two numbers she’d\nused to mark that appointment with any other appointment since the\ninvasion. He was searching for a trail: evidence that Forgula had met with\nMarhoush many times in the past or would again in the future.\nHe finished his examination as the door to his room opened and Tenik\nslipped inside."

It seems he’s being cautious since we\nraided his last hideout.”\n“Are we certain that he’s staying put?”\n“As certain as can be. One of our people saw his face less than two\nhours ago. He has people coming and going, but seems to have remained in\none spot himself.”\nMichel snorted. “Damned fool. If he really thinks we’re on to him, he\nshould be moving every chance he gets. Staying in one spot makes it easier\nto find him. I’ve been telling the Blackhats for years that everyone should\nhave some espionage training.”\n“I take it they didn’t listen?”\n“They wouldn’t even let me give our actual spies enough training.”\nMichel rubbed his eyes. They felt tired and bloodshot after spending so\nmuch time staring at paper. He needed to get up, go out onto the balcony—\nmaybe even take a walk. He dismissed the notion. No time—and no need to\nput a target on himself. It had occurred to him last night just how much of a\nrisk he’d taken by following Hendres himself. He should have pointed her\nout to some of Yaret’s men and let them do the footwork. The more time he\nspent out among the populace, the greater chance he had of being\nrecognized, even with his dyed hair and new mustache.\n“Tell our watchers to keep their distance. I don’t want Marhoush getting\nspooked. The sooner he moves, the more chance we have of following him\ndirectly to je Tura.” Stifling a yawn, Michel wondered if he shouldn’t go\nspend the next few days watching Marhoush’s new safe house. He was,\nafter all, the one who would recognize anyone else of importance.\nThere was just too much work to do.\n“Any progress there?” Tenik asked, nodding at the calendar of\nappointments.\n“Nothing,” Michel responded. He picked up the book, tapping a pen\nagainst a bookmarked page. “We have her shorthand here for the meeting\nwith Marhoush, and we figured out last night her system for marking\nnames, places, and dates. But I haven’t found a single match for Marhoush\nanywhere else in her calendar. She’s either never met with him before or\nthis was the only time she actually jotted the meeting down.”\n“And if it’s the former?”\n“If it’s the former”—Michel tapped the pen against the page—“then\nmaybe our first guess was right. Perhaps Forgula is attempting to turn\nMarhoush directly. She’s not a traitor, or up to anything more insidious than\nrecruiting an enemy. Which is exactly what we’ve been doing.”\nTenik seemed doubtful. “Either way, Yaret wants to know.”\n“That’s fair.” Michel continued to tap away, considering his options.\nThere might be something in this calendar that he missed—a hidden\nmessage jotted between the lines. Invisible ink. Even sorcery. But Forgula"

        "text": "“That’s fair.” Michel continued to tap away, considering his options.\nThere might be something in this calendar that he missed—a hidden\nmessage jotted between the lines. Invisible ink. Even sorcery. But Forgula\ndidn’t have easy access to that kind of sorcery and this was, after all, just a\ncalendar. She wasn’t high-ranking enough to think it would be lifted by a\npickpocket. This was probably a dead end.\nHe tossed the calendar aside and picked up Forgula’s thin address book.\nThis wasn’t in shorthand or lightly ciphered, not like the calendar. It was\nsimply a list of contacts and addresses, just like any government aide might\ncarry with them. He’d flipped through it twice now and nothing had struck\nhim as peculiar. But late last night, it had given him an idea.\n“Do you have access to census records?” Michel asked.\n“I do.”\n“I need the records of all the bureaucrats and civilians who came over\nfrom Dynize.”\nTenik’s eyebrows furrowed. “What do you need those for?”\nMichel shook the address book over his head. “Because I want to\ncompare her address book to the census records. If I can eliminate all the\npeople who came with you from overseas, then I’ll be able to tell who her\nlocal contacts are. From there, we can find out if any of them are known\nBlackhats and we’ll have a new trail to follow.”\nTenik walked over to the window, pushing aside the curtain and looking\nout for a few moments before answering. “Can’t you differentiate between\nFatrastan names and Dynize names?”\n“In a pinch, yes. But I don’t know every Dynize name, and you don’t\nknow every Kressian, Fatrastan, or Palo name. I’m not going to look for\nevery single name—just the ones I’m curious about. It’ll be a couple hours\nof work at most, and might save me a boatload of time in the future.”\nOr, Michel added silently, I could just look for the latest entries in her\naddress book. But that wouldn’t allow him to get his hands on the census\ndata. He waited for Tenik to tell him he was being obtuse, watching\ncarefully for an ounce of suspicion.\nTenik shrugged. “If you wish. There is a single book that lists every\ncivilian that came over with the army. I can get a copy to you within thirty\nminutes. I’m not sure it’ll be as helpful as you think, but I’ll provide it.”\n“And someone to help me compare the names,” Michel added, hoping it\nwould allay any suspicion.\n“Of course.”\nTenik headed to the door, but stopped suddenly and turned to Michel.\nMichel swallowed hard, waiting for a sudden accusation, but Tenik had\nsomething else on his mind. “A warning to you, my friend.”\n“Eh?”\n“Ichtracia has been asking about you. Your stunt with Forgula last night\nhas piqued her interest.”\nMichel’s throat began to feel tight. “She doesn’t have better things to\ndo?”\n“Most of the Privileged are with the army,” Tenik said with a shrug.\n“Ichtracia remains with the government because of her grandfather’s\nwishes, but there isn’t a lot for a Privileged to do in a new seat of"

Aside from the odd task that comes her way, she finds … other\ndiversions.”\n“And you’re worried I might be a new diversion?”\n“Just warning you that she’s been asking around, is all.” Tenik raised his\neyebrows. “However, I suppose everyone’s been asking around about you.\nBefore, you were a curiosity. Since you confronted Forgula, you’ve\nsuddenly become very interesting.”\nTenik left Michel alone with the contents of Forgula’s pocketbook,\nwhich he spent the next little while glancing through once more before\nthere was a knock on the door. A young woman arrived with the census data\nMichel requested. She was one of Yaret’s Household clerks who’d picked\nup a little Palo and Adran, and they spent the rest of the evening comparing\nForgula’s address book with the census data.\nThe work was tedious. They marked each person as either Dynize or\nFatrastan, then went back through and double-checked all of the names.\nOnly thirteen—all of them written in at the end of the address book—were\nFatrastan, and most of those were readily recognizable sympathizers\nalready helping the Dynize stabilize the government.\nMichel didn’t much care about the information. It might be useful, but\nhis real goal was to look through the census data himself. He scoured it\nwhenever his assistant didn’t need the book. He sorted through the tiny\nwriting, poring over it like he might check the books of a crooked\naccountant, looking for any sign of this “Mara” whom Taniel needed\nsmuggled out of the city. After four hours he bought himself some more\ntime with the book by ordering his assistant to triple-check the list that\nthey’d made, and at the end of the fifth hour he gave the book to her and\nsent her back to the Yaret Household.\nHe stood by the hotel room window in frustration, watching as the\nevening guard did their rounds. He considered his path to this place,\nwondering at the idea that he was now working for a powerful Dynize\nminister, and he tried to imagine where Taniel and Ka-poel were now.\nHe wished that Taniel was here. He had questions—questions he hadn’t\nknown he would need to ask.\nThe first had to do with all the data he’d just scoured. Of the thousands\nof civilians who had come over with the army to occupy Landfall, he\ncouldn’t find Mara. And not just the Mara … but he couldn’t even find a\nMara. It was as if the name itself didn’t even exist.\nWhich forced him to wonder what the pit he was going to do if he\ncouldn’t even find this woman.\nCHAPTER 29\nT\nhe Yellow Creek jail was one of the few brick buildings in the city,\npositioned just behind the mayor’s office at the end of a long street that\nterminated a hundred yards later at the base of one of the mountains. It was\nbigger than Vlora expected, with over two dozen holding cells guarded by a\nhandful of deputies, all of whom kept a wary eye on Vlora as she was led\ndown the hall to the last cell on the right."

Taniel\nsat cross-legged on the bed, shoes off, jacket tossed over a chair as if he was\nstaying in a hotel room instead of a cell. His brow was furrowed as he drew\nin his sketchbook, and he didn’t look up until the cell door was unlocked.\n“Afternoon,” he said cheerfully.\nVlora paused in the doorway, noting that the guard had left the two of\nthem alone. “Looks like you’re living the high life in here.”\n“It’s a cell for important people,” Taniel explained.\n“And you are?”\n“A man with money.”\nVlora took the chair and pursed her lips at Taniel. “And you mocked me\nfor paying for two rooms at the hotel.”\n“Nobody’s perfect.” Taniel flipped the page in his sketchbook, then\nlifted his chin, looking down his nose at her. She remembered that look.\n“You’re not drawing me,” she said.\n“Of course not,” he replied as he began to sketch.\nVlora let it go. “Do they know who you are?” she asked quietly.\n“They think my name is Tampo.” He paused to adjust the glove on his\nright hand, revealing a bit of red skin.\n“And that?” Vlora asked, nodding at the hand.\n“One Palo deputy knows who I am. She’s a Daughter of the Red Hand\nand knows the passwords, so I can trust her, but I haven’t been able to get\nmuch more than the city gossip and good meals. Speaking of which, I heard\nyou met with the other big boss. Why do they call him Brown Bear Burt?”\n“Has a big bearskin on his desk. Claims he got a lucky shot off at an\nIronhook grizzly years ago and the name stuck.”\n“And Burt? It’s an Adran name.”\n“No idea. Palo here call themselves anything they want. How did you\nhear that, anyway? The gossip in this city is out of control.”\nTaniel glanced up at her with a frown, pausing, before continuing his\nsketch. Vlora turned her face the other direction to annoy him. He didn’t\nseem to mind. “There’s ten thousand people crammed into a tiny valley in\nthe middle of nowhere. Not much to do here besides poke your nose in\nother people’s business. Did you find it?”\nVlora shook her head. “I’ve checked two of the big valleys and a dozen\nof the little ones. Been at it all morning, too. But there are a few things you\nneed to know.”\n“What’s that?”\n“There’s another powder mage in Yellow Creek.”\nTaniel looked up sharply. “Oh?”\n“A man named Nohan. Claimed he was in the Starlish Cabal. Ever heard\nof him?”\n“I haven’t. Starlish, eh? They integrated their cabal, what, four years\nago?”\n“Six,” Vlora corrected. “Privileged and powder mages, fighting side by\nside in a royal cabal.”\n“Times change.” Taniel shrugged. “You met him?”\n“He came on to me last night.”"

He didn’t take my rejection well.”\n“I’m guessing you did it with your usual grace?”\n“I called him a coward.”\n“Well done,” Taniel said without a trace of sarcasm. “Sounds like it was\nwarranted.”\n“It was, but it means that we have a powder mage to look out for. I tried\nto make it clear I wasn’t his enemy, but he took the ‘coward’ bit personally\nand we beat the shit out of each other.”\nTaniel squinted at her over his sketchbook. “Oh yeah. I didn’t notice that\nshiner when you walked in. So we have a rogue powder mage with a grudge\nin addition to all this other shit.” He finally set down his charcoal and\nrubbed his eyes, leaning back in the cell bed. He let his gaze wander around\nhis cell, his cool demeanor broken by a distasteful sneer. “This is incredibly\ninconvenient.”\n“I would appreciate help.”\n“I tried bribing the sheriff to see the judge earlier,” Taniel said. “No can\ndo. And she made it very clear that the moment I’m out of this cell, we\nwon’t be welcome in this town anymore.”\nVlora quelled a rising frustration. “Meaning I have to look for this thing\non my own? And I only have until you get out?”\n“Sounds like it,” Taniel said with an apologetic smile.\n“You’re the one with Ka-poel’s damned compass in your head.”\n“Little good it’s done me. I spent a whole night looking for the artifact.\nAll I can tell is that it’s here. I don’t know where, though. One other thing\n…” He hesitated. “The sheriff says there’s a good chance they’ll try to hang\nme. The local judge has been trying to crack down on violence.”\n“Pit,” Vlora breathed. She wasn’t worried for Taniel’s fate. She was\nworried that he would kill a whole lot of innocent people when they tried to\ncarry out the sentence. The ticking clock in the back of her head just got\nlouder. All she could do was hurry. She made a sour face, thinking back to\nthe figure she recognized in the street last night. “What can you tell me\nabout the Predeii?”\nThat got Taniel’s attention. He closed his sketchbook and set it to one\nside, scooting to the edge of the bed. “That’s not a question I want to hear,”\nhe said intently. “I don’t know anything about them, not any more than you\n—powerful Privileged that were responsible for summoning the gods to\ngive order to the Nine, then responsible for the chaos that occurred once the\ngods left.”\n“How powerful?” Vlora asked.\n“Worth half a royal cabal on their own, is what Bo told me,” Taniel\nanswered. He tilted his face to one side, watching Vlora cautiously. “What\naren’t you telling me?”"

He tilted his face to one side, watching Vlora cautiously. “What\naren’t you telling me?”\n“I saw Prime Lektor last night.”\nTaniel leaned on his fist, swaying to one side. “No,” he breathed. “We\ncan’t afford to have them involved with this, too. You’re absolutely\ncertain?”\n“I recognized him in the street,” Vlora said, suddenly feeling less sure of\nherself. “It wasn’t until a couple hours later that I realized where I\nrecognized him from. I think it was him, but I won’t be sure unless I see\nhim again.”\n“And I’ll bet my boots he’ll recognize you if he sees you first.”\nVlora swore under her breath. This damned city seemed to be getting\nsmaller every day. First the spat between the big bosses, then a powder\nmage, and now a mythical Privileged older than her birth country. “If it is\nhim, it can’t be a coincidence.”\n“He’s here for the stone.”\n“Of course. What else could it be?” Vlora asked with a shrug. “An\nancient sorcerer doesn’t just happen to show up in the little frontier gold-\nrush city where we’re looking for an ancient artifact of great power.”\nTaniel looked like he swallowed a lemon. “We’ve got to find him. Shit, I\nwish Ka-poel were here. Prime Lektor might be more than even I can\nhandle. I’ve fought one of the Predeii before and couldn’t kill her.” He\npaused. “Why would Prime Lektor want the stone?”\n“Power?”\n“He’s an academic. Maybe he’s trying to keep it out of Lindet’s hands.\nMaybe he just wants to study it.”\n“That,” Vlora said, “is too stupidly optimistic for me. We have to\nassume he’s an enemy.”\n“Agreed.”\n“Do I try to put a bullet in his head?”\n“If that’ll even work,” Taniel snorted. “Pit.”\n“You could get out any time you like,” Vlora pointed out.\n“With violence,” Taniel admitted. “But yes. The city will close to us the\nmoment I leave this cell, either by force or judicial order. I’ll cool my feet\nfor the time being, and see what kind of information my Palo friend can get\nme. I’ve got to be careful who I trust with the Red Hand information. I still\nhave quite a bounty on my head.”\n“I’m going to look for Prime Lektor. If he’s here, then he might already\nknow where the godstone is.”\n“Be careful,” Taniel warned, raising his finger. “We don’t know what\nhe’s capable of. One of those Predeii carved through half of Tamas’s\npowder cabal back during the coup.”\nVlora remembered. Those people were her friends and comrades. “She\ntook them by surprise,” she said, hoping there wasn’t too much hubris in\nher bravado. “I intend on taking him by surprise.”\n“And that powder mage?”\n“Him, too.”\nTaniel scowled, his expression uncertain. “I should get out of here.”"

She could do this. She had to do this. Taniel’s help\nwould be ideal, but she still didn’t fully trust his motives. If she could make\nthis victory her own, it would be worth so much more. “You can’t attract\nattention. I’ll find Prime and the stone by the time you’re out of here.” She\nstood up. “But I need to use every minute to do it.”\nTaniel took her hand, surprising her. “Vlora,” he said seriously, “don’t\nget yourself killed. There’s more going on here than we know. My Palo\nfriend says that the Palo Nation has a presence here, but he doesn’t know\nanything else. If we can contact them, we might be able to get some help.”\nVlora didn’t know the first thing about getting in touch with agents of\nthis Palo Nation. “I’m not exactly a welcome figure in the Palo\ncommunity.”\n“They don’t give a shit about the southern Palo. They only care if you\ncan help them.”\n“And can I help them?” She really didn’t like the sound of that.\n“Maybe.” Taniel seemed torn. “I’ll see what I can find out from here.\nJust … be careful.”\nCHAPTER 30\nS\ntyke was greeted by the mayor of Belltower as he entered the old city\ngates the day after the Mad Lancers relieved the city. The mayor was an\nolder gentleman with the dark skin of a Deliv, distinguished in tails and hat,\nwith spectacles perched on the end of his nose. He wore a red sash\nproclaiming his title, and he was on foot surrounded by a small entourage of\ndignitaries dressed in their churchgoing best. As Styke rode through the\ngates, the mayor swept off his hat and bowed.\nThere was a part of Styke that reveled in his fame, that enjoyed the\nwomen, booze, and money his reputation had gotten him in his youth. But\nbeing thanked had always felt strained and awkward. He tipped his hat in\nreturn and gave a small wave to the dignitaries.\n“You’re Colonel Styke,” the mayor said.\nStyke glanced over his shoulder, hoping that Ibana would arrive with\nsome kind of emergency that needed his attention. Ka-poel lurked on\nhorseback a few dozen feet behind him. Other than her and Celine, there\nwere only a few of his lancers riding in to see the city, and they slunk off\nquickly without making eye contact.\nThe cowards.\nStyke lowered Celine to the ground and dismounted, handing her\nAmrec’s reins. He shook the mayor’s hand, hoping his discomfort was\nobvious enough that the group would bugger off.\n“My name’s Witbee,” the mayor introduced himself. “Mayor Witbee.\nIt’s a pleasure to meet you, Colonel Styke, and I must immediately\napologize that the city is in no shape to give you the reception you deserve.”\nHe gestured to his entourage. “These are all we could spare to come out and\nmeet you. Everyone else is tending the wounded and putting out fires.”"

Everyone else is tending the wounded and putting out fires.”\n“No offense taken,” Styke replied. “I’m not really one for receptions, to\nbe honest.”\nThe mayor charged ahead anyway. “You arrived in the nick of time,\nColonel. We sent for help weeks ago and only just received word that the\nThird Army was on its way to relieve us. But they won’t be here for days\nand …” His expression grew strained. “Well, we wouldn’t have lasted much\nlonger. The bastards were lined up for a charge when you arrived.”\nStyke resisted the urge to reply with I noticed and instead tried for a\ngracious smile, noting that Witbee had mentioned the Third Army.\n“You charged a Privileged,” Witbee continued. “Without any of your\nown, if I’m not mistaken. I’ve never seen anything like it.”\n“Privileged die like anyone else,” Styke replied. “It’s just a matter of\ngetting close enough to put a lance through their eye.”\nThe mayor tugged at his collar, his eyes fluttering as if he were unused\nto such bold discussion of violence. He stuttered for a moment, then said,\n“I’m sorry you and your men camped out on the plain last night. I sent\nsomeone to invite you in, but they returned without an answer.”\n“I sent them away. We had bodies to strip and wounded to tend to. Look,\nMayor, I appreciate you coming out to greet me, but it’s clear that you’ve\ngot a lot of problems to deal with. I’m going to be blunt with you:\nEverything that I’ve heard says that you’re one of the only cities on the\nwest coast to survive the Dynize landing.”\nWitbee took a shaky breath. “I’ve heard similar reports. We’ve been\ndiscussing the possibility of abandoning the city and sending the people\ninland.”\n“With all due respect, that’s a terrible idea,” Styke said. “The Dynize are\nspread out, and Lindet’s field armies are finally engaging the enemy. If the\nThird Army is already on their way, they’ll need Bellport as a foothold in\nDynize territory.”\n“This … this is Dynize territory now, isn’t it?” Witbee asked, his\nexpression fraught.\nStyke pointed at the ground at their feet. “This is not Dynize territory,\nnot yet. And I suggest you not abandon it. You’ve got what, a hundred\nthousand souls in Bellport?”\n“About that, yes.”\n“Comb the city for fighting men, engineers, and labor. Conscript\neveryone you have to. Rebuild your gun platforms, even if you’ve got\nnothing to put on them—the Third Army will have extras.” Styke wracked\nhis brain for more advice, trying to remember the very same conversations\nhe’d had with politicians during the Fatrastan War for Independence. The\nsituation had been remarkably similar, except the Dynize had a lot more\nsoldiers on the continent than the Kez did back then. He took the mayor by\nthe elbow and pulled him aside, lowering his voice.\n“A word of warning: The field armies are stripping the countryside for\neverything they can get their hands on—weapons, food, practical goods.

He’ll strip you of\neverything he can.”\n“What can we do?”\n“Organize the city. Rebuild those gun platforms, reinforce the walls, and\ndig trenches. Get every craftsman in the city working toward the war effort\nand when General Dvory arrives, he’ll see a useful war asset rather than\ndead weight for him to strip of resources.”\nWitbee drew himself up. “I will do exactly as you say. I’ve served the\ngood people of Bellport faithfully for eight years. I will rally them for all\nwe have.”\n“And don’t let General Dvory push you around. Tell him that Ben Styke\nis your friend and a city protector and that I won’t stand for any\nmistreatment of Fatrastan citizens.”\n“Do you think it’ll come to that?” Witbee asked incredulously.\n“I hope not.” Styke chuckled inwardly. If it did come to that, it would\npiss off Dvory something fierce. “If he continues to press, tell him that\nLindet herself has guaranteed the city’s safety.”\n“But she has done no such thing!”\n“Consider me a mouthpiece of the Lady Chancellor herself,” Styke lied.\nHe clapped the mayor on the shoulder and turned to the retinue, raising his\nvoice so that everyone nearby could hear him. “The Mad Lancers came to\nresupply in Bellport. We’ll pay fair prices for what we need and won’t take\nwhat you can’t afford to spare. I’ll allow my men a night’s leave here before\nwe move on tomorrow. If any of them refuse to pay for services or start\nfights, they will answer to me personally.”\nHe continued. “We lost about two hundred men in that fight.” He jerked\nhis thumb over his shoulder. “We’ll lose more to wounds. Anyone with\ncourage and the ability to ride is welcome to join us when we leave\ntomorrow. If you don’t know how to fight, we’ll teach you how, and if\nyou’re looking to punch the Dynize in the teeth for what they’ve done to\nyour families and homes, I guarantee you the chance.” He nodded to\nhimself. “That’s all. Thanks, Mayor.”\nHe returned to Amrec without another word, taking the reins from\nCeline and continuing on foot into the city. People stopped and stared as he\npassed by. He kept his head down and was left unmolested, but he could\nfeel those eyes on his shoulders.\n“How did I do?” he asked Celine.\n“It was a good speech,” she said, nodding in approval.\n“I’ve never got on with politicians. Don’t have the patience or the knack\nfor obedience.”\n“My da used to say that a politician is just a money-grubbing whore who\nwon’t stoop to—”\n“That’s enough of that,” Styke cut her off. “One of these days you’re"

The lot stood outside a gunsmith’s, talking among themselves.\n“For all their need for circumspection, I’ve never met a thief who could\nshut up. Here.” Styke gave the reins back to Celine and crossed the street.\nIbana greeted him with a nod, smirking. “How’s the mayor?”\n“I think I put him off with talk of violence,” Styke replied. “But I\nprepped him for dealing with Dvory.”\nIbana’s eyebrows rose. “Dvory’s coming here?”\n“The mayor says the Third Army is a few days away.”\n“Do you want to wait for them?” Ibana had a glint in her eye, and Styke\nsuspected that if he didn’t kill Dvory fast enough for her, she’d do the job\nherself.\nStyke shook his head. “He’s in command of a whole field army. I’m not\nbringing that down on our heads right now. There will be plenty of time for\ngutting him when the fighting is done. What’s going on here?”\nIbana gestured to the gunsmith. “We’ve got everything we need except\nreplacement carbines. We’re seeing if anyone has stock in the city.”\n“How bad is it?”\n“We need a hundred. I’ll settle for twenty-five. Smiths don’t normally\nmake carbines without an order, so we’ll have to scrounge.”\n“Do what you can,” Styke said, glancing over his shoulder. Ka-poel was\nstill shadowing him, waiting in the street astride her horse. Seeing her, he\nwas struck by a tale from his childhood—a Palo legend that spoke of a\nwoman on horseback who rode into battle behind those who were fated to\ndie a violent death. He thought of the stories he’d been told of Ka-poel and\ngod killing. She would make a good angel of death.\n“Are you going somewhere?” Ibana asked.\nStyke pointed to a nearby barbership window, filled to the brim with\nplaybills announcing various shows, poetry readings, cockfights, and other\nbits of entertainment going on around the city. One of them said, in bold\nletters, VALYAINE SORIS: FIGHTER EXTRAORDINAIRE. Beneath the words was the\naddress for a boxing arena and a stylized, printed portrait of a man Styke\nrecognized well.\n“I’m going to go put a knife in another old friend.”\nCHAPTER 31\nT\nhere’s been another bombing.”\nMichel tucked Forgula’s address book underneath his menu and sat back\nin his chair in the café of the hotel lobby as Tenik slipped into the chair\nacross from him.

Tenik wore a grave expression, and Michel could instantly\ntell that something was different about this one. “Where?” he asked.\n“The northern rim of Greenfire Depths. The bomb killed seven local\nPalo leaders and the minister of rations.”\nMichel didn’t know the name of the minister of rations, but he did know\nthe title. It was the woman in charge of making sure that everyone got fed—\nfrom the army, to the occupying civilians, to the Fatrastan and Palo citizens\nof Landfall. When Michel had asked who the most important people in\nLandfall were, Tenik had listed her title among the top ten—and based on\nwhat Michel had heard, she was good at her job. But that wasn’t, Michel\nsensed, what was bothering Tenik. “She was an ally of Yaret, wasn’t she?”\n“A close ally,” Tenik confirmed. “Our Households have been friends for\ntwo hundred years. We were on the same side of the civil war.”\n“Shit.”\n“What’s worse, her successor is her nephew. He’s a capable young man,\nbut he’s back in Dynize. The fourth-in-command of the Household will\nhave to step in, and she has never gotten along with Yaret.”\nMichel wondered how that would change the power dynamic. Clearly it\nwas on Tenik’s mind as well—though Tenik obviously had a better grasp of\nwhat this would mean. The fact that he was so gray-faced didn’t bode well.\n“Does this have any effect on me?” Michel asked bluntly. It wasn’t a\nquestion with any tact, but he’d found that Tenik responded better to\ndirectness than to dancing around a topic.\n“I don’t think so,” Tenik said. “If anything, it just makes it more\nimportant that we find and stop whoever is conducting these bombings.\nRumor has it that Sedial will free up some of his own Household to help\nwith the search and give us more resources.”\nMichel quelled his natural suspicion. If Sedial was offering a hand, it\nmeant that this had gotten serious. “No strings attached?”\n“The minister of rations was well liked by everyone. Her Household will\ncontinue her work under her cupbearer, but efficiency will be lost.” Tenik\nfrowned. “No one wants ministers to die, not when we’re in such a\nprecarious position. Landfall is the hub of our invasion—Lindet has three\nfield armies within a hundred miles. Our own armies are more than a match,\nbut to guarantee victory, everything in the city must go smoothly.”\nMichel wondered, not for the first time, if Lindet had secret\ncommunications with the Blackhats here. Everything seemed just a tad too\ncoordinated for the workings of a single Gold Rose and a skeleton crew of\nsubordinates completely untrained for guerrilla warfare. “We know it’s je\nTura,” Michel said.\n“Knowing doesn’t help us at all if we don’t find him.”\n“Knowing will help us find him,” Michel said with assurance. In\naddition to trying to discover Forgula’s connection to Marhoush, he’d spent\nthe last few days coordinating almost a hundred people in a\ncounterespionage effort.

Yaret’s Household had rooted out dozens of\nBlackhat safe houses, turned a small number of Blackhats, and imprisoned\nhundreds more. But the bombings only seemed to intensify.\nThe only blessing, as Michel saw it, was that the occupied citizens\nwanted nothing to do with these bombings. Aside from a few radicals, most\nof the local leaders were decrying any violence that included civilians—and\nje Tura had made it very clear that he didn’t give a shit who his bombs\nkilled.\n“I have to go,” Tenik said. “I’ll be in touch, but you might not see me for\na couple of days.”\nMichel hid his surprise. Despite giving him quite a lot of power to hunt\ndown his former compatriots, Yaret had left Michel with a leash—namely\nTenik—that had been present for most of his time with the Dynize. Tenik\ndisappearing for a couple of days would be the most freedom Michel had\nhad since before the invasion. “What will you be doing?”\n“Coordinating with the interim minister of rations,” Tenik said\nunhappily. “And trying to convince her that it’s best for her Household to\nremain close friends with the minister of scrolls. I have no doubt that at\nleast one of Sedial’s cupbearers will be attempting to convince her that a\nfriendship with the Sedial Household would be of more benefit. Forgula\nmight even be there.”\nA woman dead by enemy hands, and the dogs just fighting over the\nscraps. It reminded Michel why he considered spying a more noble\nprofession than politics. “Anything I can do to help?”\n“Find je Tura. Put an end to the bombings.”\nTenik took his leave with those words, and Michel was once again alone\nat his little table in the hotel lobby. He glanced around at the few others in\nthe lobby. He was the only non-Dynize in this hotel, and ever since he\nmoved in, people openly stared at him as they walked past—something he\nput up with just to get out of his room. From what Tenik told him, there\nwere all sorts of rumors floating around: that Michel was a double agent\nwho’d been working for Yaret for years, or that he was still a spy and taking\nadvantage of Yaret’s good nature, or even that he was half Dynize, half Palo\n—descended from some banished nobleman.\nMichel did his best to ignore the rumors. Beyond punching Forgula in\nthe face, he had little interest in Dynize politics. Results were what he\nneeded.\nHe considered Tenik’s mention of Forgula before fetching her address\nbook from beneath his menu and heading upstairs to his room, where he\nfound her calendar sitting on his bed. He flipped through the calendar to\ntoday’s date. It was full of meetings and tasks without a single moment of\nfree time. Between her old schedule and this new disruption, Michel very\nmuch doubted that she’d be returning home any time today.\nThere were all sorts of things Michel could do while Tenik was out of\nhis hair, but he decided to do the most dangerous of them first.\nForgula’s personal address was in a small strip of workers’ homes in the\nIndustrial Quarter.

        "text": "his hair, but he decided to do the most dangerous of them first.\nForgula’s personal address was in a small strip of workers’ homes in the\nIndustrial Quarter. Unlike most of the Dynize bureaucracy, she had moved\ninto an abandoned home in Lower Landfall, in a poorer area where many of\nthe buildings were still occupied by their Fatrastan owners.\nMichel scouted out the street for a few moments, checking for anyone\nwho seemed particularly curious about his presence. At this time of day\nthings were mostly quiet—a few old ladies hanging out the laundry in the\nstreet, a handful of children playing beside one of the industrial canals, but\notherwise empty. The strip of homes where Forgula had chosen to live was\na single building about eight homes long, each of them two stories tall, the\nwhitewashed exteriors turned gray from the soot from nearby factories.\nMichel had been an informant in this part of town years ago, and he was\nquite familiar with this sort of block housing. It was mostly occupied by\nfactory foremen—lower-class workers who needed to be near their work\nand could afford a little more space for a large family.\nMichel walked up and down the street a few times before circling to the\nnarrow alley behind the strip of houses. There was a gutter and rubbish pile\nback there, reeking of shit and rotten food, but there was also a raised brick\nwalkway that accessed the barred doors of each of the houses.\nThe alley was abandoned, and Michel counted the back doors until he\nreached the address that coincided with the one written in the front of\nForgula’s address book. Standing on his tiptoes, he looked through the rear\nwindow. The place certainly seemed empty. Clearing his throat, he knocked\nloudly, waited sixty seconds, and knocked again.\nNothing.\nHe looked both directions, stepped up to the iron-barred door, and\nslipped a set of picklocks out of his pocket.\nIt took him three minutes to get through the iron barred door, another\nfour to get through the actual door beyond that. He stepped into a well-lit\nrear hallway, the floor creaking beneath his feet. “Forgula!” he called.\nThere was no answer, so Michel began his search.\nHe wasn’t entirely sure what he was searching for, but that had often\nbeen the case when he’d done this in the past. The house itself was rather\nnicely furnished; the furniture was fairly new, it had quality wallpaper, and\nthere were small luxuries scattered through the rooms, such as books,\nmirrors, and nicer clothing that was definitely Fatrastan in origin. Most\nlikely it had belonged to the mistress of a mill owner, someone who could\nafford the nicer things in life but wanted to stay near the factories.\nFurniture askew, clothing lying out, and the occasional bit of jewelry\nlying discarded on a table told the story of someone who’d packed hastily to\nflee town. Only two rooms had been tidied: the sitting room and one of the\nbedrooms upstairs, and these, Michel decided, was where Forgula was\nliving.\nThere were Dynize books on the nightstand, and uniforms and extra\nclothes in the closet that looked about Forgula’s size. There were several\nnotepads, and it only took a moment to compare the writing on them with\nthe writing in Forgula’s address book to confirm their likeness."

There were several\nnotepads, and it only took a moment to compare the writing on them with\nthe writing in Forgula’s address book to confirm their likeness.\nOnce he’d done that, he checked each room with a steady, thoughtful\neye. He looked for hidden nooks and crannies, disrupted dust, mismatched\nwallpaper—anything that would indicate a hiding spot for Forgula’s\nvaluables. He checked under shelves and sought gaps in the floorboards.\nNothing seemed out of order, so he moved on to the more mundane: the\nbed, the wardrobe, and Forgula’s sea chest.\nHe was careful to handle everything as little as possible. He memorized\nthe locations of every item before moving something, then putting it back\nexactly as it was found. The goal was to be as thorough as possible without\nletting Forgula know that he’d been here at all.\nThe search took him less than half an hour, and it revealed almost\nnothing useful—though he did learn a great deal about Forgula. Letters\nfrom her father and little sister had come with her from Dynize, as well as\ntokens of affection and a stack of unsigned love notes that looked to be a\nfew years old. Michel always struggled with this part of his job. Looking\nthrough the private parts of a person’s life often revealed a more human side\nthat he had to coldly ignore.\nOnly one item caught Michel’s interest. It was a list of addresses filed\naway with a bundle of other papers in a hidden compartment of Forgula’s\nsea chest. The addresses were most definitely in Landfall, and the paper\nlooked fairly new. A brief check against the addresses in her booklet told\nhim that this was not her standard list of contacts.\nMichel returned the bundle of papers to the sea chest—sans the list of\naddresses—and made sure everything was in its proper place. One more\nquick search of the house, and he locked the back doors and slipped out\nthrough a window, closing it carefully behind him.\nHe couldn’t help but be mildly disappointed as he left the Industrial\nQuarter on foot and climbed up the switchbacks to head back to the\nMerryweather Hotel. The list of addresses in his pocket might turn up\nsomething interesting, but it seemed that there would be no easy answers\nfor Forgula’s meetings with Marhoush. He couldn’t help but decide that she\nwas attempting to turn him—perhaps to get her own pet Blackhat and curry\nfavor with her master, Sedial. If there was nothing sinister going on, he’d\nangered Forgula for very little reason.\nHe was getting near the Hadshaw Gorge when he got the sense that he\nwas being followed.\nMichel switched directions, heading down a couple of side streets before\nreaching the main avenue that ran alongside the gorge. He was careful not\nto look directly behind him—only stopping from time to time to check his\npocket watch or look in a store window, trying to get some kind of look at\nwhoever might be on his tail. If anyone was there, they managed to elude\nhim.\nHis mood went from curious to uneasy, and he wondered if perhaps one\nof the Sedial Household or even Forgula herself had spotted him leaving\nForgula’s house. He’d wanted to spend the afternoon catching up with a few\nold contacts—the type of people Tenik would disapprove of him meeting—"

He’d wanted to spend the afternoon catching up with a few\nold contacts—the type of people Tenik would disapprove of him meeting—\nbut he couldn’t risk leading any Dynize to anyone who would raise\nsuspicions. Perhaps he should head straight back to the hotel.\nIf Forgula had spotted him, though, Michel couldn’t hole himself up\nwith other Dynize. He took a sudden turn into an alley off the busy street\nand stepped up against the wall, waiting for anyone he recognized to pass\nhim by. He slipped both hands into his pockets and fingers into his knuckle-\ndusters.\nHe waited for five minutes, then ten. He was just beginning to think his\nparanoia had gotten the best of him when he heard the sound of a pistol\ncocking behind him.\nSlowly, Michel turned to look back into the alley. Hendres stood about\nfifteen feet away, pistol raised, her face expressionless. How she had\nmanaged to sneak up on him, he had no idea, but he tried to put together a\nquick explanation for his actions—anything that might let him talk himself\nout of this. “Hendres,” he said.\n“Michel.” She breathed his name like a swear word.\n“You don’t want to fire that here,” Michel said quietly. “You’ll have\nsoldiers down on top of you in a moment. Lower the pistol and we can talk.\nI’m not what you think I am.” Slowly, so as not to risk a rash action on her\npart, he slipped his fingers out of his knuckle-dusters and raised his hands.\n“We should talk.”\n“No,” Hendres said, “we shouldn’t.”\nMichel saw the gun jump only a split second before something slammed\ninto his chest. He jerked backward and slumped against the alley wall,\nwhere he stayed for a few seconds while Hendres watched him through the\npowder smoke. She turned and ran.\nMichel frowned at the lack of pain. Had she missed? Had a misfire\ncaused the bullet to bounce off him? He touched a hand to his chest, a few\ninches below his heart. His fingers came back crimson. There was a burning\nsensation, like having a hot coal against his skin, and it took Michel’s\nsuddenly foggy mind several moments to come to terms with the fact that\nhe’d been shot.\nAnd that he would probably be dead within a few moments.\nHe stumbled to the next street, walking along with a wall on his right,\nhis fingers leaving crimson prints against the plaster as he tried to propel\nhimself on. Each step felt like a thousand miles, but he barely managed to\ngo two blocks before he fell into the rubbish beside a doorway, his eyesight\ncloudy and his mind confused. He thought he heard a voice somewhere\nbehind him and wondered if Hendres had returned to finish the job.\nEverything went black.\nCHAPTER 32\nB\nefore heading down the main avenue of Bellport, Styke approached Ka-\npoel and let her horse nuzzle his hand. “Why are you following me?” he\nasked. “Don’t you have sorcery to do somewhere?”\nShe rolled her eyes and went through a series of hand motions.\n“She says that she’s following you because you’re her protector,” Celine\nsaid, joining them with Amrec in tow."

The whole of the Mad Lancers\nis your bodyguard. You’re safer out there.”\nKa-poel pursed her lips and signed. It took several repetitions before\nCeline was able to translate a coherent sentence: A bone-eye needs a\nprotector. I am not incapable of defending myself, but I am far more\ndangerous if I don’t have to worry about physical danger.\n“So go back with the lancers,” Styke said, getting frustrated.\nI haven’t anointed the lancers. I have anointed you. Besides, Taniel has\ntrusted you with me. Neither of us wants to betray that trust.\nStyke noted the fond way she smiled when she signed Taniel’s name. He\nspat in the dust. “What the pit do you mean by ‘anointing’? Have you done\nany of that blood magic shit on me?” He thought of that moment in the\ntown outside of Landfall just before the invasion.\nKa-poel regarded him coolly, but did not answer. This was not, Styke\ndecided, the place to press the point. He didn’t want to take her to task in\npublic, and he definitely didn’t want his men to witness him being\nstonewalled by a hundred-pound Palo woman. Besides, if she had put some\nkind of her magic on him, he would have smelled it. Wouldn’t he have?\n“We’ll talk about this again. I have a man to kill. Are you two coming?”\nHe climbed into Amrec’s saddle and lifted Celine up after him.\n“Are you going to let me watch you kill him?” Celine asked as they\nbegan to ride.\nStyke sucked on his teeth. He shouldn’t. He should turn around and\nleave Celine with Ibana. Better yet, he should hand her over to Ka-poel and\ntell them both to get lost. But he had the feeling that wouldn’t actually\nwork. Besides, he also had the feeling that he shouldn’t tell a child about his\nplans to kill a man in the first place but that ship had sailed. “Just stay out\nof the way when the fighting starts.”\nStyke followed a stranger’s directions across the city, eventually\nreaching a warehouse on the main thoroughfare just outside the old city\nwalls on the north end of town. The warehouse’s main door had been\nreplaced by a colonnaded facade in imitation of the boxing arenas in\nLandfall, above which was an enormous banner bearing a likeness of\nValyaine’s upper body, fists held forward for a fight. The building had not\nbeen damaged by the shelling, the streets outside crowded with wounded\nand displaced citizens.\nStyke left Celine with Amrec and entered through the front door.

It could easily fit five\nthousand people, and from the busts and posters around the building, Styke\ngathered that there were shows every night. Valyaine himself, one of the\nposters proclaimed, was a feature every weekend.\nThe arena wasn’t empty; it had been converted into a hospital for the\nvictims of the shelling. Quiet moans filled the hall, coming from the\ncountless wounded laid out on every surface. Surgeons and nurses rushed\naround, and Styke even spotted a woman in Privileged’s gloves attending to\nthe worst of the battered, filling the room with the brimstone smell of her\nsorcery. He breathed it in, enjoying the biting scent.\nStyke almost backed out. He didn’t need to fight in a hospital. But\nValyaine was here somewhere. Styke could feel his blood begin to rise in\nanticipation of violence, and he caught the arm of a passing nurse. “I’m\nlooking for Valyaine Soris,” he said.\nThe woman looked him up and down, her eyes widening at his size. “I\ndon’t know where he is,” she said. “But I’m in a hurry. I last saw him a few\nhours ago.” She rushed off before he could question her further, leaving him\nempty-handed.\nHe plucked at his big lancers’ ring, running his thumb over the skull\nrelief and looking around the hall. Maybe, he thought, it would be best to\ncome kill Valyaine on his way back through Bellport.\n“Styke?”\nStyke turned around to find Valyaine standing in the doorway, a load of\nfresh linen in his arms and a surprised look on his face. The surprise\ndisappeared quickly, leaving behind something akin to resignation.\n“Soris,” Styke said, nodding slowly. He examined Valyaine in a\nheartbeat, taking in all the changes. Valyaine wasn’t a tall man, easily a foot\nand a half shorter than Styke, but he’d always been well muscled. In the last\nten years he’d grown positively enormous, with arms bigger around than\nStyke’s and a chest that looked like it could catch a cannonball without\nsplitting. He had a square jaw and short, jet-black hair, and he wore a\nbusinessman’s suit and trousers. “This your place?” Styke asked, gesturing\nbehind him.\n“It is.” Valyaine passed by Styke warily, handing the linens off to a\nnurse. He looked Styke up and down like a butcher prepping a piece of a\nmeat, his eyes lingering on Styke’s knife. “Heard you were still alive. Heard\nyou saved Landfall.”\n“Something like that,” Styke replied. He began to move slowly, keeping\nValyaine in his field of vision, and they began to circle each other in the\nvestibule of the arena. “I heard you did a favor for Fidelis Jes a decade ago\nto buy you this.” He gestured around the arena.\nValyaine took off his jacket and lay it on a nearby bench, never once\ntaking his eyes off Styke. “Me? I got paid, sure. But I built all this myself.”\n“How much did he pay you?”"

Didn’t see\nthe need. I’m not the greedy shit Agoston is.”\n“Was,” Styke corrected.\n“Right. You do him with that big knife of yours?”\n“I did.” Styke tapped the underside of his jaw. “Put it through the soft\nspot here.”\n“You came across central Fatrasta. I imagine Tenny is dead, too?”\n“Very,” Styke lied.\nValyaine sighed. He didn’t seem frightened or even all that put out. Just\ntired. “Dvory?”\n“He’s next.”\n“He’s got a field army at his back, so best of luck with that.” Valyaine’s\neyes fell to Styke’s knife. “You gonna take it personally when I fight back?”\nStyke almost laughed. That indignant anger now churned in his belly,\nbut more than that, he felt alive, as alive as when he unleashed Amrec to a\nfull gallop toward an enemy flank. “Traitor or not, I wouldn’t begrudge a\nman a good fight.”\n“You wait here while I go get myself a knife?”\nStyke snorted. Despite Valyaine’s resignation, there was a light in his\neyes. He, too, was looking forward to this. Styke made two fists. He didn’t\nwant this to go down like it did with Agoston. He wanted this to last. “We’ll\ndo this your way.”\n“Suit yourself.” Valyaine rolled up the sleeves of his white dress shirt\nand flexed his fingers. They continued to circle.\n“I always liked you, Valyaine.”\n“Yeah? Well, I always thought you were a wanker.” Valyaine darted\nforward faster than Styke expected, his arms coming up in a boxer’s stance\nand his right fist lashing out and connecting with Styke’s chin in a powerful\njab that snapped Styke’s head back and brought tears to his eyes. Styke\nstumbled, raising his arms in defense, taking two more jabs to the ribs\nbefore he could fend off the attack.\nValyaine retreated, bouncing on the balls of his feet, fists held high.\nStyke copied the stance, remembering his days fighting in the barracks, well\nbefore the Mad Lancers. He swung at Valyaine’s head, but the punch was\ntoo slow. Valyaine ducked beneath it, hammering his left side with a flurry\nof blows, causing Styke to double over—only to take a knee to his\nforehead.\nStyke fell back against the wall. His eyes were blurry, blood leaking\nfrom his nose and mouth and streaming from Valyaine’s knuckles.\n“What are you doing, Ben?” Valyaine asked, dancing in front of Styke,\nfeinting left and right. “Is this part of some path of vengeance?

Rumor\nhas it you’ve threatened to crucify any soldiers you find stealing from\nFatrastans. Is that true?”\nIt wasn’t, but Styke didn’t see the need to correct him. It sounded like\nsomething he’d do.\nWhen he didn’t answer, Valyaine barked a laugh. “That’s some\nhypocritical shit there, Ben.”\n“We never stole from the people we protected,” Styke snapped. He\npushed himself off the wall and brought his arms in. He closed the distance\nbetween them, attacking Valyaine with short jabs that the boxer simply\nslapped aside. Only one managed to land, hitting Valyaine in the cheek and\nsending him reeling.\nValyaine recovered and spat blood at Styke. “We stole from everyone,”\nhe growled. “You’ve got rose-colored spectacles, you big dumb asshole. If\nwe needed something, we’d just accuse someone of being a royalist and\ntake it from them. Maybe there was a veneer of honor to it, but never more\nthan skin-deep.”\nThe whole hall had grown silent, and Styke could feel the eyes of the\ndoctors and nurses and wounded upon them as they continued to circle. He\nthought about his vengeance, and realized that to all these people he was\njust a big dumb soldier attacking their benefactor.\nThe vengeance was only in his head. But then again, that’s all that ever\nmattered.\nValyaine came at him again, smashing fists against Styke’s arms,\njabbing his ribs. Styke swung hard and low, ignoring a blow to his face in\norder to land his own. He felt something crack beneath his knuckles, and\nValyaine suddenly retreated again, holding his side.\nValyaine grinned. “Pit, I forgot how strong you are.” He spat out more\nblood. “You know, Ben, it’s been so long I forget what it was that Fidelis\nJes said that made me decide to betray you. He prodded at all of us, you\nknow—for over a year. He even tried to get to Ibana. Didn’t anyone warn\nyou?” He shook his head. “Nah, of course not. You don’t warn Ben Styke.\nThat’s like warning a hurricane. What good would it do?”\nStyke wished Valyaine would shut up and focus on the fight. This wasn’t\nhow it was supposed to go. This wasn’t meant to be fun—not for him, and\ndefinitely not for Valyaine. This was just a man taking care of business. He\nswung with his left fist, letting Valyaine duck under it, following up with\nhis right and grabbing Valyaine by the neck, lifting him and slamming him\nagainst the wall. Styke felt a kick against his knee and suddenly lost his\nbalance. He gasped in pain as he fell, then felt Valyaine’s fist slam into the\nside of his temple with the force of a warhorse kick.\nStyke staggered to the side, seeing double, and turned back toward\nValyaine."

Some hypothetical image?”\n“Hypothetical? Pit, Ben! What kind of shit did you smoke in the labor\ncamps? I was there. I saw the terror that was the Mad Lancers. We were a\ngoddamned force of nature. Cutting off the head was the only way to stop\nus.” Valyaine shook his head. “I wish it didn’t come to that. I wish we’d all\njust gone home, but instead we had to leave with the worst kinds of scars.”\nHe tapped the side of his head. “Agoston spent all his money to climb into\nthe bottom of a bottle for the last decade. Tenny Wiles got himself a wife\nand buried his head between her legs. Worst of all, Dvory got put in charge\nof a whole field army as his reward from Jes. Between you and me, he\nnever did care. I may dislike you, but Dvory … he hates you.”\nStyke’s vision finally began to clear. “And you?”\n“Me? It bothered me for a year or two. Then I forgot about it. Got a\ncareer. Made money. Started to help people in the community. I sate my\nbloodlust in the ring and I’ve only killed a few men doing it. Sometimes I\ngo on a mala binge. Helps me forget about the things we did in the name of\nfreedom.”\nStyke could see Valyaine settle his weight on his back foot, coiling like a\nsnake ready to spring. He fell back a half step and when Valyaine leapt\nforward, he was ready. He caught the wrist of Valyaine’s right arm and\njerked him past, grabbing his neck and using Valyaine’s own momentum to\nlift him clear off the ground. He spun, flinging Valyaine with all his strength\nthrough the arena doors.\nThe doors burst open, one of them snapping off the hinges as Valyaine\nstumbled through them and into the street, reeling until he finally collapsed\nin the mud.\nStyke followed him out, removing his knife from his belt. To his\nsurprise, Valyaine wasn’t even unconscious. He lay in a puddle with about\nas much grace as a man could, looking back up at Styke through hazy eyes\nand laughing quietly to himself.\n“What’s so funny?” Styke asked.\n“You,” Valyaine said. “I always told Dvory that you would never die. He\ninsisted you were already gone, that Jes had put you in front of a firing\nsquad and a doctor pronounced you dead.”\n“And that’s funny?”"

He eyed Styke’s\nknife. “What’s really funny is that you don’t even know what you actually\nare. You always demand the closest loyalty from your own men, but you\nnever give your own.”\n“I’ve always protected Fatrasta,” Styke protested. He wondered why he\nbothered—he needed to step over and finish this with a swing of his knife.\n“Bah,” Valyaine spat. “A concept. You’ve never been loyal to a person.\nYou’ve never listened to a set of orders without thinking about how you\nwere going to disobey them. You’ve never been Commander Ben Styke, the\nofficer that everyone else can depend on. You’ve just been that force of\nnature. They pointed you at the people they wanted dead and hoped you\ndidn’t come around and get them all killed.” Valyaine looked at the knife in\nBen’s hand and raised his fists. “Let’s finish it, big man.”\nStyke stared at Valyaine. He stared hard, letting the words rattle around\ninside his mind. He needed to kill Valyaine, to finish this whole thing off.\nHe stepped forward, setting his foot for good purchase in the mud and took\na swing.\nEven as he went through the motion, he knew it was half-hearted.\nValyaine knew it too. He stepped into the swing, catching Styke’s weak\nwrist with a quick jab that made his hand go numb. His knife fell from his\nhands. Valyaine’s next punch came all the way across the boxer’s body and\nslammed into Styke’s chest with immense power. Styke stumbled back,\nslipped in the mud, and fell.\nHe struggled to breathe, looking up at Valyaine. Slowly, Valyaine\nlowered his fists. He took one step to the side, picking Styke’s knife out of\nthe mud, then tossing it to him hilt-first. “I never wanted you dead, Ben. I\njust wanted things to end. You think about that real hard. Go slaughter\nDynize until you swim in blood. If you still want more, you can come back\nhere and gut me. I’ll even open my shirt for you.”\nValyaine turned around and walked back into the arena.\nStyke struggled to his feet. He’d killed men before for walking away\nduring a fight. He watched until Valyaine had disappeared, then limped\nacross the street to where Ka-poel and Celine waited with Amrec. Passersby\nstared. He ignored them.\nCeline had a strange look on her face, Ka-poel a scowl. Styke took the\nreins from Celine and realized that she’d probably never heard anyone talk\nlike that to him—like an equal who was sick of his shit. She asked in a quiet\nvoice, “Why didn’t you kill him?”\nIt was an echo of the question she’d asked when he failed to kill Tenny\nWiles.

Because he beat me fair and square almost came to his lips, but\ninstead he said, “Because he wasn’t wrong,” and limped down the street\nwith Amrec in tow.\nEverything hurt—he hadn’t been beaten that hard since the labor camp,\nand it wasn’t a good kind of memory. He felt around with his tongue,\nmaking sure he had all his teeth, and gingerly touched his face. Broken\nnose. Split lips. Maybe a cracked rib. He still had a hard time breathing.\nHe’d need a big supply of horngum before he left town.\nThey’d gone a few blocks when Styke suddenly spotted something out\nof the corner of his eye. He handed the reins to Celine, who still sat alone\non Amrec’s saddle, and limped down the street toward an old man he’d\nspotted leading a horse.\n“You there,” he said, tapping the man on the shoulder.\n“Eh?” The old man turned, looked up at Styke, and did a double take.\n“What do you want?”\nStyke did a quick circuit of the horse, looking at teeth, eyes, hooves, and\nlegs while the man looked on, bewildered. “It looks like a midget Rosvelan\ndraft horse,” Styke said.\n“Not bred that way. She’s just a runt. Can I help you with something?”\n“How does she do with noise?”\n“What’s this about?” the man demanded.\n“Noise?” Styke said. “How does she do with it? Quick movements, large\ncrowds, all that?”\n“She does great,” the man retorted. “She’s a damned miniature\nwarhorse, just too small for a soldier. What the pit do you want?”\nStyke ignored the man’s frustration. “Name me a price and I’ll buy her\nright now.”\nThe man looked around suspiciously before eyeing Styke for a long\nmoment. “A thousand krana.”\nIt was three hundred more than the horse was worth. “Done,” Styke\nreplied. “You bring her and any kit you have for her out to the Mad Lancer\ncamp by nightfall. Tell Ibana ja Fles that Ben Styke bought a horse for the\ngirl, and she’ll pay you.”\n“I … I …”\nStyke left the man standing there stuttering and returned to Ka-poel and\nCeline. Ka-poel had a small smile on her face, and Styke avoided looking\nher in the eye.\n“Who was that?” Celine asked.\n“Just some man,” Styke replied.\n“What did you want with him?”\nStyke took Amrec’s reins, patting Celine gently on the arm. “I wanted to\nbuy his horse. She’s yours. Should be there by the time we go to bed\ntonight.”\nThe look of joy on Celine’s face made him forget all about his broken\nnose, Valyaine, and the entire damned war. Unable to stop grinning, Styke\nled them back to the Mad Lancer camp.\nCHAPTER 33\nV\nlora caught sight of Prime Lektor again three days after speaking with\nTaniel in the Yellow Creek jail.\nFinding him was purely luck.

        "text": "CHAPTER 33\nV\nlora caught sight of Prime Lektor again three days after speaking with\nTaniel in the Yellow Creek jail.\nFinding him was purely luck. Vlora was returning from another fruitless\nmorning of searching the nooks and crannies of the mountains surrounding\nYellow Creek. The newsies on her normal route had sold out of their papers\nalready, so she went out of her way to find a street corner where the boys\nstill had some stock. She had just found a paper and folded it over to read\nwhile she walked when her gaze swept across the familiar profile.\nPrime sat outside a café in the one small area of town that could be\nconsidered posh—if one squinted a little. It was midday, and he was\nenjoying a coffee, biscuits, and a newspaper while he faced away from the\nsun.\nVlora forced herself to act casual, turning slowly to cut across traffic and\nheading around to a nearby storefront where she could get a good look at\nhis face without crossing his line of sight. Once she could clearly see the\ninkvine birthmark that cut across the left side of his face, she knew he was\ndefinitely Prime Lektor.\nVlora waffled. A part of her wanted to walk over, pull up a seat, and ask\nPrime straight out why he was here. It was a foolish thought, one that she\nhad no problem talking herself out of, and instead she circled around behind\nhim and took a seat on a nearby stoop where she could keep an eye on him\nover her newspaper.\nShe only half read the articles as she watched the back of Prime’s head.\nThe news was all two weeks old, and was filled with rampant speculation\nregarding the war, Dynize military might, rumors of Lindet’s assassination,\nand more. Nothing looked reliable and it frustrated her to no end, so she\nturned her attention purely on Prime.\nOne of the odd quirks of sorcery was that a powder mage could sense a\nPrivileged, but a Privileged could not sense a powder mage. Vlora did not\nknow if the same rule applied to the Predeii, but considering that Prime\ndidn’t just turn around and incinerate her, she assumed that it did.\nThe immediate problem was that, while she definitely recognized Prime\nLektor, she could not sense his sorcerous presence. He was cloaking himself\nfrom any such scrying. It would make him difficult to follow or predict.\nShe tried to think of any possible reason for his presence in Yellow\nCreek—aside from the godstone. Nothing came to mind, and that left her\nwith a number of pressing questions. What were his intentions regarding the\nstone? Had he already found it? Was he alert and ready in case he was\nfound, or was he complacent in his power? There were no easy answers,\nwhich meant Vlora would have to find them the hard way, the dangerous\nway.\nIt was about thirty minutes before Prime folded his paper, finished off\nhis coffee, and stood up. He was dressed as a frontier gentleman, with a tan\ncotton suit and matching top hat, a cane, and a pair of spectacles perched on\nthe front of his nose. He surreptitiously took a look around before tucking\nthe paper under one arm and heading down the street.\nVlora followed at a distance."

He surreptitiously took a look around before tucking\nthe paper under one arm and heading down the street.\nVlora followed at a distance.\nShe didn’t have to go far. Prime took a right at the next intersection and\nwalked up to the front door of what passed for a townhouse in a frontier\ncity. The building was a narrow two stories, a mix of wood and plaster\nconstruction with a sharply slanted roof and cheerful bright green shutters.\nPrime let himself in, leaving Vlora lurking at the corner and completely\nuncertain about what to do next.\nShe carefully cast her senses toward the townhouse, feeling around with\na light, tentative touch for wards. There were all sorts of passive things a\nPrivileged could do to protect a location. Doorknobs could be warded to\nstun or kill anyone who touched them, floors could inform the Privileged\nwhen someone had walked upon them, and whole buildings could be\nprepped to explode when entered. Wards were also, as far as Vlora was\naware, next to impossible to hide completely.\nField Marshal Tamas had been an expert at detecting wards. He’d even\ntaught Vlora how to pick a ward apart—something that most Privileged still\nconsidered impossible for a powder mage—but Vlora had never really\ncaught on to the latter ability. The former, however, she’d grown quite good\nat.\nYet she sensed nothing, even when she poked around for the telltale\nsigns of a ward that had been folded in on itself to hide it.\nShe was just beginning to wonder if she’d gone mad when the front door\nto the townhouse opened. She took a half step back, trying to look\ninconspicuous. Prime didn’t even look up, staring at the front of his folded\nnewspaper with a scowl as he walked briskly past her. She waited a few\nmoments, then turned to follow him.\nHad he already noticed her and was leading her into a trap? She tried to\nremember every detail about him. He was an academic, supporting Tamas\nduring the Adran coup, and had apparently masqueraded as a succession of\nvice chancellors of Adopest University for hundreds of years. He might\ngenuinely be absentminded, content that his power kept him hidden.\nVlora was deep in thought when she looked up to find that she was no\nlonger following Prime. Her heart quickened and she doubled her pace,\nhurrying to the next intersection. She checked doorways and alleys for fifty\nyards. She even looked back down the street to see if he’d doubled back.\nNo such luck. He had disappeared entirely.\nVlora swore under her breath. This asshole could disappear, both in this\nworld and in the Else. She couldn’t see him; she couldn’t sense him. He\ncould be standing right behind her and she wouldn’t notice it.\nShe doubled back around the block several times just in case she had\nmissed him. After waiting for nearly ten minutes for him to reappear, she\nheaded to his townhouse, where she walked up to the front door, took a hit\nof powder, and closed her eyes. In a deep powder trance she could hear\nfootsteps, heavy breathing, sometimes even a heartbeat. She tried to focus\non the house, ignoring the ambient sound of the street.\nNothing."

She tried to focus\non the house, ignoring the ambient sound of the street.\nNothing.\nSearching his residence might turn up clues to the godstone’s location.\nBut if she hadn’t been able to sense him disappear, that meant that he could\ncreate wards that she couldn’t sense, either. Walking straight into his house\nmight get her killed.\nShe waffled on the front step for a moment before noticing an old\nwoman sweeping the steps of the next house over. The woman glanced up,\nnoticed that Vlora was watching her, and leaned heavily on her broom.\n“What you selling?” she demanded.\nThe question caught Vlora off guard. “Excuse me?”\n“The gentleman who owns that house doesn’t like to be bothered. If\nyou’re selling something, you can tell me and I’ll let him know when he’s\nnext in.”\n“Does he often buy things?”\n“Never. But he likes to know who’s knocking on his door. So you can\neither leave me your card or bugger off.”\nVlora hesitated, trying to concoct some sort of story that wouldn’t make\nPrime suspicious. Coming up with nothing, she tipped her hat to the old\nwoman and made her retreat, heading down the street without a backward\nglance and frustrated that she’d not learned anything new about Prime.\nShe corrected herself on that last thought. She had learned two things:\none, that Prime could disappear at will, and two, that Prime paid his\nneighbors to watch the house for him while he was out. If he was worried\nabout being tracked down, it meant he was hiding something, and she was\nwilling to bet it wasn’t just his own sorcerous nature.\nCHAPTER 34\nT\nhe Mad Lancers left Bellport, heading west along the northern coast of\nthe Hammer. They traveled slowly, sending out as many scouts as they\ndared and avoiding the larger towns and cities already flying the Dynize\nflag. They even stayed several miles inland to avoid being spotted by\nDynize ships—of which, their scouts informed them, there were dozens\nplying the waters back and forth between Fatrasta and Dynize.\nStyke kept to himself for several days, content to ride with the rear\nguard while recovering from the beating Valyaine gave him and teaching\nCeline how to handle her new horse. The creature turned out to be more\nstubborn than Styke had initially guessed, and would have found itself\ndiscarded with the rest of the extra horses had Celine not taken an equally\nstubborn liking to it.\nFrequent reports came from Ibana with the vanguard. Styke read the\nreports and sent orders to the front. During the evenings he helped train the\nnewest recruits—having picked up almost five hundred volunteers in\nBellport—while Celine continued to learn Ka-poel’s language.\nOn the fourth day of riding, Styke heard the distant report of artillery\nand made his way up the winding line of cavalry, joining Ibana with the\nvanguard over a mile ahead. She sat on her horse on a cliff top, eyes\nfocused on something in the distance.

Jackal, bearing the Mad Lancer\nstandard, sat with her.\nTo the northwest, Styke was able to see the source of the cannon fire that\ncontinued to echo across the water. There was a small fortress, whose name\nhad long since escaped him, positioned at the end of a long breakwater. It\noverlooked the space between the Hammer and an unnamed island, and it\nwas exchanging a violent torrent of fire with a sizable Dynize fleet\npositioned in a half-moon around the fortress.\n“I’m guessing,” Ibana said without lowering her looking glass, “that\nyou’ve been skulking with the rear guard the last few days because you\nfailed to kill Valyaine?”\nStyke glanced around. The only people within earshot were Jackal,\nCeline, and Ka-poel. Styke looked to Jackal, whose Palo freckles had\ndarkened with all the time out in the sun. Jackal simply lifted his hands.\nThis was not something he wanted to get involved with.\n“I’ve been teaching Celine to ride her new horse.”\nIbana snapped her looking glass closed and turned toward Styke. “I\nheard you let Valyaine beat the shit out of you.”\n“ ‘Let’ seems a strong word. He’s a champion boxer.”\n“And you have the biggest knife on the continent,” Ibana retorted. “Why\nthe pit did you square up fisticuffs against a champion boxer?”\n“I wanted to see if I could kill him with my fists.”\n“It didn’t work out. He betrayed you, and he’s still alive.”\n“I can always go back and gut him later,” Styke said, the words coming\nout a little more petulant than he’d intended.\nIbana fixed Styke with a long stare and then turned to Celine. “What’s\nher name, sweetheart?” she asked gently, indicating Celine’s horse.\nCeline beamed. “Margo. She already had the name and I liked it, so I\ndecided to let her keep it.”\n“That’s a good name,” Ibana replied. She nudged her own horse, quickly\ntrotting around Margo before nodding. “Looks like a good horse.”\n“Ben bought her for me.” There was an edge of challenge in Celine’s\nvoice, as if daring Ibana to question the man who would acquire a horse for\na little girl. Styke almost laughed out loud.\nHe butted in before Ibana could get annoyed. “I haven’t been hiding,” he\nsaid.\n“Good,” Ibana said simply. She drew closer to Styke, letting her voice\nfall. She didn’t look happy with what she was about to say, but she\ncontinued on. “You know it just as well as I do—the Mad Lancers ride on\ntheir reputation. On your reputation. You start sparing people who have\nbetrayed you and people will think you’ve gone soft. The prospect of your\nknife is the only thing that keeps some of these bastards in line.”\nStyke sat back in his saddle, unsure how to respond. He remembered\nAgoston’s blood running down his arms, and then sparing Tenny Wiles.\n“They start to get uppity and I’ll set them straight.”\n“It’s never come to that before. I don’t want it to come to that.”\nStyke snorted. “Let me handle my vengeance the way I see fit.”"

It’s just … a word of warning, that’s all.”\n“Thank you,” Styke replied.\nIbana nodded and rode off a few dozen yards, pulling out her looking\nglass to watch the distant bombardment. Styke turned to Jackal. “How has\nthe ride been?”\n“Easy enough,” Jackal said. “Scouts are keeping us clear of Dynize\nforces. How is the rear guard?”\n“Boring,” Styke replied. He nodded to the distant fortress. “Do the\nspirits tell you how much longer that fortress will last?”\nJackal’s eyes immediately went over Styke’s shoulder, and it took him a\nmoment to realize Jackal was looking directly at Ka-poel. “Are you\nkidding? Only the bravest spirits will come within a mile of her. I can\nalways tell when she’s getting near because they flee before she arrives.”\n“You hear that, blood-lady?” Styke called. “The spirits are afraid of\nyou.”\nKa-poel seemed entirely unimpressed.\n“But it doesn’t take the spirits,” Jackal said, returning his gaze to the\ndistant fort, “to see they’re almost done for. There’s six ships of the line out\nthere and two brigades cutting off any support from the mainland. The\nfortress will fall within days.” He gave Styke a curious look. “Are we going\nto relieve them?”\nStyke glanced at Ka-poel. “Is the godstone in that fort?”\nShe shook her head.\n“No,” he told Jackal. “I’m not suicidal enough to charge two brigades in\nclear view of a supporting enemy fleet.” Besides, he added to himself,\nthey’d already resupplied at Bellport. “We’ll have to swing around those\ntwo brigades. With luck, they’ll be so focused on the fort that they don’t\neven notice us.”\nStyke heard a sudden shout from down the road. He turned, curious, and\nwas soon joined by Ibana. “What was that?” she asked.\n“I’m not sure.” Styke lifted Amrec’s reins, spotting a dust cloud rising\nfrom a nearby hill, and a familiar old face suddenly burst into view.\nSunintiel clung to her horse’s neck, both she and her animal streaming tears\nfrom the hard ride, her wrinkled skin covered in a sheen of sweat. She stood\nin the stirrups, not bothering to slow.\n“We’ve been ambushed!” she shouted. “Dynize cavalry from the rear!”\nStyke whipped Amrec into a gallop. “Stay with Celine,” he ordered\nSunin. He pointed a finger behind him as he charged past. “And keep Ka-\npoel out of the fight!”\nHe and Ibana raced along the road, past the milling of confused\ncavalrymen. Styke came around the hill into the valley that contained the\nbulk of his forces, taking in the situation at a glance. Dynize dragoons had\nswept in from the southern end of the valley, crossing a small creek and\nopening fire with carbines on the Mad Lancers, who were still strung out\nalong the road.\nThere were at least three thousand dragoons, with more coming over the"

The lancers were in chaos—those that tried to fire\nback couldn’t pack a big enough punch, and the few that charged were\ndeftly avoided and gunned down.\nAnother wave of dragoons suddenly appeared at the other end of the\nvalley, blocking a retreat along the road and engaging the rear guard with a\nwithering fusillade.\nStyke pressed Amrec harder, weaving among his confused troops.\n“Ibana!” he shouted. “Take the vanguard and swing around to their flank.\nThey’re not wearing breastplates. Hit the bastards with our lances!”\nHe continued on without waiting for an answer, galloping toward the\nrear guard and the fresh recruits being cut to ribbons. He passed Major\nGustar, who’d just barely organized the Riflejack cavalry core enough to\nreturn fire. “Press them hard,” Styke shouted, slowing just enough to get his\norders out. “That hill they came down was easier for them to descend than it\nwill be to go back up. Send your cuirassiers straight at their center!”\nStyke was quickly past. He urged Amrec harder, watching as more of his\ncavalry fell to the enemy carbine volleys. The Dynize became bolder,\npressing in on the rear guard, not bothering to retreat before they reloaded\ntheir weapons. Styke finally reached the rear guard, who were desperately\ntrying to reload their own carbines.\n“Blast the carbines!” Styke roared as he whipped past them. “Lances\ndown! Charge!” He snatched up his lance, lowering the steel tip as he broke\nthrough the confused line of his own men and up the open road toward the\nDynize.\nDragoons had come within ten yards and they seemed shocked to see\nhim charging toward them wearing one of their own breastplates. A bullet\nwhizzed past Styke’s ear and he felt another slam into the breastplate,\njerking him back in the saddle. He kept his hold on the reins and on his\nlance, leaning forward.\nThe closest Dynize fumbled with his carbine, dropped it, then tried to\nurge his horse to run in the opposite direction. Styke’s lance clipped him in\nthe side, tearing out four inches of flesh and several feet of intestine and\nburying it into the next dragoon. Letting go of his weighty lance, Styke\ndrew his cavalry sword and urged Amrec forward, laying about him with\nhis weapon.\nGore whipped from the rise and fall of his sword. Blood spattered his\nlips, but Styke didn’t bother to check if it was his own or the enemy’s. Their\nsudden onslaught turned to confusion at his charge, and still he pushed\ndeeper, using Amrec’s mighty chest to shove past the smaller Dynize\nhorses.\nOnly upon turning to block the sword thrust of an enemy did Styke see\nthat the new recruits had not, actually, followed him into the fray.

It wasn’t\nuntil Jackal appeared, waving the skull-and-lance flag and charging\nforward, that they seemed to break out of their shock and attack.\nA straight-bladed dragoon sword caught in the clasp of Styke’s\nbreastplate. He sheared off the arm holding it and discarded the blade, but\nthe clasp snapped at the next impact of an enemy bullet. With one quick\nmovement, Styke bit down on Amrec’s reins and used his left hand to pry\nthe other clasp off the broken breastplate. He swung it over his head and\nthrew it at a charging dragoon, knocking the rider off his horse. Reins still\nbetween his teeth, he drew his boz knife and rammed it into the chest of a\nman whose mount had been pushed too close in the melee. He jerked it out\nand threw it overhand into the neck of a horse. The horse screamed,\nthrowing its rider.\nStyke finally fought his way to the top of the ridge, looking down at the\nroad. It was covered with the bodies of men and horses—almost all of them\nbelonging to the new recruits from Bellport, stragglers who’d fallen behind\nthe rear guard. With a glance Styke could see how the dragoons had come\nout of the trees, catching them completely unawares and slaughtering them\nwithout a fight.\nThe glance also told him that he’d reached the very edge of this wave of\ndragoons—they had no more men attacking the rear guard. He whirled to\nrally the rear, to dispose of these dragoons and join Gustar and Ibana to\nfight their main force.\nSomething struck his shoulder just as he drew breath to bellow\nencouragement. He turned to see a dragoon charging him at full speed,\nsmoking carbine being exchanged for a straight-edged sword. The rider\ndidn’t have time to fully draw her sword before her horse struck Amrec in\nthe shoulder, sending both Amrec and Styke tumbling.\nStyke barely managed to throw himself clear. Amrec fell on his side,\nlegs flailing, finally righting himself and charging off before Styke could\ncall to him.\nThe Dynize dragoon allowed her own horse to regain its balance before\nturning on a dime and pointing her sword at Styke and digging in her heels.\nStyke searched for his sword only to see it caught in Amrec’s harness as the\nbeast galloped away. He felt for his knife—remembered throwing it—and\nbegan to loudly swear at himself.\nThe dragoon leapt into a gallop, her sword held to her side as she\nswooped in toward Styke. He remained on her sword side for as long as he\ndared, then leapt in front of the charging horse and across to the opposite\nside. Before the dragoon could change her sword hand, Styke set the foot of\nhis good leg and barreled, shoulder-first, into the soft side of the Dynize\nhorse.

He barely stayed on his feet and ran toward the horse that, still flailing\nwith pain, had his boz knife in its neck. He jerked the knife out, reversed his\nhold on it, and rammed the blade into the creature’s spine with one quick\nmotion, putting it out of its misery.\nA shout of challenge was the only warning he got. The persistent\ndragoon leapt toward him, sword thrusting, and Styke barely parried the\nthrust with the blade of his knife. He charged forward, closing the distance,\nramming his left fist into the dragoon’s face.\nShe reeled back but did not fall, driving him off with blind swipes of her\nsword.\nThey both froze, staring at each other, giving Styke his first good look at\nhis opponent. She was tall—not as tall as he or Ibana, but nearly so—and\nshe had wide shoulders that reminded him of Valyaine. She was broad-faced\nwith quick eyes and her red hair shorn to a finger’s length. Her teal uniform\nhad orange epaulets, which, Styke assumed, meant she was an officer. Over\nhis shoulder he could hear Jackal urging the rear guard to finish off their\nDynize attackers.\nThe dragoon regarded him for another long moment, her eyes flicking to\nher fallen cavalry, before suddenly turning and sprinting toward the closest\nempty saddle. She pulled herself onto horseback with incredible dexterity\nand was galloping back toward the edge of the forest before Styke could\ntake a dozen steps.\nHe turned at the sound of a trumpet, watching as the Dynize cavalry\ndisengaged from the Mad Lancers and began to retreat. The lancers, for\ntheir part, were obviously badly mauled, and he was not surprised when\nIbana did not give the order to follow.\nHe found the dragoon officer’s horse where he’d shoved it over. The\npoor creature thrashed in pain with one leg broken and probably several\ncracked ribs. Styke calmed it as best he could and covered its eyes with one\narm before putting it out of its misery.\nHe found Amrec and went back up the road in search of Ibana.\n“That was a timely charge,” he told Jackal as he passed.\nJackal waved back at him. “The spirits wouldn’t forgive me if I allowed\nyou to die charging an enemy army alone.”\nStyke found Ibana down in the valley taking stock of their—and the\nenemy’s—losses. She was on foot, kneeling over a half-dead Dynize\ndragoon, trying to get the man to talk through a mouthful of blood. She left\nhim be, snorting in disgust, then turned to face Styke.\n“Find out where these bastards came from?” Styke asked.\nIbana shook her head. “He’s not talking, nor is anyone still alive. We’ll\ntake a few captives and work on them later. Maybe give them to Ka-poel\nand see what she can learn.”\n“Maybe,” Styke said. He wasn’t thrilled with the idea of handing anyone\nover to Ka-poel. He wasn’t entirely sure what she could do or how she\ncould do it, but it sounded … protracted. He did not like torture. “That"

They weren’t willing to commit everything to the\nfight, it seems.”\nIbana kicked at a body at her feet. “Damn it. We’ve sent scouts in every\ndirection. How the pit did they sneak up on us like that?”\n“Send a few men to follow them,” Styke said. “Not too closely, but …”\nHe glanced back toward the road, then in the direction they had retreated.\n“They came from the south, but they retreated to the west. Send a few men\nthe way they came, too.”\n“Right.” Ibana stalked off, barking orders, while Styke stared down at\nthe poor bastard she’d been interrogating. One of his arms was hanging by\nskin and he had three stab wounds through his chest. He’d be dead soon\nenough.\nHe glanced up to the ridge, where well over a hundred of the new\nrecruits lay dead or dying. He wondered about that Dynize officer. This\nambush had felt strange. It had felt … personal. Were those blasted\ndragonmen behind it? Or was this something else?\nCHAPTER 35\nM\nichel was shaken awake by his own violent shivers. He lay on his back,\nstaring up at blackness, a vague discomfort emanating from somewhere\naround the middle of his body. His first realization was that his entire body\nwas trembling uncontrollably. No amount of effort could cease the shaking.\nHis second realization was that he could not move. There was not, as far\nas he could tell, anything keeping him from moving—nothing across his\nchest or binding his arms. His body simply did not respond to the\ncommands. He could breathe. He could shiver. He could open his eyes and\nmove his head slightly from one side to the other, though he did not know if\nhis vision was dark or if he was merely in a dark room. Only a well of\ncalmness from deep within—one he did not know he possessed—kept him\nfrom spiraling into outright terror.\nHe lay still for several minutes, attempting to get his bearings and gain\ncontrol of his shivering body. He was unsuccessful in the first, and only\nmildly successful in the second. The problem, he realized, was that he was\nlying on something extremely cold. Cold and hard.\nHe cleared his throat, wondering if he could speak, and heard someone\n—or something—stir in what sounded like a different room. Footsteps\nfollowed, then Michel could feel a presence just out of his peripheral vision.\nAlthough he was fairly certain he knew the answer, he spoke anyway: “Am\nI dead?”\n“You are not.”\nMichel let out a very soft sigh. The voice belonged to Emerald, which\nmeant that Michel was likely lying on a slab in the bowels of the Landfall\nCity Morgue. It explained the cold, as well as the darkness. It wasn’t his\nfirst choice of a place to wake up to, but it certainly wasn’t his last.\nAs if in answer to his thoughts, the dim light suddenly grew brighter,\nilluminating the stone ceiling that Michel had been staring at. “How do you\nfeel?” Emerald said, sitting down beside him."

        "text": "As if in answer to his thoughts, the dim light suddenly grew brighter,\nilluminating the stone ceiling that Michel had been staring at. “How do you\nfeel?” Emerald said, sitting down beside him.\n“I’m … not sure. I’m having trouble thinking, and I can barely move. I\ndon’t feel pain. At least, I don’t think I do. My chest is very warm.”\n“That is your body attempting to feel pain. I injected a few drops of pure\nmala directly into your bloodstream.”\n“That explains a lot.” Michel had spent his fair share of time on the mala\npipe—in between jobs, of course—but he’d never quite felt this kind of\nsensation. He wasn’t even aware mala could be injected like this.\n“It was also several hours ago. If I had done so recently, you would have\nsome trouble opening your eyelids.”\n“Right. I’d rather not do this again.” Michel decided that freedom of\nmovement might be preferred, even if it cost him a lot of pain. “How did I\nget here?”\n“You collapsed less than a block from my door. A passerby thought you\nwere dead and reported the body. You’re lucky I was working, or one of my\nassistants might have just tossed you with the rest of the corpses.”\nLucky. Right. “What was the damage?”\n“You were shot in the chest,” Emerald replied, his voice clinical. “The\nbullet lodged between your second and third rib. It was not difficult to\nremove, but you had lost quite a lot of blood by the time you were found.\nYou’ve been drifting in and out of consciousness for two days.”\nTwo damned days. Michel wondered how much had happened in just\nthat time. He had a thousand questions, but bit them back. In due time.\n“Have I been on this slab since then?”\n“Of course not. I had two of my assistants move you here about an hour\nago so you wouldn’t get blood on a bed while I changed your bandages. We\nwere just about to move you back, actually. Too much longer and you’ll\ncatch hypothermia.” Emerald leaned over Michel, his tinted glasses sliding\ndown to the end of his nose as he examined Michel with calm, surprisingly\nblue eyes. “While you’re here, you should try to eat something. I don’t want\nyou throwing up in one of our beds either. Hold on, I think there’s still a\nlittle gruel left over from Horastia’s lunch.”\nMichel listened to Emerald’s footsteps recede, trying to come to grasp\nwith what he would need to do to catch up on the last two days—and how\nhe would deal with it all while recovering from a gunshot wound. He began\nto make a list in his head, shoving his way through the haze of the mala\ninjection, trying to ignore the heat coming from his chest that, without the\nmala, would probably knock him out cold from the pain.\nEmerald returned a moment later and gently put a pillow beneath\nMichel’s head, then spoon-fed him a gruel whose flavor Michel could not\nplace.\n“Has anyone noticed I’m gone?” Michel asked between swallows.\n“They have. Rumors have been spreading that you were shot and killed\nin this quarter, and that your body was tossed in the Hadshaw.”\n“Among who?”\n“The Dynize. The Blackhats, for their part, are confident you’re dead."

The Blackhats, for their part, are confident you’re dead.\nThey’d been shadowing you for days, waiting for you to be alone, and took\nyour little expedition the other day as the perfect opportunity.”\nMichel licked his lips, trying to taste the gruel. Any sensation aside from\nthe few this mala haze would allow him seemed suddenly important. “If\nrumors are spreading among the Dynize, they must have come from\nForgula. No one saw me get shot except for Hendres. I wonder if she found\nme herself, or if Forgula told her where I’ve been staying.”\n“That, I don’t know.”\nMichel realized how tired just eating and talking was making him. He\nhad to focus the thoughts, ask important questions. “The name Mara—is it\nDynize?”\nEmerald seemed caught off guard. He paused with a spoon halfway to\nMichel’s mouth. “It doesn’t sound Dynize. Certainly not one I’ve heard.”\n“Then, what is it?”\n“Gurlish, maybe? Could be Stren.”\nPit. Michel threw a handful of silent curses toward Taniel for not giving\nhim any more clues to accomplish this mission. He tried to think clearly—\nthere had to be a reason for not finding anyone named Mara among the\nDynize. Had Michel remembered the name wrong? Was it some kind of\nsurname, or a nickname? He tried to consider other options, and kept\ncoming around to the fact that he could not fulfill his mission if he could\nnot even find the informant. So what did he do next? Did he flee the danger\nof the city? Or embed himself deeper with the Dynize?\n“What else has happened since I was shot?” Michel asked. “Anything\nimportant?”\n“Another Dynize minister was killed in a bombing.”\n“The minister of rations? She died before I was shot.”\n“I said another. It was a minor minister—road engineering, or\nsomething like that. He was inspecting a bridge about three miles up the\nHadshaw and was killed in an explosion.”\n“Shit,” Michel breathed. He wondered if it was another one of Yaret’s\nallies and was suddenly struck with a thought. “Do you have my clothes?”\n“Your shirt was a total loss. I have your jacket over here. Do you feel\nany nausea?”\n“I’m fine. Look in my jacket pocket for a list of addresses and bring it to\nme.”\nEmerald set the bowl aside and disappeared from Michel’s vision for a\nmoment, before returning with the list and holding it where Michel could\nsee. Michel squeezed his eyes closed, focusing his energy, and lifted his left\narm as high as he dared. Emerald put the list between his fingers.\nHalf the paper had been soaked through with Michel’s blood, making it\nimpossible to read. But the top half was still intact, and Michel scanned his\neyes across the addresses, trying to come up with some sort of pattern.\n“Kingston Street, where is that?” he asked.\n“Lower Landfall, north of the plateau.”\n“And Gorin Way?”\n“That’s on the northern rim of Greenfire Depths.”\nMichel licked his lips. There was a pattern to these addresses. He could\nfeel it, but what it was remained just out of his foggy-brained grasp. “What"

He could\nfeel it, but what it was remained just out of his foggy-brained grasp. “What\ndo all of these addresses have in common?” he whispered.\nEmerald suddenly leaned over him, staring at the paper for a moment\nbefore sitting back down and offering Michel another spoonful of gruel.\n“They’re the locations of the bombings that have been going on the last two\nweeks.”\nMichel’s mouth fell open. “You’re kidding me.” He stared at the\naddresses, going over them again and again. He brought the paper closer to\nhis eyes, noting a light pencil mark beside each address that he’d missed on\nhis initial perusal. It was a number, seemingly nonsensical until he realized\nthat it was the day of the month—this month and last—according to the\nDynize calendar. Each day corresponded perfectly with each bombing at\neach address.\nThis wasn’t just a list of addresses. It was the Blackhat hit list. Either\nForgula had been given this so that she could keep herself out of harm’s\nway, or it was a copy of a list of instructions she’d given to the Blackhats.\nMaybe even both. Michel’s eyes had trouble focusing, his breathing\ngrowing strained.\n“You need to relax,” Emerald told him. “Otherwise you will set your\nhealing back by days.”\nMichel tapped the paper with his thumb. There was an address right\nwhere the blood began to soak the paper, only half of which he could read.\n“What does this say?”\nEmerald took the paper from Michel, studying it a moment. “Seventeen\nChancellor’s Court.”\n“And the number next to it?” Michel’s hand began to tremble from the\neffort of holding up his hand.\nThis time, Emerald’s study took almost a minute. He got up, went to the\ngas lantern in the corner, and held the paper up at several different angles.\n“I think it says eleven.”\n“The eleventh.” Michel struggled against his own sluggishness to try to\nget to his feet. He barely managed to move his head off the pillow.\n“What is it?” Emerald asked.\n“Forgula is using the Blackhats to eliminate Sedial’s enemies,” Michel\nwhispered. “That address is Yaret’s Household. What day is it?”\n“The ninth.”\n“Shit. I have to warn them.”\n“You’re not going to get very far in your condition. You might be able to\nwalk in two or three days, but …”\n“Then you have to warn them,” Michel hissed.\nEmerald raised his eyebrows. “I don’t have to do anything. Certainly not\nsomething that will put me or my people in danger.” The words weren’t said\nunkindly, but his tone was firm.\n“Send a runner! Leave an anonymous note!”\n“I will have no communication on your behalf with the Dynize,”\nEmerald said. “I’m sorry, but it’s too much of a risk. Messengers can be\nrecognized or followed. To be perfectly honest, I haven’t entirely convinced\nmyself I’m not going to euthanize you and dump the body in the river so\nthat you can’t be found here.”\nMichel stared at Emerald, fear creeping in through the haze of the mala."

I will not chop you up\nwhile you sleep, I suppose, but I will also not do anything to risk any of my\npeople. You can leave here once you can walk out on your own accord, but\nI will not involve myself in Dynize affairs.” Emerald clapped his hands,\nstanding up. “You need to rest. My assistants will move you back to a\nproper bed now. I’m afraid they’re not used to carrying live bodies, so this\nmay be slightly uncomfortable.”\nMichel didn’t answer, trying desperately to come up with a way to\nconvince Emerald to warn Yaret about the bombing. Yaret would die if his\nhouse was destroyed. Perhaps Tenik, too. Children would be caught in the\nexplosion and, if it was big enough, dozens of Yaret’s Household.\nIt wasn’t until this moment that Michel realized he didn’t want to lose\nYaret. Not just for the mission but because he’d been the most\nunderstanding master Michel had ever served.\nAnd he was a good man.\nMichel was still trying to come up with something to say when two of\nEmerald’s assistants put their hands beneath him—one under his shoulders,\nanother under his feet—and counted down from three. They reached one\nand lifted, and all the warmth centered around Michel’s chest suddenly\nburst into a brilliant lance of pain that flashed lightning across his senses.\nDespite the pain, Michel could think of only one thing: Yaret was going\nto die in two days. And there was nothing he could do about it.\nCHAPTER 36\nV\nlora spent the next twenty-four hours attempting to catch sight of Prime\nLektor once more. It was, at the heart of it, a game—Vlora spent every\nwaking hour stalking the streets with her hat pulled forward and her collar\nup, trying to find Prime Lektor without him catching sight of her.\nA dangerous game for certain, but it still felt like a game. She jumped at\nevery Prime-shaped shadow and could barely sleep for worry. Prime was\nthe key to all of this; she knew it in her gut. It seemed possible, maybe even\nprobable, that he already knew where the godstone was. If she could follow\nhim more carefully, he might lead her right to it.\nShe gave up late the next day, worried that she was becoming too\nscattered in her search, and headed up to Little Flerring’s place in the hills.\nShe found Flerring inspecting barrels of saltpeter as they were removed\nfrom an ox-drawn wagon. Vlora waited until the inspection was finished,\nthen drew Flerring aside.\n“Have you been able to find out about anything strange going on around\ntown?” she asked.\nFlerring waved down the cart driver, slipping him several extra coins,\nbefore returning to Vlora and rubbing her chin. “You mentioned a madness\nthing last time you were here, right?”\n“Taniel did. Apparently madness seized people at random if they spent\ntoo much time near the artifact.”"

Apparently madness seized people at random if they spent\ntoo much time near the artifact.”\n“Not a lot of weird stuff going on,” Flerring said thoughtfully. “Aside\nfrom the usual fights and killings and mining accidents. But a handful of\nminers up in Nighttime Vale have been hauled away raving mad over the\nlast few weeks.”\nVlora perked up. This was the kind of information she’d been waiting to\nhear. “You couldn’t have mentioned this sooner?”\n“I didn’t know sooner. Just found out a few hours ago. Miners are\nsuperstitious by nature, and Jezzy has been paying the local doctors a heavy\nfee to keep quiet about the whole thing.”\n“Jezzy’s territory, eh?” Vlora swore under her breath. Burt, she might be\nable to bribe or cajole, but Jezzy probably didn’t feel all that kindly toward\nVlora right now. “What can you tell me about the Vale?”\n“It’s a canyon northeast of here,” Flerring answered. “Easy to miss,\nactually. The entrance makes it look tiny, but it opens up into a rather large\nvalley. It would be a great spot for a summer home if there weren’t five\nhundred miners living up there blowing the whole thing to the pit.”\n“Does Jezzy own the whole valley?”\n“That she does. Apparently there’s a real easy gold vein close to the\nsurface. No one goes into that valley if they don’t work for her.”\nVlora considered the information, feeling at once jubilant and annoyed.\nIn almost two weeks this was the first bit of solid intelligence she had. It\nwasn’t guaranteed, of course. Miners weren’t a stable lot, and madness\ncould set in with this heat and dangerous work. But she would give it a\nthorough look, if she could sneak in past Jezzy’s guards. She swore to\nherself, wishing it was Burt’s territory.\n“I need a favor,” Vlora said.\nFlerring frowned down the path leading back to the city as another ox-\ndrawn cart trundled toward them, stacked high with barrels. “What kind of\nfavor? I’m awfully busy right now.”\n“That artifact I told you about?”\n“Yeah?”\n“I need you ready to blow it up at a moment’s notice.”\n“Now?” Flerring asked incredulously.\n“Any time in the next week.”\n“Pit.” Flerring hawked a wad of phlegm into the bushes. “I’ve got to\ncook up a special batch of blasting oil, if what you said about black powder\nis true.”\n“Right, your most powerful stuff.”\n“That takes time.”\n“Time I don’t have.”\nFlerring eyed Vlora for a few moments. “Look, I work in batches, and I\ntake orders. I started putting aside a little of the good stuff the moment you\ntold me there would be a job, but if you want enough to crack through\nsorcery, you’re going to have to wait in line. Jezzy, Burt, and eight\nindependent mining companies are all expecting blasting oil this month.\nAnd they pay ahead of time.”"

Jezzy, Burt, and eight\nindependent mining companies are all expecting blasting oil this month.\nAnd they pay ahead of time.”\n“To the pit with all of them,” Vlora said flatly. She cursed herself for not\nputting in an order properly the moment she laid eyes on Flerring.\nFlerring rubbed her fingers together beneath Vlora’s nose. “They pay\nahead of time, and they pay in gold. Or cash krana. Either is fine with me.”\n“How about a promissory note from the Adran government?”\nFlerring snorted. “A promissory note isn’t gold.”\n“Gold won’t keep all your permits up to date with the Adran\ngovernment,” Vlora responded. “I seem to remember your main\nheadquarters being not that far outside of Adopest.”\nFlerring narrowed her eyes. “You wouldn’t.”\n“I’m not,” Vlora promised. “But I do still have friends in the\ngovernment. I won’t make bad things happen for you—I don’t do business\nlike that—but I will be there to make sure bad things don’t happen to you.\nCatch my meaning?”\n“So you’re saying the next time some asshole minister tries to turn the\npublic against explosives makers as a publicity stunt, you’ll get involved?”\n“Personally.”\nFlerring seemed to consider this. Over the years since the Kez Civil War,\nplenty of politicians had run for public office on the platform of\ndemilitarizing Adro. Some succeeded, which was why Vlora had scooped\nup a whole brigade of Adro’s finest who’d found themselves disbanded.\nOthers aimed for infrastructure and logistics, hoping to shut down the\npowder makers and gunsmiths.\n“All right,” Flerring said finally. She made a shooing motion with her\nhands as the next cart of saltpeter arrived. “You give me your word, and a\ndamned fat promissory note, and I’ll make sure you have as much blasting\noil as you need any time this coming week.”\nVlora took that as a victory and returned to her hotel for dinner, taking a\ncovert snort of powder as she entered the hotel great room and leaving a\npair of coins on the manager’s podium. She didn’t like him, but keeping his\npalms greased might have its uses down the road.\nShe took her usual table and ordered whatever gruel the hotel kitchen\nhad cooked up, sitting back and falling into her own head as she tried to\nwork out her new strategy. She was going to have to reconnoiter Nighttime\nVale, and it sounded like it was already heavily guarded because of Jezzy’s\ngold mine. She briefly considered if Jezzy was working for Lindet directly\n—maybe Jezzy’s men were excavating the second godstone, under the\npretense of mining.\nMaybe, she considered, Nohan was actually one of Lindet’s agents and\nhe was here to oversee the excavation.\nVlora tried to make the pieces work, but it didn’t add up. Nohan was\nobviously a greedy git, and his suggestion that he and Vlora team up and\nsteal all the gold meant he didn’t know the real item of value hiding under\nhis nose.

If she was already excavating the godstone, this whole place would\nbe crawling with Blackhats.\nVlora put her head in her hands. That didn’t add up, either. Lindet was\nheavy-handed, but she wasn’t stupid. Working through intermediaries\nwould keep her from drawing attention to the spot, and not tip off Dynize\nspies by sending an army of Blackhats up here.\nAnd where did Prime Lektor fit into all this? Was he working for\nLindet?\nIn short, Vlora didn’t have any idea what was going on in this damned\ncity. But she needed to find out, and quick.\nShe felt him before she saw him—a dark smudge on her senses, the feel\nof powder grains running down the back of her neck. Nohan entered the\nfront door of the hotel a moment later. He wore short sleeves, showing off a\nnumber of bruises from their fight the other day, and an easy, friendly smile\non his lips as he approached her table.\nHe sat down across from her, his pupils dilated from a powder trance.\nHis eyes betrayed a brief wince as he moved, telling Vlora that he was still\nhurting from being thrown through a table. The knowledge gave her a brief\nstab of satisfaction, which disappeared almost immediately.\n“I know who you are,” he said in a low voice.\nVlora didn’t answer him. She pushed aside her meal and leaned back,\nreaching slowly for the pistol at her belt.\nHe continued. “You’re Lady Flint.”\n“That’s preposterous,” she scoffed.\n“Don’t play me for a fool,” he spat, that easy smile disappearing in the\nblink of an eye. “The latest newspaper from Redstone has a bounty on your\nhead and says your last location was just a couple hundred miles south of\nhere.” He kicked his chair back to rock on the back legs, looking angry but\nself-satisfied. “There aren’t that many powder mages in Fatrasta. Certainly\nnot many that fit your description. You’re Flint.”\nVlora didn’t bother to deny it. He was too sure of himself—further\ndenial would just make him more so. “So what do you want?”\nHe tapped two fingers on the table. “You know what you did to me?”\n“Put you in considerable pain, I hope,” Vlora said flatly, looking at the\nbruises on his arms. Her fingers wrapped around the butt of her pistol. She\ncould try for a quick shot, but he was burning such a strong powder trance\nthat he would doubtlessly be ready for it. Beating him to death in front of\nthirty witnesses seemed like it might not be the best option.\n“No,” he said. “I’m not talking about that. A fight is a fight, and I did try\nto kill you, didn’t I? No, I’m talking about my letter.”\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”\nHe slammed both fists on the table, making her jump. “Don’t play me\nfor a fool!” he growled. “I wrote you a letter three years ago.

I offered you\nmy services—I offered to join the Adran Cabal—and you turned me down\nlike I was some useless Knacked.”\nVlora was bewildered. She didn’t remember this at all. She got perhaps\ntwo hundred such letters every year, and almost all of them were hoaxes\nfrom madmen and disillusioned fools. A secretary usually sorted through\nthem; then Olem examined those that remained. It was—\nHer thoughts cut off as the name finally clicked. Nohan. The powder\nmage who got kicked out of the Starlish Cabal on accusations of treachery\nand cruelty. She could scarcely believe she’d forgotten the situation,\nbecause she’d written to the head of the Starlish Cabal herself to find out if\nNohan had any real talent.\n“You remember now, don’t you,” Nohan said, his eyes intent on her\nface. “I can’t believe you forgot. Arrogant bitch.”\n“I forgot,” Vlora said, “because you weren’t worth my time.”\nNohan exhaled sharply. “Not worth your time? You’re the most famous\npowder mage alive, and I almost killed you the other day. How is that for\nnot worth your time?”\n“Killed me?” Vlora scoffed. “It was a damned fistfight. Besides, it’s not\nall about skill. I turned you down because the head of the Starlish Cabal\nkicked you out for being a sadist.” She leaned forward, seriously\nreconsidering beating him to death in front of witnesses. The Starlish Cabal\nhad included a list of his crimes in their reply, and among them was the\nmurder of children. “I know what goes on in a royal cabal. If they think\nyou’re a sadist, then Adom help your blasted soul.”\nNohan stared daggers at her, and she silently willed him to flip the table\nand come at her. At least then she could kill him in self-defense. She might\nend up in a cell next to Taniel, but at least she wouldn’t be chased out of\ntown by the city deputies.\nNohan gripped the lip of the table, his fingers turning white.\nVlora looked away from him, as if he was beneath her very notice,\nhoping he’d use the chance to attack her. She swept her eyes out the\nwindow, barely noticing the passing traffic as she waited for him to make\nhis move.\nAnd her gaze landed squarely on Prime Lektor.\nThe Privileged sorcerer stood in the street, frowning, staring through the\nwindow directly at her. He was exactly how she remembered him, from the\nthoughtlessly rumpled clothes to the purple birthmark on his face. It was\ndefinitely him, and she could see in his eyes that he had just decided it was\ndefinitely her, too.\nVlora wrenched her attention away from Prime Lektor, preparing to\nthrow herself onto the floor if he decided to unleash sorcery at her. Not that\nit would help. With so much warning, a Privileged of his caliber could\ndestroy the entire block without breaking a sweat.\n“Go on,” Vlora grunted at Nohan. “If you’re so bitter, see if you can take\nme.” Her only consolation if Prime Lektor attacked was that Nohan would"

She couldn’t take Prime in a fair\nfight on a good day, and she wasn’t going to be able to take both him and\nNohan. Might as well focus on one asshole at a time. She wondered if\nNohan took her sudden nerves for fear of him. Laughable.\nIt felt like minutes before Nohan finally broke his stare. He got up,\nlooking down at her with a sneer. “I don’t know why you’re here,” he said\nquietly, “but I’m going to kill you and claim that bounty. Pissing on your\ncorpse before I take it to Redstone will be the best revenge. Watch yourself,\nLady Flint.”\nHe strode out before Vlora could react, and she turned desperately\ntoward the window once he’d left the building. Prime Lektor, however, was\ngone.\nCHAPTER 37\nT\nhe engagement with the Dynize dragoons had left the Mad Lancers badly\nmauled. Unwilling to chance another fight, Styke and Ibana agreed to\nretrace their steps along the coast for two days until, late in the evening,\nthey spotted Fatrastan flags on the horizon.\nStyke sat slumped in the saddle, tired as pit and feeling like he’d been\nkicked in the head by a warhorse. He turned his eyes to the eastern horizon,\nwhere he could see the edge of a Fatrastan camp. Their flags waved in the\nbreeze, torches flickering to life as the sun went down. Styke watched the\ndistant approach of one of his scouts.\n“I think I’m a hypocrite,” he said, giving voice to something he’d been\nconsidering for several days.\nIbana looked sidelong at him. “What kind of nonsense is this?”\nHe shrugged. “I came to the realization that I’m a hypocrite,” he said\nwith more confidence. He’d been thinking about what Valyaine had said,\nsorting through his own memories of the War for Independence all that time\nago and realizing that maybe that treacherous bastard was right—maybe\nStyke was looking at his own participation in the war through the rosy\nlenses of the past. “I’ve always known I was a killer, a monster. But I never\nthought of myself as a hypocrite.”\n“And this is bothering you more than murder?” Ibana asked.\n“Yeah. Yeah, I think it is.”\n“You’re a strange man, Ben Styke.” Ibana spurred her horse, riding out\nto meet the scout.\nStyke exchanged a look with Jackal. The Palo bannerman shrugged.\nStyke sighed and rode out after Ibana, meeting the scout on a nearby hill. It\nwas Ferlisia, one of the longest-standing members of the lancers. She\nsnapped a salute.\n“Did you talk to them?” Styke asked.\n“Just briefly,” Ferlisia reported. “It’s the Third Army.”"

When he’d decided to pull back after that fight\nwith the Dynize, he’d figured they would have to head all the way back to\nBellport to find some relief. He hadn’t expected to find the Third Army\nalready out on the Hammer. They must have marched straight past Bellport\nwithout stopping.\nStyke had a glimmer of suspicion that they’d been sent after the lancers\nbut dismissed the notion. Lindet wouldn’t send a field army of infantry to\nchase a highly mobile cavalry force.\nShe would, however, send them to secure the godstone.\nRegardless, the Mad Lancers needed somewhere to lie low. “I’ll go see\nif they’ll let us lick our wounds inside their pickets,” he said, lifting his\nreins.\nBoth Ibana and Ferlisia looked alarmed. “Sir, the commanding officer is\n—”\nStyke waved Ferlisia off. “I know who it is. Dvory. That’s why I’m\ngoing to ask myself.”\n“That’s not a great idea,” Ibana said in a low voice.\nStyke looked over his shoulder at his column of lancers. They’d lost\nnearly half their number to death or wounds in the Dynize ambush. They\ndidn’t have healing Privileged or proper surgeons to deal with the wounded.\nThey’d done so well and come so far, only to be blindsided by a superior\ncavalry force. Styke did not want to meet that force again without taking\nsome time to recover.\n“If Dvory betrayed you once, he’ll do it again,” Ibana said.\n“Perhaps. He might not know I’ve been killing his old conspirators,\nthough.”\n“He’ll have passed through Bellport. There’s no way he won’t have\ngotten word from Valyaine. You damn well should have killed Valyaine\nwhen you had the chance.”\n“Yeah, I know.” Styke wasn’t thrilled about the idea of marching in there\nto ask for help from someone who’d betrayed him. But his meditations over\nhypocrisy the last few days had given him a more optimistic outlook than\nhe’d expected. “Look, if those dragoons snuck up on us once, they can do it\nagain. We need to recover, and this saves us having to go all the way back\nto Bellport. We get inside their pickets and we’ll be safe until we can\nregroup.”\nIbana pursed her lips, clearly wanting to argue.\nStyke forestalled it with a raised hand. “I’ll deal with Dvory. If I’m not\nback in two hours, head south and try to throw them off your trail.”\nHe began to ride toward the camp without explaining himself further\nand tried to gather his thoughts. He wondered if maybe he’d known all\nalong that he was a hypocrite, and that’s what had truly kept him from\nkilling Tenny Wiles. He wondered if maybe being broken by the labor\ncamps had been a blessing to everyone around him, rather than the blow\nagainst the brave Mad Lancers that he’d always considered it.\nHe frowned into the setting sun at one point, only to see a small group of"

They were all on\nhorseback—four of them, if his eyes weren’t playing tricks on him.\nThose goddamn dragonmen, still plaguing his trail. Another good reason\nto spend a few days hugging a field army.\nHe was pulled from his contemplations by the sound of a horse whinny\nbehind him. He turned in his saddle, a rebuke on his lips to send Celine\nback to the lancers.\nBut it wasn’t Celine. It was Ka-poel.\nOf course it was.\nHe waited for her to catch up, trying to figure out what he could say to\nsend her away. Going to see Dvory was already a dangerous gamble. A wild\ncard like Ka-poel might make things worse. But she’d already made it\nabundantly clear that he couldn’t leave her behind.\n“I think,” he told her as she arrived, “that some dysfunction in the back\nof my brain silently tells me that I’m invincible.” He wasn’t sure why he\nshared the thought, but he continued. “Maybe I’ve had it my whole life.\nMaybe it was surviving the firing squad. Maybe it wasn’t until more\nrecently, when I survived that fight with Fidelis Jes. Or maybe it was\nsomething you put in my head with your damned blood sorcery. I don’t\nreally care, but I have the feeling that it’s going to get me killed.”\nKa-poel stopped beside him, watching him through half-lidded eyes.\n“I was watching that sign language you’re teaching Celine,” he said. “I\nhadn’t realized it before, but it looks like a jumble of Palo war signals and\nsomething else.”\nKa-poel smiled coolly at him and nodded.\nStyke felt pleased to have remembered as well as he did. He hadn’t seen\nPalo war signals for over ten years, and even then he’d only picked up on\nthe very basics while he was in the Tristan Basin. “Did Ibana tell you what\nI’m doing?” he asked.\nKa-poel made a series of gestures.\nStyke shook his head. “I said I recognized it. Not that I understand it.”\nShe pointed at him, then mimed hanging from a noose. You’re trying to\nget yourself killed.\n“I wouldn’t say I’m trying,” Styke said. He had a sudden worry that\nmaybe he was trying to get himself killed and he didn’t even know it. He’d\nalways chalked his own courage up to a lack of fear, but maybe it wasn’t so\nsimple. “I’m not trying,” he insisted. “We need surgeons and protection\nwhile we put ourselves back together. But Dvory might try to kill me. If he\ndoes, I intend on taking him with me. You probably should go back to Ibana\nuntil I sort this out.”\nKa-poel pursed her lips and tilted her head. That, Styke understood.\n“Suit yourself.”\nKa-poel put her slate away as they rode up to the sentries. One of them\nstepped forward, eyeing Styke and his horse. “State your name, rank, and\nbusiness.”"

        "text": "“Suit yourself.”\nKa-poel put her slate away as they rode up to the sentries. One of them\nstepped forward, eyeing Styke and his horse. “State your name, rank, and\nbusiness.”\n“I need to see your quartermaster,” he said. “Then I need to see General\nDvory.”\n“Name and rank?” the sentry demanded.\n“Colonel Ben Styke.”\nThe sentry’s eyes widened. “Oh. Right. I, uh, better have someone escort\nyou to the general.”\nStyke and Ka-poel were led through the camp. He was pleasantly\nsurprised to find that the Fatrastan Army was significantly more organized\nthan they had been during the War for Independence, with clean rows of\ntents and clearly marked regiments, companies, and platoons. It was the\nfirst time he’d been in a Fatrastan army camp in over ten years, and he felt\nmore than a little nostalgia for the old days.\nThey were led to a large tent in the middle of the camp. Two guards\nstood at the entrance, bayonets fixed, and Styke was able to tell which one\nrecognized him by the way the man straightened, inhaling sharply.\nTheir escort called out his name and rank and then went inside the tent,\nemerging a moment later. His face was pale. “General Dvory will see you\nnow, Colonel Styke.”\n“That was quick,” Styke commented dryly. “Stay here,” he told Ka-poel,\nducking into the tent.\nDvory was much as Styke remembered him—an unassuming-looking\nman with the dusky skin of a full-blooded Rosvelean. He was slim, of\nmedium height with black hair and a plain face. At some point in the last\ndecade he’d begun to wear spectacles. His bottom lip drooped slightly,\ngiving most people the impression he was stupid, which, Styke remembered\nquite clearly, was not the case.\n“Ben Styke,” Dvory said, standing up from behind his desk. He folded\nhis spectacles and set them on a book he’d been reading.\n“Dvory,” Styke replied.\n“It’s General Dvory now. You may call me sir.”\nStyke ambled over to the chair on the opposite side of the table from\nDvory and sat down, listening to it creak angrily under his weight. Dvory\nwas an honest-to-god real general. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.\nDvory had always been competent, but not “make me a general” levels of\ncompetent. Nowhere close. “Fat goddamn chance of that. You’re welcome\nto try to have me beaten for insubordination. We’ll see how that goes for\neveryone involved.”\nDvory managed a pained expression and lowered himself into his chair.\n“I expected you sooner or later,” he said. “Unfortunately, I expected the\nattitude as well. I heard you beheaded Fidelis Jes?”\n“I asked to see the quartermaster,” Styke replied. “I think it’s ironic they\nbrought me straight to you, considering you used to be one of my\nquartermasters. Yeah, I beheaded Fidelis Jes. He had it coming.”\n“I see.” Dvory reached for a cigarette box, opened the lacquered lid, and"

        "text": "quartermasters. Yeah, I beheaded Fidelis Jes. He had it coming.”\n“I see.” Dvory reached for a cigarette box, opened the lacquered lid, and\nplucked out a cigarette. He lit it with a match, inhaling deeply, and Styke\nthought he saw just the slightest tremble to his hand. “It’s a pity,” Dvory\ncontinued. “Fidelis Jes was a great man.”\n“He was a prick, and everyone knew it.”\n“Great men can be pricks,” Dvory said. “Take yourself, for instance.”\nStyke interrupted with a snort. “You think I’m a great man?”\n“Absolutely! You were, anyway. I understand you’re a shadow of your\nformer self, but you still have that attitude—that disregard for your betters\nthat got you put in front of a firing squad.” Dvory paused to smoke, looking\nover Styke’s shoulder thoughtfully. “You’ve always been a pompous piece\nof garbage and yet … still a great man.”\nStyke ignored the insults, focusing on Dvory’s careless appearance. Was\nhe trying to goad Styke into attacking him? Or did he just assume he was\nsafe in the middle of his army? Styke produced his most condescending\nsmile. “Have you been practicing that speech in a mirror?”\n“Excuse me?”\n“The ‘great man’ thing. I bet you’ve been practicing that ever since you\nfound out I killed Jes.”\nDvory’s eyes narrowed. He took a deep breath, ashing his cigarette into\na half-empty glass of whiskey. Again, Styke noted that the carelessness of it\nseemed too performative. Dvory wanted Styke to think he didn’t give a\ndamn about him anymore. “Why are you here, Styke? Did you come to kill\nme? I heard Agoston disappeared. Tenny Wiles, too. Valyaine, though … he\nbeat the shit out of you in Bellport. That must have been something to see.\nHave you softened in your old age?”\n“I could kill you now,” Styke mused aloud.\n“And die by the hands of my guards. Not even you can fight a field\narmy, Styke.”\nStyke leaned forward, listening to the chair creak. He drew his knife and\nplanted the tip against the top of Dvory’s table, spinning it. To his credit,\nDvory ignored the knife and kept his eyes on Styke’s face. But even with\nthat bravado, he could almost hear Dvory wondering if the prospect of\ndeath would stop Styke from having his revenge. “No,” Styke said,\nwatching his knife spin before plucking it up in his hand. “I’m not here to\nkill you.”\n“Oh?” Dvory blinked in surprise.\n“Of course not. We’re on the same side, aren’t we?”\n“Are we?” Dvory asked. “No one reinstated the Mad Lancers. No one\nmade you a colonel again.”\nStyke used his boz knife to trim his fingernails. “That’s not entirely true.\nLady Vlora Flint reinstated the Mad Lancers and my rank.”\n“A traitor with a price on her head,” Dvory scoffed.\n“A patriot who just happened to piss off Lindet,” Styke said."

That puts us on the same side. Or would\nyou like to go back to Bellport and ask the mayor who arrived to save the\ncity in the nick of time?”\n“Ah,” Dvory said, as if something had just occurred to him. “I wondered\nwhere the old goat got a spine. You put him up to it, didn’t you? Told him\nnot to let the army strip the city for supplies.” He shook his head. “He’s\nlucky we didn’t need anything or I would have had him hanged.” Dvory\nmade a vexed sound in the back of his throat. “I should have you hanged for\ninsubordination.”\n“Go ahead,” Styke said, calling what they both knew was a bluff.\nDvory stubbed out his cigarette and scowled at Styke. “Don’t think I\nwouldn’t. Fortunately for you, I have strict instructions not to kill you or\nyour men.”\nThat did surprise Styke. He leaned back and put his knife away. “From\nwho?”\n“Who do you think? From Lindet. I saw her a month ago on her trip\nfrom Landfall to Redstone. She specifically said she wanted you left to your\nown devices unless you outright attacked a Fatrastan army.” Dvory frowned\nat a spot above Styke’s head. “Jes warned me a decade ago that Lindet had\na soft spot for you.”\n“When he asked you to help separate me from Ibana and the others so he\ncould execute me?”\n“That’s right.”\n“I just wanted to be clear on that point,” Styke said. He considered\nlunging across the table. He could bury his knife in Dvory’s chest before he\nmade a sound. He might even be able to make it to the edge of the camp\nbefore the alarm was raised. But it wasn’t worth the risk, not when he\nneeded to look after his own. “You asked why I’m here. The lancers need a\nplace to lie low for a couple of days. I want to do that inside your pickets.”\nDvory looked like he’d been slapped. “Did you just ask me for help?”\n“I did.”\n“Wait. I told you straight out that I betrayed you, and you turn around\nand ask for my help?” He sounded truly incredulous.\nStyke resisted the urge to roll his eyes. “That’s right.”\nDvory stood up, pacing from one end of the tent to the other before\nretaking his seat. He rocked back and forth like a child unable to come to\ngrasp with their emotions, then plucked up another cigarette. “Why should I\nhelp you?”\n“Because I’m doing your job for you,” Styke said. “Because patching\nthings up with Ben Styke would be a damned good career move right now.\nBecause you used to be a Mad Lancer and unless you’re as cold as you’re\npretending, some of those people riding with me were your friends.”\nDvory swallowed hard, but did not respond.\nStyke sat forward and put his elbows on Dvory’s table.

He said in a quiet\nvoice, “Two days ago, we were ambushed by a force of Dynize dragoons.\nThey ambushed us. Me, Ibana, Jackal, all the rest. They took us by surprise.\nNow, I know you don’t want to deal with a force of dragoons alone, not one\nskilled enough to sneak up on the Mad Lancers. They might not be able to\ncrack a whole field army, but they can make your life miserable. But if you\ngive us a couple of days to rest, we’ll be on our way without taxing your\nsupplies—and then I intend on hunting down those dragoons and\nbutchering them. Like I said … I’m doing your job for you.”\n“We’re heading west,” Dvory said. “We move on tomorrow.”\n“We’ll move with you,” Styke said. “And sleep inside your pickets. You\ncan use a few of the old lancers as scouts if you want.”\nDvory seemed genuinely torn. He fiddled with the butt of his\nextinguished cigarette, his face looking like he’d just swallowed a lime. “If\nI allow this,” he said, “are we square?”\n“We’re square.” Then Styke reached across the table and shook hands\nwith a man who had once betrayed him. He forced a smile on his face and\ntightened his grip just a little.\nIbana wasn’t going to let him hear the end of it.\nDvory showed Styke out of the tent, and Styke was only slightly surprised\nthat the initial two guards had become twenty, all of them with bayonets\nfixed and all of them pretending that they hadn’t been waiting for some\nkind of signal as the two men exited. Ka-poel stood by a nearby torch, arms\nfolded, flames dancing in her eyes. Her face was unreadable.\n“Who is this?” Dvory asked, gesturing to her.\n“My servant,” Styke said.\n“A Palo, eh? I heard your tastes had gotten … significantly younger\nsince you left the labor camps.”\nStyke leaned sideways as if whispering to a friend, a smile plastered on\nhis face. “Speak like that of my girl again and you will live out the rest of\nyour life as a torso and a head in a flour sack.”\nA bead of sweat rolled down Dvory’s forehead. “What are you doing out\nhere?” he asked, quickly changing the subject.\n“Asking for your help.”\n“No. Here, on the Hammer.”\n“Killing Dynize.” Styke joined Ka-poel, touching her elbow and\npointing in the direction they’d left their horses. “Good-bye, Dvory. Don’t\nforget to tell your pickets to expect my men.”\nWhen they were finally out of sight, Styke turned aside and spat into the\ngrass. His mouth tasted of bile, his nerves shot, and he suddenly realized\njust how close he’d actually come to killing Dvory. Every muscle was sore\nand tight from the tension.\n“I just asked a favor of a man who once betrayed me,” he told Ka-poel.\nKa-poel pursed her lips, pinching two fingers together and thrusting"

It took several moments in the poor light to\nrealize that she held a single human hair. It took him another few moments\nto realize the significance.\nHe barked a laugh. “Does that belong to Dvory?”\nShe nodded.\nHe felt a little of the tension leak off, and rolled his shoulders to loosen\nhis muscles. “Leave him alone for now,” he said. “You can keep the hair—it\nmight come in handy.

Her hair\nwas unkempt, her jacket dirty, and she could only imagine the bags under\nher eyes.\nShe leaned her head against the bars of Taniel’s jail cell. “They both\nknow who I am.”\nHe frowned as she spoke. “Who?”\n“The powder mage, Nohan. He put two and two together and called me\nout. Says he’s going to kill me and take the bounty that Lindet put out on\nme.”\n“Can he?”\n“Not in a fair fight.”\n“Right. Why didn’t you just kill him when he threatened you?”\n“Because I don’t want to end up in here with you,” Vlora replied.\n“So buy him off,” Taniel said, as if the answer were simple.\nVlora stared at Taniel, furious with him for suggesting it, and furious\nwith herself for not just doing it in the first place. “I will not buy off a man\nwho has tried to kill me. It’s personal now—and I don’t think he would take\nme up on it. Apparently we have a history.”\nTaniel didn’t ask further, so Vlora didn’t bother to explain. He sketched\nfuriously, his hand moving over the page manically, and she could tell that\nsitting in this cell was bothering the pit out of him. “Who else knows who\nyou are?”\n“Prime Lektor.”\nTaniel’s sketching stopped. He looked up, staring at the wall, then\nlooked over at her. “You saw him again?”\n“Twice more. Definitely him, even though I can’t sense his sorcery. The\nfirst time, I tried to follow him and he disappeared into thin air. I know\nwhere he lives, but I’m not touching a Predeii’s house. It’s probably warded\nas tight as a king’s palace. The second time I saw him—well, he spotted me\nfirst. Now he knows I’m here.”\n“That’s not great,” Taniel said with a frown.\nVlora rubbed her eyes. “Do we really know anything about him? Why\ndoes he want the stone? He’s a scholar, isn’t he? Maybe he’s just studying\nit?”\n“He’s also part of the group that summoned Kresimir and caused the\nBleakening,” Taniel warned."

He helped turn Adro into a democracy.”\n“We can’t trust him.” Taniel looked down at his sketchbook. He\nsuddenly dropped his charcoal and ripped the page out, crumpling it and\ntossing it into one corner of the cell. Vlora raised her eyebrows. It was the\nfirst time she’d ever seen him destroy a drawing in anger—even the terrible\nones from his youth. “I need to get out of here,” he said.\nVlora didn’t disagree.\n“I can try to break out tonight,” he said, “but there’s a ton of miscreants\nin here and a heavy guard on them. I’ll probably end up killing my way\nout.” He didn’t seem happy about this idea. “I don’t like killing decent\npeople, and the deputies here are probably the only ones in the whole city.”\nVlora didn’t like the idea, either. “We have to give it another week.”\n“You’ll get killed,” Taniel countered. “You can handle a rogue powder\nmage, but Prime is out of your league.”\n“I won’t.” Her mind raced. “I can change hotels and keep my head\ndown. Flerring tipped me off to men going mad at one of the mining sites.\nIf I can get inside, I might be able to find the stone; by the time I find the\nstone, you’ll be out. We can deal with Prime and then bring Olem and the\nboys into town to claim the stone.”\n“It’s risky,” Taniel said slowly.\nOnce again, Vlora didn’t disagree. But she could still move around the\ntown freely, and she could still hide from both her antagonists. “Give me\none more week,” she said. “Then we deal with both of them together, and\nFlerring will have enough blasting oil for us to try to destroy the stone.\nHave you heard any more news from your Palo friend?”\n“Not much that’s useful. You really want to do this on your own, don’t\nyou?” he asked with a sigh.\nVlora wanted to tell him that she couldn’t trust him anymore. She\nwanted to tell him that he was no longer human and that he was no longer\nthe Adran patriot who had been a hero of two wars. She wanted to tell him\nthat she did need to do this herself. “I want to do this without you having to\nkill decent people,” she reasoned. “And without drawing any more\nattention.”\n“Even if it gets you killed?”\n“I’ve fought worse.”\n“I know,” Taniel said softly, “but you’re my friend. I don’t want you to\ndie.”\nVlora almost told him her thoughts, overwhelmed by a feeling of guilt\nover her mistrust of him. She bit her tongue. “I’m glad,” she managed.\nTaniel paced the cell. “The Palo Nation definitely has a presence in the\ncamp, but I can’t figure out how big.

She wondered what was going\non with Ka-poel. Taniel claimed he could sense her, even at a distance. She\nimagined that was as stressful as it was useful.\nHer own exhaustion—and separation from her lover and partner—were\ndragging at her. Her bruises hurt all the time; her body was exhausted from\ntoo little rest. She had to run a light powder trance and drink a bottle of\nwine just to think clearly.\nVlora turned to Taniel, remembering her thoughts about Prime from the\nother day. “You said the sorcerous compass Ka-poel gave you isn’t\nworking?”\n“That’s right,” Taniel responded. He chuckled. “Compass. Right. That\nmakes sense. Well, it’s behaving like I’ve put a magnet underneath a real\ncompass. I know that the stone is here, but it’s not pointing in any direction\nin particular.”\n“Maybe that’s Prime’s doing.”\n“How?”\n“Perhaps Prime is hiding the stone on purpose, to keep anyone from\nfinding it until he’s finished with it.”\nTaniel stroked the two-week-old stubble growing on his chin. “That\nsounds right. So if you find Prime again, you can follow him to the stone.”\n“I don’t want to find Prime. I want to find the stone, then deal with him\nonce I have you with me.”\n“That seems wiser,” Taniel said.\nVlora pushed herself away from the cell glass. She felt like a wagon\nstuck in a muddy rut, unable to pull out of it even with her best effort. She\nhad to get back to work before she went mad. “I’m going,” she told him,\nholding up a single finger. “One week. You’ll be out without having to kill,\nand I’ll have found the stone.”\n“One week,” Taniel agreed reluctantly.\nVlora left him there, ducking out of the jail and weaving into traffic, her\neyes on the rooftops for the telltale puff of smoke from a fired rifle. By\ndeciding to do this alone, she hoped she hadn’t just proclaimed her own\ndeath warrant.\nCHAPTER 39\nW\nalking up the stairs of the Landfall City Morgue was the most painful\nthing that Michel had ever done.\nHe rested for as long as he dared—until early in the morning on the\neleventh, when last night’s injection of mala had finally begun to wear off.\nPulling himself out of the bed in a dark corner room of the underground"

        "text": "eleventh, when last night’s injection of mala had finally begun to wear off.\nPulling himself out of the bed in a dark corner room of the underground\nmorgue was almost painful enough to put him on his back, to not care if the\nentire Yaret Household was about to die to a Blackhat bombing. But he\nmanaged to make it out of the bed and even find a bit of horngum in\nEmerald’s laboratory before slipping out behind the backs of Emerald’s\nassistants.\n“Slipping,” Michel considered as he climbed the stairs up to the street,\nwas probably a poor word. He dragged himself along the walls, then along\nhandrails, up every excruciating step. Emerald had been very clear that he\nshouldn’t move if he wanted to recover quickly—that leaving the morgue\ntoo early might put him back in it as a corpse. Emerald had also made it\nclear that he would keep Michel tied to the bed if he needed to.\nBut Michel didn’t have time for any of that. If he didn’t act, Yaret would\ndie, and with him the Household. It would kill Michel’s best chance of\nfinding Taniel’s elusive informant—and it would also kill people whom\nMichel had come to think of as friends.\nMichel stopped on the second landing and bit off a piece of horngum\nlarge enough to make his mouth go numb almost instantly. It helped with\nthe pain without dulling his senses, but he needed another bite after just two\nmore flights of stairs.\nHe mentally detached himself from his body as he climbed, in a vain\nattempt to ignore the pain. It was something he did when he wanted to get\ninto the right mind-set for a new job—when he had to become a totally\ndifferent person. It involved floating mentally, a sort of forced high where\nhe envisioned himself outside his earthly body looking in, trying to find a\ndifferent perspective that would help him infiltrate the next mission.\nIn this case, he simply attempted to meditate, and he couldn’t help but\nconsider the complexity of becoming these different people—that the man\nwhom his Dynize allies would call Michel Bravis was a different man than\nthe Blackhats, or Taniel, would refer to by the same name. They were all\nstill him, of course, but … not. He couldn’t help but think of his mother, of\ndeceiving her for all those years into thinking he was a loyal Blackhat when\nin fact he was still the Palo loyalist that she’d always wanted for a son.\nHe wondered if the guilt of that one deception was what drove him to\nkeep climbing these stairs, even through the pain that cut past the vestiges\nof last night’s mala and a healthy chunk of horngum. Perhaps saving the\nYaret Household—people who had taken him in, given him trust, and\ndefended him to their own allies—would somehow absolve him of all the\ninstances of so-called friends that he’d betrayed in the past.\nAt some point, he realized, he would have to betray Yaret. He would add\nTenik, the Household, and all of Dynize to the long list of people who\nwanted to kill him.\nBut not yet.\nHe finally reached the top of the stairs and froze, staring at the open\ndoor of the morgue’s front entrance and Emerald, who had stopped with his\nfoot halfway in, a loaf of bread under one arm."

He nodded.\n“You look paler than me. We have an elevator we use to bring the\ncorpses up and down. I would have let you take it.”\n“I didn’t think you were going to let me leave,” Michel managed, taking\nstrength from a surge of anger. An elevator would have saved him so much\npain.\nEmerald nodded solemnly. “I would have advised you stay. But if you’re\ndetermined enough to climb five flights of stairs, I won’t stop you.” He\ntipped his hat. “Best of luck,” he said, heading down the stairs.\nMichel hated Emerald for the extra little skip in his step, then pushed out\nthe door and into the streets. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the\nlight and get his bearings. He would have to go directly to Yaret’s House in\nChancellor’s Court. It was risky—either from running into Sedial’s people\nor because he might get caught in the blast himself.\nWalking on flat ground was easier than up the stairs, but Michel still\nfound himself moving with frustrating slowness. Each step seemed like\nanother mountain to climb, and whenever he couldn’t find a wall to lean on,\nhe was forced to concentrate just to keep from falling over.\nThe sight of a carriage rolling down the next street over nearly made\nhim faint. He raised his hand, shaking two fingers at the driver, who pulled\nup and came to a stop just ahead of him.\n“Heading home, sir,” the driver told him. “I worked all night. No more\nfares for me.”\n“Chancellor’s Court,” Michel gasped. “Please, just one more.”\nThe driver leaned over, peering at Michel. “You don’t look so good.”\nCarriages were not very common since the invasion. Most had been used to\ntake their owners out of the city ahead of the Dynize. Those that remained\nhad to get licensed with the Dynize government and install a large green\nsign on their side declaring their license. If Michel didn’t convince the\ndriver, he might not see another till the capitol building.\n“I don’t feel so good, either.” Michel rummaged in his pockets and\nfound two Dynize rations cards, as well as the card that Tenik had given\nhim weeks ago that marked him as a member of Yaret’s Household. He\ndamn well hoped that the driver knew what it was. “Look,” Michel said,\n“here’s these. This card says I’m employed by the state. Take me and I’ll\nmake sure they pay you double.”\nThe driver looked uneasy. “Look, fella, I don’t want to get involved with\nthe Dynize. Bad luck and all. But I’m heading that direction anyway. Give\nme the rations cards and I’ll take you to Forlorn End.”\nForlon End, if Michel remembered right, was just a few blocks from\nChancellor’s Court. “Done.”\nIt was all Michel could do to climb into the carriage and collapse on the\nbench, where he clutched his aching chest and tried not to swear with each"

His breathing was shallow, his eyelids heavy,\nand he wondered what he was going to say to Yaret once he arrived.\nConvincing him to disrupt the Household and evacuate the street over a\nbloodstained list of addresses was probably going to be harder than it\nsounded.\nHe thanked the driver and climbed out at Forlorn End, before shambling\nas quickly as he could press himself down the street toward Chancellor’s\nCourt. He took a left down a narrow alley, intent on cutting across a handful\nof small streets to shave precious yards off his trip. He kept holding his\nbreath, watching the sky, waiting for the blast of an explosion and a tower\nof flame.\nMichel let himself through the garden of one of the townhouse mansions\nand came out into a courtyard less than a block from Yaret’s Household.\nThe moment he stepped out of the garden, he regretted his shortcut.\nHis eyes caught sight of Forgula at the same instant she saw him. She\nstood with several members of the Sedial Household, talking in the street\ndirectly in the way of Michel’s route. Michel swallowed hard, a cold sweat\nbreaking out on the small of his back, his heart rate doubling.\nForgula tapped one of her companions and pointed, her face growing\ncold at the sight of Michel. The group turned toward him immediately,\nwalking briskly. “Stay put, spy,” she called to him.\nMichel began to walk briskly in the opposite direction, hoping that the\neffort didn’t knock him off his feet, and backtracked toward the next street\nover. He needed to get somewhere with witnesses—no, with Yaret\nwitnesses.\nHe didn’t know if Forgula had guessed that he had searched her home,\nor if she just wanted him out of the way, but he knew that if she caught him\nbefore he could reach a friendly Dynize, he would be dead within minutes.\nHe risked a jog, looking over his shoulder to see Forgula and her cronies do\nthe same.\nHe felt stitches tear in his chest and a shot of pain that blinded him for\nseveral moments. He nearly tripped and fell, stumbling into the mouth of an\nalley.\nA handful of children playing in the mud caught his eye. He recognized\ntwo of them—definitely members of Yaret’s Household—and he fumbled in\nhis pocket for a nub of pencil and a paper. He scribbled three words, then\nsigned his name. “You,” he called to one of the girls in Dynize. “Take this\nto Yaret immediately. Run, and don’t look back!”\nThe girl looked at Michel with some confusion before her eyes flicked\nto Forgula’s group coming on behind him. She gave a quick nod, took the\npaper, and dashed off toward the Yaret Household. Forgula shouted after\nher, but the girl kept running.\nMichel leaned against the corner of a building and wondered if this was\nthe best he could do. Forgula would be on him in moments.

He was bleeding so\nheavily that Forgula wouldn’t need to kill him.\nHe gave a soft laugh at how close he’d come to reaching Yaret, and\nresumed his walk. Behind him, he could hear the footsteps of Forgula and\nher people, which had slowed. They must have noticed his condition,\nrealized that they could take their time. Michel forced himself to raise his\nhead, looking around for some kind of salvation as he reached the next\nstreet corner and sought an ally.\nNo one caught his eye. He half bent, put his hands on his knees, trying\nto choke back tears of pain. At some point in his journey he had lost the rest\nof his horngum.\n“Shit,” he muttered to himself, and turned to face Forgula.\nHe was surprised to find that Forgula’s group had stopped less than ten\nfeet from him, and it took him a moment to realize why.\nA carriage was parked on the side of the street. It was drawn by two\nbrilliant black horses and had the black and red curtains of a Dynize\ndiplomat. A familiar face was leaning out the window, watching Michel and\nForgula.\nIt was Saen-Ichtracia, the Privileged who’d laughed when Michel\npunched Forgula.\nIchtracia appraised Michel with a single glance, then turned to Forgula.\n“You have murder in your eyes, my dear,” she said.\nForgula’s nostrils flared. There was an uncertainty to her stance that\nseemed at contrast with being waylaid by the granddaughter of her master.\n“There’s a snake in our midst,” Forgula replied. “I was about to crush it.”\n“Oh, come now, is that necessary? It looks like a stiff breeze would\nknock him over.”\n“Then it’s a mercy killing,” Forgula said. Her blackjack slid from her\nsleeve to her hand, and she took a step toward Michel.\nIchtracia tutted loudly, stopping Forgula midstride. “Michel, my little\nmongrel foxhead, what are you doing on this street? And in your condition?\nYou should be smart enough to stay on the next street over.”\nMichel looked down at the blood now dripping openly from the hand he\nheld over his chest. He used the last of his strength to force a smile onto his\nface, giving a small bow and grasping for the first thing that came to mind.\n“I was looking for you, ma’am.”\n“Oh? Whatever for?”\n“To ask you to dinner.” Michel had just long enough to see the look of\nfascinated horror on Forgula’s face before he teetered and collapsed,\nfacedown, onto the cobbles beneath Ichtracia’s carriage.\n“That is the third time this week I have passed out,” Michel breathed. He\nlay in a pile on the floor of a carriage, looking up at Ichtracia as she stared\ndispassionately out the window. One of her footmen crouched beside him,\nholding his jacket tightly against Michel’s chest. “It’s really unpleasant.”\nIchtracia remained silent, her eyes on something in the street, a troubled\nlook on her face.

Michel tried to read something from her posture and\nexpression—why she had saved him, what her plans were, if she was going\nto help him—but came up with nothing. He couldn’t focus through the pain\ncoming from his wound, nor the great loss of blood. Instead, he found\nhimself considering her striking features. A man could do worse than stare\nat her face as he died.\nThe carriage was moving, but Michel had no way of knowing in what\ndirection. “Thank you,” he said.\n“Hmm?” Ichtracia looked down at him, her eyes cold, her thoughts\nobviously far away. “Oh, that.” She snorted a laugh. “Having the chance to\nannoy Forgula is thanks enough.”\nMichel thought of the laugh when he’d punched Forgula back at the war\ngame. Was there some kind of old rivalry between the two? Past hatreds?\nShouldn’t they be on the same side? “I have to go to Yaret’s Household,” he\nsaid.\nIchtracia ignored him. “Tculu, will he survive long enough to reach the\nhouse?”\n“He’s still talking, ma’am,” the footman replied. “I think that’s a good\nsign.”\n“Saen,” Michel said, trying to inject some force. “I have to get to Yaret’s\nHousehold, please. I have to warn them.”\nIchtracia’s attention snapped toward him with a startling suddenness.\n“About what? The bomb?”\nMichel’s throat went dry. Ichtracia knew. She knew because she was Ka-\nSedial’s granddaughter, and Ka-Sedial had arranged the assassination. He\nhad just stepped out of one fire and into a much, much hotter one.\n“Oh, don’t look at me like that,” Ichtracia said. “I didn’t put the damned\nthing there. You’ve been unconscious for about a half hour. Fifteen minutes\nago, a bomb exploded, destroying Yaret’s house. We heard the explosion,\nand word just reached us by courier.”\nMichel stared at her, trying to come up with a reply. Maybe she wasn’t\ninvolved, but … had he been too late? Had that girl gotten his note to Yaret\nin time? “We have to go help,” he whispered.\n“Do we? Yaret isn’t a friend of mine, and I’ve been given no orders to\nreturn and aid them.”\nMichel had no strength to feel grief, or outrage, or anything but the pain\ncoming from his chest. He sagged, doing everything he could to keep his\neyes open as the carriage finally came to a stop. The door opened, and at\nIchtracia’s order he was carried, none too gently, down the drive of a small\nestate and in through the front door. A candelabra was swept\nunceremoniously off a large dining room table and Michel was laid down in\nthe middle, with Ichtracia standing over him like she was about to quarter a\ndeer.\n“Fetch me my tools,” she told a footman before looking at Michel. “I’m\ngoing to do what I can for you,” she said. “You’ve lost a lot of blood, but it"

If we can keep you\nconscious, you should make a full recovery.”\n“Are … are you a healing Privileged?”\n“I am not.” Ichtracia took a satchel from one of the footmen, set it next\nto Michel’s head, and began to lay out tools. “My great-grandfather was a\nPrivileged,” she explained. “He pioneered a combination of sorcery and\nsurgery that greatly increases a patient’s chances of surviving. It is not\nnearly as effective—and much more painful—than healing sorcery. But it\nworks.” She pulled on her Privileged’s gloves, the sight of which caused\nMichel to involuntarily attempt to get up and run. One of Ichtracia’s fingers\ntwitched, and Michel was pressed against the table by unseen forces.\n“Tculu,” she said, “fetch Michel some whiskey from the cabinet. Give him\na healthy swig, then put your belt between his teeth.”\nMichel could barely keep up. Ichtracia moved quickly, clinically, like\nEmerald but with a more refined sense of businesslike purpose. “Why are\nyou helping me?” he asked.\nIchtracia looked down at him as if the answer were obvious. She put a\nhand on his forehead, her gloves soft to the touch, and wiped the sweat\nfrom his brow in an almost gentle manner. “I’ll go to a lot of effort for a\nman who can make me laugh,” she said softly. “Besides, you asked me to\ndinner. I may be a Privileged, but I’m not a monster. I’ll never turn down a\nmeal with an interesting person.”\nAny further questions were cut off by the footman pressing a bottle to\nMichel’s mouth and pouring whiskey straight between his lips. He coughed,\nsputtered, trying to swallow as much as he could. The glass rim of the bottle\nwas quickly replaced by the sour taste of the footman’s belt being forced\nbetween his teeth.\nMichel went bug-eyed as he felt sorcery hold him so tightly he could\nbarely breathe. Ichtracia lifted a scalpel, examined it carefully, and then\nwent to work.\nWhat, Michel wondered as the cutting began, had he done to deserve\nthis?\nCHAPTER 40\nW\nhere are you going?”\nStyke looked up from packing Amrec’s saddlebags and saw Ibana\nwatching him from a few paces away, hands on her hips, eyes narrowed. He\nchecked to make sure a bottle of whiskey was safely wrapped in the\nrearmost saddlebag, then tightened the lashings to his bedroll. “I’ve got an\nerrand to run,” he said.\nIbana came around Amrec to stand beside him, looking concerned. For\nthree days they had followed in the shadow of the Third Army, drilling in\nthe mornings and evenings and tending to the wounded. They planned on\nheading back out on their own, first thing in the morning.\n“What’s this errand?”\nStyke hesitated. “It’s personal.”\n“It can’t wait?”\n“No. I’m just going a few miles.

I’ll be back before you’re ready to ride\nout in the morning.”\nIbana didn’t seem to buy it. “You’re not doing something stupid, are\nyou? You have more people to kill?”\n“Nope, nothing like that.”\nShe gazed at him suspiciously.\n“I swear,” he added.\n“Those dragonmen are still out there. Our scouts saw them the other day.\nIf you go off on your own, they’re going to kill you.”\n“That,” Styke said, “is why Celine and Ka-poel are staying with you.”\n“Neither of them will stand for it. Pit, I won’t stand for it. What are you\nup to, Ben? Why can’t you tell me?”\nStyke finished checking the saddle, then ran his hand along Amrec’s\nflank, up his neck, and over his nose. Amrec nuzzled him gently. “Like I\nsaid, it’s personal.”\n“Take an escort, at least.”\n“Not a chance. ‘Personal’ means not having fifty men with me. Besides,\nI’m more likely to lose those blasted dragonmen with just me and Amrec.”\nHe turned and fixed Ibana with a steady stare, waiting for her to continue\nthe argument. He wasn’t much for arguments and was satisfied to let her\nwin most of them. But this … this was important. “If Ka-poel tries to follow\nme, you truss her up and throw her over the back of a horse.”\n“Do it yourself,” Ibana snorted. “I’m not touching a blood sorcerer.”\n“Coward.”\n“Fool.”\nThey stared at each other for a moment; then Styke pulled himself up\ninto the saddle. “See you tomorrow morning.”\nHe rode northwest across the Third Army camp and headed through\ntheir pickets on the far side, where it was less likely that anyone trailing the\narmy would see him leave. About a mile out, he found a small river and\nrode down into the water, where he turned Amrec south.\n“This is going to be real uncomfortable for you for the next couple\nmiles,” he told Amrec, “but you’ll get carrots and sugar cubes when we\nmake camp.”\nThey stayed in the river for four hours, taking it slowly so that Amrec\ndidn’t slip. Styke hummed while his eyes scanned the riverbanks for Dynize\nscouts or dragonmen. He picked out familiar landmarks, dusting off hazy,\nlong-buried memories and forcing himself to dig among them.\nThe light was just beginning to wane, the river becoming more\ndangerous, when Styke caught sight of a particular bend and a narrow,\narrow-shaped boulder balanced on a knoll about twenty yards from the\nriver. He directed Amrec out of the bank and took him up to a nearby grove,\nwhere he used an old shirt to carefully dry Amrec’s hooves before leaving\nhim tied to a branch with a feed bag over his nose.\nStyke stood on the bank of the river for some time, watching the bats\nflutter overhead in the twilight and listening to the sound of crickets. He ran\nhis hands over his face, taking deep breaths of the humid air."

He ran\nhis hands over his face, taking deep breaths of the humid air.\nHe’d only ever been here three times in his life, but the place had a\nbiting familiarity that threatened to bring tears to his eyes. Everything about\nthe location was burned into his brain, from the mud of the riverbank to the\nmoss on the boulder to the sound the breeze made as it rattled the leaves of\nthe beech trees.\nTaking one last deep breath, he finally turned away from the river and\nwalked to the other side of the rock. He counted out thirty paces and found\na big, white-sided beech. Bending over, he felt along the trunk until he\nfound a set of deep grooves in the side. The letter “M,” carved by a boy\nseveral decades ago.\nStyke began to clear around the base of the beech, pulling away vines\nand slashing shrubs with his knife. It only took a few minutes to find the\nstone—a rectangular slab of white marble about the size of a bread box. He\nmethodically cleared around it, then off to one side, where he kindled a\nsmall fire that cast just enough light so that he could continue to work.\nSoon, the tiny grove was cleared of underbrush and the white marble\nscraped clean of thirty years of moss and grime. The edges were worn, the\nletters faded a little with time, but he could still make out the name\n“Marguerie ja Lind” and a set of dates. He knew what to expect, but he still\nlet out a small gasp when he saw them, squeezing his eyes closed against\nunbidden tears.\nHe sat on his haunches beside the stone—for how long, he was not sure.\nHe did not speak, or pray, or even think. His meditation was devoid of any\ndirection.\nAfter some time, he finally got to his feet and stoked the fire, laying out\nhis bedroll across from the grave and leaning up against the big beech tree\nwith the bottle of whiskey in one hand, a bag of sugar cubes in the other,\nand Amrec’s nose nuzzling his ear every so often as he slowly fed him the\ncubes.\nHe watched the embers float on the heat above the fire and listened to\nthe night noises until, sometime around midnight, they grew silent. Eyes\nclosed, head back, he drew his knife and lay it across his knee before taking\na swig of whiskey. Amrec snorted.\nWhen he opened his eyes again, he was not alone. The man standing\nbeside the grave was familiar. The sides of his head were meticulously\nshaved to leave a bright-red mohawk that was tied back in a knot over his\nleft ear. His face was sun-hardened, the freckles thick across the bridge of\nhis nose, black tattoos spiraling up his neck to touch his cheeks.\nThe dragonman did not look at Styke. He stared down at the gravestone,\nhis brow furrowed. His duster was pulled back to show a bone ax in his\nbelt, but he did not reach for it. In halting Palo, he asked, “Whose grave is\nthis?”\nStyke struggled to remember the dragonman’s name. He was sure he’d\nheard it during his encounter with the group back in Granalia. After a few"

After a few\nmoments it came to him: Ji-Orz.\n“It’s my mother’s,” Styke told him.\n“When did she die?”\nThe question was deeply personal, and Styke would normally have\nreacted violently to anyone asking after his mother. But somehow, here in\nthe darkness with another killer, it seemed like a natural thing to talk about.\n“When I was a boy.” He tried to remember the dates on the stone. It was\ntoo dark to see them. “Thirty-three years ago, I think.”\n“Disease?”\n“My father’s drunken rage.”\nJi-Orz’s frown deepened. “What fueled his rage?”\n“I don’t remember. Something trivial, probably. He killed my mother\nand he went after my baby sister.”\nJi-Orz glanced around, as if looking for another gravestone. Not seeing\none, he moved to the fire and hunkered down so that he, Styke, and the\ngrave created a three-pointed star around the flames. He stared at Styke,\neyes unblinking. “I wish to know what happened, if you’ll tell me.”\nThe oddness of speaking so freely to a man who’d come to kill him\nfinally caught up to Styke. He tapped a finger on the hilt of his knife.\n“Why?”\n“Because I like to collect stories of people I meet.”\n“People you kill?”\n“Sometimes. Not usually.” Ji-Orz gazed into the flames, a brief smile\ntouching his lips. “My mother told me stories, long ago. Before this.” He\ntapped the bone ax hanging from his belt. “Stories are all I have left of her.”\nStyke looked down at the bottle of whiskey. “My mother used to sing. I\ndon’t have anything left of hers, though. My sister might. I don’t know.” He\npaused, considering the dragonman’s previous question. “I murdered my\nfather before he could reach my sister.”\n“Good.” Ji-Orz nodded, as if patricide were a perfectly normal route.\n“That drunken piece of shit,” Styke continued, “rests in a mausoleum on\nthe old family property. It wasn’t right to put my mother in there with him,\nso I brought her here, where she grew up.” Styke nodded into the darkness.\n“She was born in a cabin about a hundred yards from here. Just a rotten ruin\nnow.” Styke laughed softly to himself, remembering. “I was just a kid.\nDidn’t even think to bring a shovel. I dug the grave with my hands.” He still\nhad tiny scars on his fingers where the rocky soil had cut them to ribbons.\nHe shook his head to dispel the memory, then took another swig of his\nwhiskey. He wondered who would move first—he or the dragonman—and\ncontemplated snatching up his knife. He looked at the gravestone, then at\nthe dragonman.\n“Are your friends sneaking up behind me?” Styke asked.\nJi-Orz shook his head. “We split up when we realized you were no\nlonger with the army. I believe I’m the only one who found your trail.”"

Ka-\nSedial’s people murdered my emperor and brokered a peace. I did not\naccept their emperor, so I was disgraced. I spent years in the darkest\ndungeons. Forgotten, until Ka-Sedial found a use for me.”\n“The six sent after me,” Styke asked, genuinely curious, “they’re all\ndisgraced?”\n“Ka-Sedial is vain, wrathful, and arrogant, but he is not stupid. He\nwould not waste six dragonmen on you—on a single person. But in the eyes\nof our people we no longer exist. He took the useless and found something\nfor us to do. If we bring him your head, we are allowed to be people again.”\nThere was a faraway look in Ji-Orz’s eyes, and Styke wondered if this\npromise of freedom made the dragonmen reckless, or whether it made them\nmore dangerous.\n“Why are you telling me this?”\nJi-Orz looked at the gravestone and sighed. “Because I want you to\nknow it’s not personal.”\n“War is rarely personal.”\n“War is always personal,” Ji-Orz said with an affronted expression. “The\nvery act of taking the life of another human being makes it so. But this time\nis not—” He stopped talking, clearly frustrated. “Perhaps I don’t get across\nmy meaning. Ka-Sedial has our blood. Do you know what this means?”\n“Vaguely.”\n“It means he can compel us, even across great distances. He can whisper\nin our ears and pry truths from our minds.”\n“That is … unsettling.”\n“It is rape,” Ji-Orz said flatly. “But Ka-Sedial is not perfect. He cannot\nwatch us all the time. And tonight … I will not fight a man on his mother’s\ngrave. I am a warrior, not a savage.”\nStyke wondered if this was all a ploy, if Ji-Orz said these things to get\nhim to lower his guard. There was an earnestness in his face as he struggled\nto find the right words that compelled Styke to believe him. Yet there was\nstill a doubt. He remembered Kushel’s willingness to hurt Celine back in\nLandfall, and half expected a knife to come out of the darkness and slash\nhis throat at any minute.\nIt did not arrive. Perhaps not all dragonmen were alike.\nSeveral minutes passed in silence. Sitting forward, Styke shook the half-\nempty bottle of whiskey and handed it across to Ji-Orz. The dragonman\nregarded it for a moment before taking a swig. He took another, wiped his\nchin on his sleeve, and handed it back. He stood up, straightening his duster\nto cover his weapons.\n“I will leave you to mourn, Ben Styke. Thank you for sharing your story"

Thank you for sharing your story\nwith me. The next time we meet, I will attempt to kill you. I will probably\nsucceed.” He put a notable emphasis on “probably.”\nThe dragonman bowed his head toward the gravestone and strode off\ninto the darkness, leaving Styke alone. His passage was purposefully loud,\nsticks crackling as he walked, as if to tell Styke that he had, indeed, gone.\nSoon the crickets returned, and Styke settled back to watch the flames.\nAmrec nibbled at his shoulder.\n“All out, boy,” Styke said, showing him his empty hand, letting Amrec\nexplore it with his velvety lips.\nStyke finished the bottle and lay awake, staring at the flames while he\nwaited for Ji-Orz’s wrathful return, or for one of the other dragonmen to\nhappen upon him. He did not remember closing his eyes, but when they\nopened once more, it was early in the morning. The fire was ash, his bedroll\nsoaked with morning dew. Styke stirred from his spot and took a walk\naround the grove, examining the ground for sign of the dragonman hiding\nout nearby. He couldn’t find any.\nHe finished clearing the last of the vines and brush from the grave and\nwalked to the old, rotted cabin where his mother was born, casting its now-\ncrumbled walls to memory. Returning to the grave, he bent to kiss the stone\nand then saddled Amrec. He left without looking back.\nThe column was already assembled to leave the Third Army by the time\nStyke returned. Ibana watched him arrive from horseback. Celine sat on her\nown horse nearby. Styke ignored Ibana and went to the girl first.\n“Why did you leave me?” Celine asked.\n“I had to do something alone,” Styke said.\n“I’ve seen you kill before.”\n“It’s not always about killing,” Styke explained softly. “I had to visit\nsomeone I love. Perhaps when this is over, I’ll take you to visit her as well.”\nCeline seemed to sense the solemnity of his words. She gave an\nuncertain nod. “Ka-poel is angry you left her behind. So is Ibana.”\n“They can both damn well deal with it.” He brushed her hair out of her\nface. “I should have taken you. I’m sorry. Next time I will.” With that, he\nheaded back to Ibana at the front of the column. He let her stare at the side\nof his face for several moments before letting out an irritated sigh. “Well?\nWe’ve got Dynize dragoons and a godstone to find. Let’s go hunting.”\nCHAPTER 41\nM\nichel stepped down from Ichtracia’s carriage, holding on carefully to\nthe door until his feet were on firm ground.

He looked up at the columned facade\nof the Landfall City Bank. It was an enormous building, over sixty feet tall\nwith foreboding gargoyles perched on the decorated eaves, all finished in\nblack marble. Last he heard, the bank had been ransacked and abandoned\nduring the invasion and had sat empty ever since.\nNow, though, half a dozen carriages sat out front, all of them bearing the\nblack and red curtains of the new regime. A Dynize flag hung from the\nhighest point of the roof, and he saw a steady stream of people coming and\ngoing. He couldn’t help but wonder if Ichtracia had fixed him up only to\nturn him over to Ka-Sedial to be tortured. He looked up at the driver of the\ncarriage, one of Ichtracia’s footmen. “Tculu,” he said, “why am I here?”\n“I just brought you to where I was told,” the footman responded. He\nsnapped the reins and drove off before Michel could question him further.\nTwo days locked up in Ichtracia’s townhouse. Two days without any\ninformation from the outside world. It was worse than when he’d been\nstuck in Emerald’s morgue, if only because he had no way of knowing who\nhad survived the blast that destroyed Yaret’s house, and whether he would\nemerge with any allies left among the Dynize. Other than Ichtracia, that\nwas, though Michel couldn’t consider her an ally. At best she was an\nenigma.\nAfter his healing, they had exchanged less than ten sentences. And now?\nHe was dumped outside the Landfall City Bank.\n“Michel!”\nMichel turned to find Tenik walking toward him from beyond one of the\ncarriages. He couldn’t help a smile, a wave of relief sweeping across him at\nthe sight of a familiar face. “Tenik, I’m glad to see you alive.”\n“Perhaps,” Tenik responded in a somber tone. “Come with me.”\n“What do you mean, perhaps?” Michel asked. Tenik didn’t answer,\nturning sharply and striding away with a purpose that was incongruous with\nthe laid-back man Michel had gotten to know. Michel was surprised at the\nbrusqueness, and he slowly followed Tenik up the steps of the old bank and\nthrough the enormous front doors. Despite Michel’s obvious discomfort,\nTenik neither offered a hand nor slowed his pace. Inside, the cavernous\nmain hall was a whirl of activity—men, women, and children seemed to fill\nmost of the space and a vaguely organized sort of indoor camp, with tents\nand partitions splitting the room into thirty or forty smaller ones.\nTenik navigated the space with ease, and Michel had a difficult time\nkeeping up. He paused in the center of things for a breather, only to look up\nand see Tenik waiting ahead, watching him with a cold stare that put Michel\non edge.\nThey continued to the back of the great room and up two flights of steps\nto the bank manager’s offices.

Michel felt their eyes turn on him instantly, and he shifted\nuncomfortably, wondering what he had walked into. There was something\nvery wrong here, and it took him far too long to figure it out.\nThe realization hit him just as the door opened and Tenik reappeared:\nEveryone here thought that Michel was responsible for Yaret’s death. He\nfelt a trickle of sweat roll down the small of his back, and the behavior of\nTenik—and the angry stares of the guards—now made so much more sense.\nThis bank was the Household’s staging point, where they’d all gathered to\nrecover. Michel was the man responsible for this, or so they all thought, and\nhe had little doubt who’d spread that rumor.\nTenik stood in the open doorway for a moment, his expression troubled,\nobviously trying to read Michel. For his part, Michel could do little more\nthan sweat openly, knowing how pale and frail he looked. He knew what\nguilt looked like, and it wasn’t all that different from a man trying to keep\nhimself together when he is physically and emotionally empty.\n“All right,” Tenik said, “come in.”\nMichel stepped through the door and into the bank manager’s offices,\nwhich he could tell in a single glance had been co-opted by whoever was\ntaking over Yaret’s position as the head of the Household. Michel wondered\nbriefly how the line of succession affected the Name, and if Yaret would\nfade into obscurity, forgotten by all but a few dusty history books.\nIt was with some surprise that he entered a second doorway and found\nYaret himself sitting behind the manager’s old desk, leaning forward,\nfingers steepled, brow furrowed as one of his cupbearers spoke earnestly. At\nthe sight of Michel, Yaret raised his hand, and the woman beside him fell\nsilent.\nThere were four other people in the room besides Michel, Tenik, and\nYaret. Michel recognized each of them as Yaret’s top lieutenants. He tried to\nfigure out who was missing and couldn’t come up with anyone. Had none\nof them died in the bombing? His pleasure at the news—and the sight of\nYaret alive and well—was tempered by the fact that everyone in the room\nlooked at him with the same weighing, anger-tinged way the guards outside\nhad. He was, he realized in an instant, on trial.\n“Michel,” Yaret said by way of greeting. “We’re all rather surprised to\nsee you alive.”\nMichel was about to answer that the feeling was mutual, but realized\nhow bad that would sound before the words left his mouth. Instead, he just\nnodded. “I have the feeling I’ve missed a lot.”\n“Indeed. There are quite a lot of rumors swirling around about you right\nnow.”\nMichel glanced at Tenik, but the cupbearer was clearly going to be of no\nhelp. He felt a spark of anger and grabbed on to it, using it to prop himself\nup in the face of silent accusations. He didn’t know exactly what was going\non, but he had a pretty good guess.

He’d almost killed himself just\nattempting to warn them of the bombing, and here they were turned against\nhim. “I’m going to guess that those rumors include my involvement with\nthe bombing of your Household.”\n“Do you deny them?” Yaret asked.\nMichel glanced around at the hostile faces. He’d begun to think of these\npeople as his colleagues, Tenik even as a friend. He didn’t deserve this. He\nwas too tired, in too much pain. “Of course I deny it. You want an\nexplanation for my absence the last week? Here it is.” He launched into a\nquick summary of his adventures, starting with his search of Forgula’s\nhouse, then his shooting by Hendres, and his recovery with Emerald. He\nfinished with his attempt to warn Yaret about the bombing, and his time\nspent locked in Ichtracia’s townhouse. He glossed over a few key details,\nlike Emerald’s name and occupation, but kept everything fairly true to\nreality.\nYaret and his people listened without interrupting, watching him\ncarefully throughout the whole story. Michel ended with a sigh and, without\nbeing invited, took an empty chair from the corner of the room and dragged\nit over in front of Yaret’s desk before collapsing into it.\n“Ichtracia saved you from Forgula?” Yaret asked.\nIt was not the first question Michel expected to be asked. “She did. I\nhave no idea why.”\n“She’s taken a liking to him,” Tenik interrupted, clearing his throat. “She\nhas ever since Michel tagged Forgula at the war games.”\nYaret snorted, burying a half smile, the closest thing to humor to enter\nthis room since Michel’s arrival. “No telling what’s in a Privileged’s head.\nEspecially that one.” He squinted at Michel, then suddenly produced a\npiece of paper. It was hastily scrawled with the words Evacuate Household.\nBomb.—Michel. He set it in the middle of the desk so that Michel could see\nit. “That,” he said, “is the only reason you’re standing there right now, and\nnot already handed over to the bone-eyes for questioning. Because of this\nnote, we were able to get everyone out of the townhouse in Chancellor’s\nCourt before several barrels of gunpowder were detonated in the basement.\nThe house was destroyed. The Household was saved.”\nThere was a note of gratitude in Yaret’s voice that made Michel’s heart\nsing. He reined in his elation. This was still a trial, and it could still go bad.\nYaret continued. “Forgula has openly accused you of being responsible\nfor the bombings that have taken place across the city. She and several\nwitnesses claim you were present just before the destruction of my house.\nFrom your explanation—and from this note here and the witness of the\nchild who brought it to me—you were attempting to warn us.”\n“I was.”\n“Good. Then I think we both see what Forgula is up to. Without\nevidence, though, Sedial will demand that I hand you over to the bone-eyes\nfor questioning.”\nMichel glanced between the faces.

He took a deep breath. “I’m sorry, sir, but I don’t think you\ndo understand what Forgula is up to.”\n“Oh?”\nMichel produced the list of addresses that he had taken from Forgula’s\nhouse. The paper was stained black with his blood. He handed it to Tenik,\nwho examined it with a frown. “That,” Michel said, “is what I found among\nForgula’s papers. It struck me as important at the time, so I confiscated it,\nbut I was shot before I could give it a second thought. In my weakened\nstate, I didn’t grasp the significance of the addresses until the morning of\nthe bombing, and that’s when I attempted to reach the house to warn you.”\n“What is that?” Yaret asked Tenik.\nTenik’s eyebrows rose. “It’s a list of addresses—corresponding to every\nsingle one of the bombings, including the one that destroyed our house.”\n“You’ll find that the handwriting matches the writing in Forgula’s\npocketbook,” Michel said, trying not to sound smug.\nThree of Yaret’s lieutenants began to mutter. A fourth gasped openly.\nYaret stilled them with a raised hand. “And?”\n“I propose that Forgula has been working with Marhoush and the\nBlackhats. She struck a deal with them to kill as many of Sedial’s enemies\nas they could. I have no idea what the Blackhats are getting in return, but\nit’s clear from that list of addresses that she knew ahead of time where they\nwould occur. I’d be willing to bet that Marhoush or je Tura has a matching\nlist.”\nYaret nodded at Tenik, who slipped out of the room without a word.\nMichel opened his mouth to ask where Tenik was going, but Yaret cut him\noff. “You’re accusing Ka-Sedial of treason.”\n“I am,” Michel said. “Forgula ran the errands, but it’s too convenient of\na pattern for Sedial not to have given the order.”\n“Would he dare?” one of the lieutenants asked.\nYaret tapped a finger against his chin, staring over Michel’s shoulder at\nnothing, a scowl etched on his face. “Sedial has dared an awful lot. He\nwould never risk the empire—if all of this is true, he probably has a plan to\neliminate the Blackhats as soon as they’ve served their purpose. But he has\nnever been above destroying his enemies.”\n“All of that was supposed to change with this war. We were supposed to\nbe united,” another of the lieutenants growled.\nYaret didn’t answer him. Somewhere in the bank, Michel thought he\nheard a scream. He tried to ignore it. He was completely certain of this\nconspiracy now. It made too much sense, and it was clear from Yaret’s body\nlanguage that he wouldn’t be hard to convince.

When the quiet had\nalmost become unbearable, the door opened and Tenik returned just as\nsuddenly as he left. He held a leather pocketbook—Forgula’s—in one hand.\nHe plucked the bloodstained address list off the table and compared the\ntwo, then nodded. “The handwriting is a match.”\n“And Marhoush?” Yaret asked.\n“He’s changed his story.”\nMichel perked up at this. “Marhoush is here?”\n“You can tell him,” Yaret said to Tenik.\nTenik nodded, then turned to Michel. “We brought Marhoush in the\nevening after the bombing and handed him over to our own Household\nquestioners. His story has corroborated the story Forgula told us—that you\nare still a loyal Blackhat, spying on the Dynize—but I just went to him with\nthe story you told us and he broke down. He said that Forgula has been\nfunneling the Blackhats supplies in exchange for conducting bombings at\nthe addresses and dates she gave him. He even told me where to find a copy\nof that list you brought us.”\nMichel allowed himself to close his eyes and let out a sigh of relief.\nWhen he looked up, Yaret was smiling at him thoughtfully. “I’m glad\nyou’re still one of us,” Yaret said.\nMichel swallowed his guilt, pushing his real self deeper into the back of\nhis head. “I’m glad I had evidence that Forgula is a lying sack of shit. What\ndo we do now? Is this enough evidence to accuse Sedial?”\n“I think it is,” Yaret replied.\nTenik raised his eyebrows. “That will be dangerous.”\n“Dangerous or not,” Yaret said with a shake of his head, “Sedial must be\nbrought to heel.”\nMichel was hit with a sudden sense of foreboding. “Perhaps Tenik is\nright,” he said.\n“In what way?”\n“That it’s damned dangerous. Too dangerous. Sedial is the emperor’s\nman, right? And he commands the armies and the Privileged? If we go after\nhim openly—if we force him into the light—he may just crush us\nunderfoot. It would be his only option.”\n“He tried to kill me,” Yaret said quietly. “He tried to kill my Household.\nI will not let this stand.”\n“We won’t,” Michel assured him. “But I think I know of a way we can\npunish him without forcing a more deadly confrontation.”\n“I’m listening.”\nMichel took a deep breath. This idea would lessen the ugliness, but it\nwould also make Michel another very powerful enemy. “When is the next\npublic event where both Sedial and Forgula will be present?”\nCHAPTER 42\nV\nlora did as she’d promised Taniel and changed hotels.

The Vale was approached by a\nsteep hill on the northern edge of town and entered through a narrow valley\nbetween two great pillars of stone. Because the Vale was entirely the\nproperty of Jezzy’s Shovel gang, the valley was closed to outsiders and\nguarded by eight armed men at all times.\nVlora watched them for two days and nights, attempting to find some\nkind of chink in their routine that would let her slip into the Vale and back\nout again without being noticed. She grew more and more frustrated at the\nsituation—the approach was out in the open, the guards were rotated in\nshifts without a gap, and every wagon that entered and left the Vale was\nguarded to and from the destination. According to a few old prospectors she\nasked, climbing around the other side of the Vale would take her four or\nfive days.\nShe began to wonder if maybe Jezzy was in on the recovery of the stone\n—or if it was just that gold mines were more thoroughly guarded than some\nmilitary armories. Bad luck either way.\nOn the third day she picked up a copy of the Yellow Creek Caller to find\na surprising bit of information on the front page. The headline read\nMERCENARY ARMY MARCHES ON YELLOW CREEK. Below was a snappy story on\nthe Riflejacks that said they were spotted in the region marching toward\nYellow Creek. She returned to the newsie boy who’d sold her the paper and\npointed at the headline. “Is this from this morning?”\n“Yes, ma’am. Fresh information.”\n“Do you know anything else about this?” she asked.\n“I don’t think so.”\nVlora fished a coin from her pocket and flicked it off her thumb. The\nboy caught it, looked over his shoulder, and took two steps closer. He spoke\nin a conspiratorial tone.\n“Rumor has it the big bosses are frantic with worry. Each of them thinks\nthe other hired a whole mercenary army to take their gold, and both of them\nare denying it. I heard that it was Jezzy who hired them. Supposedly the\narmy’s led by that Flint lady—you know, the one that the Lady Chancellor\nhas put a bounty on?”\n“I’ve heard of her,” Vlora said cautiously.\n“Well, everyone is arming up to protect their claims. The big bosses are\nforcing a production increase and offering huge amounts to anyone who\ncarries a weapon. The guards are doubling. The mayor wants to close all the\nroads, but Jezzy and Brown Bear Burt want to keep them open to get their\ngold out. They say it’s chaos in the mayor’s office, and no one knows what\nto do.”\nVlora left the newsie with an extra coin and strode off swearing under\nher breath. This was exactly why she’d come ahead of the army—exactly\nwhy she’d given herself an extra couple of weeks to try to find the stone\nbefore they were forced to bring in a few thousand soldiers and dig it up\nwith violence. She originally thought that the town’s defenses would be\nlittle more than an inconvenience, but now she wasn’t so sure.

Roadblocks\nin the harsh terrain could keep the Riflejacks from approaching the city for\ndays or weeks, and when they finally arrived, they would have to deal with\nstreet-to-street fighting with people who thought they were there to steal the\ngold.\nVlora headed to the main street and checked in with the messenger\nservice that she’d used to try to find Olem. The man behind the desk\nrecognized her immediately and went to a locked box in the corner of the\nroom, returning a moment later with a letter.\n“It came yesterday,” the clerk said apologetically. “We checked with\nyour hotel, but they said you had left and not given them a forwarding\naddress.”\nVlora tipped the man and took the letter to the corner. She recognized\nOlem’s writing immediately.\nProgress has been slow. Took a circuitous route to approach from the\neast. News from Landfall. We are five days out. I fear word has gone ahead\nof us. Expect panic. We will hold at six miles and wait for orders.\n“A little damned late,” she said, lighting the edge of the letter with a\nmatch and letting it burn down to her fingertips. She did some quick mental\nmath and decided that they were probably getting close to that six miles.\nMaking camp six miles out could be good, though—it would give the city\nresidents longer to worry about why they were here and who had hired\nthem, which in turn would give Vlora more time to find the stone.\nIf the Picks and Shovels began fighting among themselves, the\nRiflejacks might have an easier time of mopping things up.\nBut none of this, she decided, was ideal.\nCHAPTER 43\nM\nichel sat in the hallway outside of the war game arena in the capitol\nbuilding, listening as the cheering came to a great crescendo before tapering\noff into the general cacophony of loud conversation that he normally\nassociated with the period at the end of a boxing match. He wondered\nbriefly who won, before reminding himself that he didn’t know who either\nof the players were, or most of the rules of the game.\nMaybe if he stuck around here long enough, he would learn how to play.\nMichel took a coin out of his pocket. He flipped it, caught it, and looked\nat the result. How, he wondered, did Tenik resist looking at that result every\ntime? It was a natural human urge, wasn’t it? To know how something\nended?\nBefore Michel could ponder the question further, the doors opened and a\nstream of people began to pass him. No one seemed to really notice his\npresence, which, he decided, was probably for the best. He recognized most\nof the people either from the game he had attended the other week with\nTenik or from figures he’d seen stalking these very halls over the last\ncouple of weeks. The cream of the Dynize crop.

He reminded\nhimself that he had made plenty of accusations before. This was just far\nmore public than he was used to. He would just have to get used to it.\n“Forgula,” he called sharply.\nThe people closest to him stopped in their tracks and turned, some of\nthem doing a double take as they saw him. Forgula, her head bowed to\nlisten to the words of a woman beside her, searched for the source of the\nsummons until her eyes met his. All around her, the stream of people\ngradually ground to a halt.\nHer lip curled slightly, but she bowed her head again and nodded to the\nman to go on, turning a cold shoulder toward Michel.\n“You probably shouldn’t enjoy this,” Michel whispered to himself,\nstifling a smile. “Devin-Forgula a Sedial!” he barked.\nEveryone had stopped by now. People were looking curiously between\nMichel and Forgula, the latter of whom finally pulled herself away from her\ncompanion and strode through the crowd toward Michel. She came up\nsharply, chin raised, glaring down her nose at him. “Shouldn’t you be in a\ncell, spy?”\n“Not me,” Michel said, tapping the front of his jacket. She looked down,\nseeing the way he was dressed for the first time—a teal uniform, worn by\nministerial servants on official business. It was similar to a Dynize soldier’s\noutfit, though the cut of the pants was slightly different. This one had been\ntailored specifically for Michel just yesterday and it fit him rather\nsplendidly. The jacket bore the crest scroll of Yaret’s Household, and\nbeneath that a small stitched cup.\n“Why are you wearing that uniform?” Forgula demanded. She scowled\nat him, and he could see the first inkling in her eye that she knew something\nwas off. “You have no right.”\n“I have a lot of right,” Michel responded. “I saved the Yaret Household\nfrom a bombing. Hadn’t you heard?” Michel knew for a fact that she hadn’t\nheard. The last time she saw him, he was being carted off by Ichtracia just\nbefore the bombing. At his request, everything about his activities the last\nfew days had been kept quiet. As far as anyone knew, Yaret had barely\nescaped the bombing because of an anonymous tip, and the Blackhat spy\nMichel Bravis was in Yaret’s custody and being questioned.\n“You didn’t save them,” Forgula said. She was uneasy now, lacking\nconviction. This had taken her completely by surprise.\nDon’t smile, Michel. “I did, actually. You remember that day, don’t you?\nIt was just earlier this week. You and your cronies tried to chase me down,\neven though I could barely walk. It’s all right, though. Fortune smiled on\nme, and I still managed to warn Yaret about the bomb.”\n“You could only know about that bomb if you were the one to plant it.”\nEveryone was watching now, as if glued to the floor.

        "text": "“You could only know about that bomb if you were the one to plant it.”\nEveryone was watching now, as if glued to the floor. There wasn’t a\nsound within forty feet as people strained to hear the conversation. Michel\nwas using his best Dynize, though he had to throw in a Palo word once in a\nwhile. He was certain that everyone was getting the gist. “Or,” Michel said,\n“if I found this.” He drew out the list of addresses he had stolen from her\nfiles. It was fragile from being caked with his dry blood, so he presented it\nto her in a stiff folder. She reached for it involuntarily, and he snatched it\naway. “This,” Michel said, “is a list of addresses that includes—”\n“I know what that is,” Forgula hissed, glancing desperately at the crowd\naround her.\nMichel went on in a louder voice. “It’s a list of addresses that includes\nevery location that has been attacked since the bombings started. It was\nfound among your files last week, and is written in your—”\n“Shut up!” Forgula said, grabbing Michel by the wrist.\n“Unhand me,” Michel responded coldly.\n“Give me that.” Before he could stop her, Forgula snatched the folder\nout of his hand and opened it up, staring at the list of addresses. There was a\nrustling nearby, and several soldiers took up positions along the edges of the\nhall, watching Forgula carefully. Michel almost wanted her to run, just to\nsee what would happen. Yaret had ordered his men to be emphatic if\nnecessary.\nMichel took a half step toward her and lowered his voice so that only\nshe could hear. “The thing is, if you’re going to spread a rumor that I was\nshot by a Blackhat, you should consider the fact that there were no other\nwitnesses besides me and the shooter—and you didn’t hear about it from\nme. Also, having me shot by a Blackhat contradicts your story that I’m still\nworking for them. Never cross your narratives and”—he tapped the folder\nin her hands—“never keep a copy of addresses where you intend to have\npeople killed.”\nTo Michel’s left, a door opened and Tenik emerged with four more\nsoldiers, taking up a position close enough to snatch Forgula if she\nattempted to attack him.\nThere was a sudden commotion, and then three emphatic clicks on the\nmarble flooring. A corridor opened in the throng of people to reveal Ka-\nSedial standing just inside the war game arena, a scowl on his face, quietly\ndemanding to know what was going on. When his eyes fell on Michel and\nForgula, he immediately began to stride toward them, cane in hand.\nIchtracia stood just behind him, following with a curious look on her face.\nMichel swallowed his nerves and glanced at Tenik, who gave an almost\nimperceptible nod. Waiting until Sedial was almost upon them, right as the\nKa’s mouth opened with a demand, Michel gave a quick, respectful bow\nand spoke first. “Great Ka, thank you for coming. We have a grave matter to\nbring to your attention.”\nKa-Sedial glanced from Forgula to Michel to Tenik, the irritation on his\nface fading to something more neutral in the space of an instant.

        "text": "bring to your attention.”\nKa-Sedial glanced from Forgula to Michel to Tenik, the irritation on his\nface fading to something more neutral in the space of an instant. The old\nbastard knew a trap when he saw one, and he would wait to see how this\nplayed out before publicly castigating Michel.\nWhich was all Michel needed.\n“What matter is at hand?” Sedial asked.\nMichel bowed again. “By order of Yaret, we have come to arrest Devin-\nForgula on charges of murder and treason.” He half expected Sedial to bark\na reply—to sweep in to cover for his cupbearer. Instead, the old man simply\nlifted his chin and narrowed his eyes as if to say, Continue. So Michel did.\n“We have evidence that Devin-Forgula has conspired with enemies of the\nstate in order to kill off her rivals among the Dynize.” Michel so very much\nwanted to say “your rivals,” but he kept to his script. This had to fall on\nForgula’s shoulders, and hers alone. “The bombings conducted by the\nBlackhats over the last few weeks were coordinated by Forgula.”\n“You have no evidence,” Forgula said, finally finding her tongue. She\nsnatched up the list of addresses and crumpled it, throwing it at Michel’s\nface. “Just a damned bloody piece of paper.”\nMichel let the paper bounce off his cheek without comment. “We do,\nactually. We have a second copy of that paper found among the effects of a\ncaptured Blackhat. We also have the word of that Blackhat that you worked\nwith him directly. And that, Great Ka, is why Yaret has asked for your\nassistance. We formally request a bone-eye inquisition of the Blackhat\nprisoner in question, followed by an inquisition into Forgula herself. We\nwant to gain nothing but the truth, and we request that you aid us in that\nprocess.”\nTo his credit, Sedial didn’t even blink at the request. He remained silent\nfor several moments, no doubt fully aware that the eyes of the Dynize upper\ncrust were on him. He looked coolly at Forgula, then at Michel. “Of\ncourse,” he said.\nForgula gave an anguished cry, lurching forward and snatching the\nsword from the Dynize soldier at Tenik’s side.\n“Stop her!” Michel cried.\nForgula leapt back, waving the sword once and looking Sedial in the\nface before taking it by the blade and pressing the tip to her chest and\nfalling upon it. Her sobbing was cut short, body spasming as her weight\ncaused the blade to pierce her heart. She slumped, then fell to one side with\na thump, a pool of blood immediately beginning to widen around her.\nSeveral of the crowd gasped. People attempted to step away from the\nblood. Ka-Sedial did not, so Michel didn’t, either.\n“I’m sorry, Great Ka,” Michel said gently in the silence. “That was not\nat all how we wanted this to go.” It was exactly how they wanted it to go.\nAnd just for an instant, when he raised his face from the gruesome\ndisplay, Michel could see raw fury in Ka-Sedial’s eyes.

Sedial knew this\nwas what was meant to happen, and he knew that the message sent by this\nevent came directly from Yaret—despite Yaret’s absence. The fury was\ngone in the blink of an eye, replaced by the sad resolve of an old man. Ka-\nSedial shook his head, tutting, before raising his voice.\n“May Devin-Forgula’s body be fed to the dogs,” Sedial proclaimed,\n“and her name be forever struck from the records of the Sedial Household.\nMay she be crushed and forgotten. Such is the fate of a traitor.” His eyes\nlanded on Michel’s face on that final word, and Michel suppressed a\nshudder. He would not get out of this unscathed.\n“That,” he said quietly, “will not happen. Forgula will be remembered\nfor what she was, and her crime publicized and recorded. Her name will be\nstruck from your Household records, but not the public ones.”\nSedial’s eyes narrowed. “I make those decisions.”\n“I apologize, Great Ka, but you do not. The Ministry of Scrolls does.”\n“I see.” Sedial settled both hands on his cane, shoulders slumped as if he\nwas a man under a great weight, and gazed into Michel’s eyes in an almost\nplacid manner for a few moments before hobbling off. The crowd gave way\nbefore him, and Michel watched as he tracked Forgula’s blood down the\nhall without seeming to care. Michel wondered if that was a metaphor for\nKa-Sedial’s whole career, and decided not to pursue the thought any further.\nSlowly, the crowd began to move again. Conversation resumed, and\npeople stopped staring at Michel or the body at his feet. A pair of soldiers\napproached, checking Forgula for any sign of life before lifting her by the\nhands and feet and carrying her off.\n“That was well done,” Tenik said.\nMichel let out a long breath. He dragged his sleeve across his brow and\ndabbed the sweat off the back of his neck. “Pit, I never want to do that\nagain.”\n“That’s too bad. You did it well enough that Yaret might use you again in\nthe future.”\n“I’m a spy, damn it. Not a constable.”\nTenik tapped the cup insignia on Michel’s uniform. “You’re whatever\nYaret needs you to be, cupbearer.”\n“Don’t remind me.”\nTenik gave him a small smile. “I will, and frequently. You still have a lot\nto learn.”\n“Don’t I know it.”\n“Have we gotten anything from Marhoush?”\n“The names of a half-dozen more safe houses and perhaps thirty\nBlackhats,” Tenik answered.\n“Do we know where je Tura is?”\n“Marhoush has no idea. He thinks that je Tura uses the catacombs\nbeneath the city to get around, but we’ve searched dozens of miles of that\ndamned spiderweb and found little evidence of a giant network of Blackhat\npowder monkeys.”\nMichel growled in the back of his throat, frustrated. With Marhoush\nhanded over to the bone-eyes, there would be no secrets left to learn—and\nhe was their best chance of finding je Tura. “Keep looking. Send more men"

Send more men\ninto the catacombs if you have to.” He suddenly became aware that he and\nTenik were not isolated in their conversation. He glanced over his shoulder\nto find Ichtracia leaning against the wall a few feet behind him, just out of\nthe pool of Forgula’s blood, watching him with a tight-lipped smile.\n“I’ll see to the body,” Tenik suddenly said.\n“Tenik, wait, I—” Tenik was gone before Michel could stop him,\nleaving him alone with Ichtracia. He turned, putting on his most charming\nsmile. “Good evening, Saen-Ichtracia.”\n“Good evening, Devin-Michel a Yaret.”\nMichel felt goose bumps on the backs of his arms at the title. His smile\nfaltered for a split second, but he didn’t think Ichtracia noticed. “I’m sorry\nfor the mess,” he said.\n“I’m not the one standing in it,” Ichtracia said with a shrug.\nMichel looked down to realize that he was, indeed, standing in Forgula’s\nblood. He lifted one foot, looked around for somewhere to wipe it, then\ngave up. “What can I do for you, Saen?”\n“I’m curious; did Sedial put her up to it?” Ichtracia nodded to where\nForgula’s body had been a minute before.\n“Of course not. She acted alone, against her enemies.”\n“You mean the enemies of the Sedial Household. I’m not stupid, Michel,\nand I know who died in those explosions. None were allies of Sedial.”\nMichel licked his lips, glancing over his shoulder. The crowd had gotten\nout quickly, and he imagined that in a few minutes no one would be left but\nwhatever poor sod of a soldier was tasked with cleaning up this blood. Most\nof the crowd had deftly avoided the pool, but the blood Ka-Sedial tracked\ndown the hallway was smeared everywhere.\n“Was it that obvious?” he asked.\n“It will be after the gossip has gone around the city a few times,”\nIchtracia answered. “You showed everyone the math, after all.”\n“Good.”\nIchtracia’s eyebrows went up in surprise; then she smiled. “Oh, I see.\nVery clever. You want everyone to know that Sedial has broken the Dynize\ntruce without actually calling him out in public. It erodes his power base\nwithout forcing him to respond immediately. Tell me, was this Yaret’s idea\nor yours?”\nMichel shook his head.\n“Oh, I’ll bet it was yours. Yaret is a very intelligent man, but he’s not\nmuch of a schemer. You, however …” Ichtracia stepped over to Michel,\nputting her face just inches from Michel’s to look him in the eyes. She was\nshorter than he by over two inches, but he felt as if she were staring down at\nhim.\nMichel cleared his throat. “I want to thank you again for saving my life.”\n“And how are you feeling?”\n“Not fantastic.

I suggest that you deliver on that dinner you offered me.”\n“I’m, uh, afraid that my favorite restaurant burned down during the\nriots.” Michel thought that his mouth should be dry, his heart hammering,\nbut to his surprise he found that he was calmer now than he had been ten\nminutes ago. Why would that be? Flirting with a Privileged was infinitely\nmore dangerous than arresting an enemy of the state.\nBut, he realized, it was also more private. More intimate. This was what\nhe knew how to do. A memory suddenly leapt to his mind, of watching his\nmother’s cat play with a mouse for several days. When asked, his mother\ntold him that the mouse was the safest critter on the block for as long as the\ncat found it entertaining.\n“Your excuse fails to impress me,” Ichtracia noted.\n“Perhaps you have a chef at your townhouse?” Michel asked. Yaret was\na fine master, but Michel had seen the fury in Sedial’s eyes. He needed\nsomeone who could protect him right now.\nIchtracia cocked an eyebrow. She opened her mouth, closed it, then\ngrinned. “I think you’ll be a lot of fun.”\nSaid the cat to the mouse, Michel thought. He linked arms with\nIchtracia, falling in beside her. “Come, we must find somewhere to clean\nthe blood from my shoes and pants.”\nCHAPTER 44\nT\nhe Dynize dragoons appeared within hours of the Mad Lancers leaving\nthe safety of the Third Army and harassed them all along the length of the\nHammer for two more days. On the third, Styke called for a rest at midday\nand sent for his officers.\n“Why are they riding my ass so hard?” Styke asked Ka-poel as he\nwaited for his men to gather. Through his looking glass he watched a\nDynize scout, wearing the now-familiar turquoise jacket and black pants of\nthe Dynize dragoons. The scout was about three miles away and, from the\nway he was standing out in the open, clearly wanted to be seen. The Dynize\nwere trying to get under his skin.\nThey were succeeding.\n“Eh?” he asked, lowering his glass. “Why do they dog me? Did that\nprick of a Dynize commander order them after me as well?”\nKa-poel remained intractable, her face a mask of mild irritation, though\nwhether that was directed at Styke, at the Dynize, or at their slow progress\nacross the Hammer, he couldn’t be sure. She finally shook her head. I don’t\nknow.\nStyke made a vexed sound in the back of his throat. He’d been hunted\nplenty of times—the Kez had sent a whole field army after the Mad Lancers\nat one point during the war—but he’d never been ambushed so successfully\nas by these dragoons, nor followed so closely without his own scouts\nknowing exactly where the enemy was at all times.\nHe was struck by a thought that brought a smile to his lips. It was not\nthat funny, but he soon found himself roaring, slapping his knee, bent\ndouble.

When he was finally able to stand, he turned to find Ka-poel’s\nfacade broken and an expression on her face that clearly asked, What the pit\nis wrong with you?\n“Ka-Sedial,” he said, wiping a tear from his eye. “He must have been so\nincredibly pissed that someone crushed one of his dragonmen. When he\nfound out I was a cripple … I can just imagine his face!” He made Ka-poel\nsuffer through another round of chuckles, then gasped for breath.\nKa-poel smirked.\n“I should write him a letter,” Styke said. “Tell him that I killed another\none. And that a third had her head blown off by a little girl!”\nHis mirth was interrupted by the arrival of Ibana and Jackal. Ibana had a\nfresh cut across her cheek from where a Dynize bullet had barely missed\nher face in a sortie less than three hours ago. They’d lost seven Mad\nLancers and only managed to down two of the Dynize, and she was clearly\nnot in a smiling mood.\n“What’s so funny?” she demanded.\nStyke waved it off and forced himself to sober. “Nothing, nothing.\nJackal, have you managed to wrangle any of your damned spirits so we can\nfind out when and where these sons of bitches are going to hit us next?”\n“I have, actually.”\nBoth Ibana and Gustar adopted dubious expressions. Styke held a finger\nout to them. “Only interrupt if you have any better ideas,” he said. They\nboth remained silent, and he pointed to Jackal.\n“There is one,” Jackal said. “She was an officer until Ibana killed her\ntwo days ago—their equivalent of a lieutenant. She does not fear Ka-poel\nlike the others.”\nKa-poel seemed mildly intrigued by this. Styke asked, “Why not?”\n“She will not say and I can’t coax it out of her. From what she tells me,\nthe Dynize are not …” He paused as if trying to come up with the right\nphrase. “They are not of one mind.”\n“Divided?” Styke asked. Ji-Orz had said as much, but it was interesting\nto have this confirmed by Jackal.\n“They spent the better part of the last century locked in a bitter civil war.\nThere were ultimately two sides and dozens of factions in each. She was a\nmember of the side that eventually capitulated. She does not believe in Ka-\nSedial’s plan to unite the country by invading Fatrasta, and she did not want\nto be here in the first place.”\n“And that’s why she’s talking to you?”\n“That, and she thinks her commanding officer is an asshole.”\nStyke wondered briefly if this whole conversation was more evidence\nthat he had come unhinged. If someone had claimed to speak with spirits\nback during the old war, he would have sent them to the front of the next\ncharge and hoped they either became a spirit themselves or got the sense\nknocked into them. “I like her,” Styke said, referring to the spirit. “Does she\nknow why they’re after us?”\n“That’s not important,” Ibana cut in. “Does she know what their plan\nis?” She gritted her teeth, and Styke could tell it annoyed her to ask Jackal a\nquestion for the spirits.

Major Gustar remained silent, still looking\nskeptical.\n“Their plan is to wear us thin,” Jackal said. “They tried engaging us\ndirectly and lost more men than they’d expected. They will harass us until\nwe reach the coast and then try to break us.” He paused. “It seems they are\nnot an ordinary cavalry unit.”\n“I could have told you that,” Styke snorted.\n“At the end of the civil war, they were the other emperor’s bodyguard.\nOr rather, they are what’s left of his bodyguard.”\n“I’m being chased by four dragonmen and a damned imperial guard,”\nStyke murmured to himself. “Ka-Sedial needs to learn to let things go.” He\ncleared his throat. “How far are we from the end of the Hammer?”\nGustar spoke up. “A few days at our current rate.”\nStyke mused over the possibilities. “We could just ignore them until we\nreach the coast and they’re forced to engage us.”\n“They’ll bleed us dry,” Gustar said. “We’re down to less than six\nhundred able-bodied men. We could lose another two hundred in those\ndays. My guess is they still have fifteen hundred left. That would leave us\noutnumbered nearly four-to-one.”\n“We’ve faced worse odds,” Styke said.\nIbana put her hands on her hips. “I’ll remind you again: We had\nenchanted armor. Not everyone is able to walk off every engagement they\nend up in, Ben.”\nStyke frowned, considering his cavalier attitude toward the deaths of\nothers. He knew commanding officers whose hearts bled for every death\nunder their command—Lady Flint was one of those. To some that was a\nweakness. Flint had turned it into a strength.\nHe turned his gaze to the west—toward the end of the Hammer and, if\nKa-poel was to believed, their final destination. He wondered briefly at\ntheir end goal in regard to the godstone, whether they were to capture and\nhold it, or to destroy it, or to try to put it on a boat and sink it in the sea. He\ndecided that was best left to Ka-poel. He, in turn, would take care of\nwhatever killing needed done in order to get there.\nHis eyes fell on the sharp terrain. The geography at the end of the\nHammer was a far different sight from the east coast of Fatrasta, where\nthey’d begun. Gone were the plains punctuated by bogs, lazy rivers, and\nplantation houses. Even gone were the forests and rolling hills of central\nFatrasta. The terrain through which they must now pass was a dense wood\nfilled with steep ridges and deep ravines covered in hanging mosses. It\nreminded Styke of the sharp foothills of the Ironhook Mountains, but there\nwere no mountains within hundreds of miles. The locals called it the Hock.\nSuperstitious people claimed that the Hock had been carved by a war\nbetween gods millennia ago. During his time in the labor camps, Styke had\nonce been partnered with a geologist—one of those government-employed\nfellows sent to look for likely deposits of gold ore—who had insisted that\nthis sharp terrain had been caused by immense mountains of ice creeping"

She\nwas crafty enough to stay unnoticed all the way across the country and then\ncatch them unawares in ambush. She also—so Styke assumed—had orders\nto kill Styke. Probably the same orders that Ka-Sedial had given those\ndragonmen. Would she go around the Hock and expect to catch up on the\nother side? Would she follow closely on his heels?\n“Do we have scouts back from the Hock?” he asked.\n“We do,” Ibana reported. “There’s just one major road to the coast. It has\none relay station that’s still manned by three Fatrastan troops, which means\nthe Dynize have avoided the place entirely since they landed. So we\nshouldn’t run into an army in there.”\n“And the dragoons haven’t gotten ahead of us?” He looked back to\nwhere he’d spotted the scout to their east a few minutes ago, but they had\ndisappeared.\n“Absolutely certain of it,” Gustar replied.\nHis two majors in agreement, Styke realized that rushing headlong into\nthe forest had few consequences. “Bring me your scouts, some paper, and\nsomething to draw with. I want to know exactly what the terrain looks like\nbefore we head in.”\nThree hours later, Styke crouched in the underbrush at the edge of the Hock,\nlooking out onto the road that his troops had passed through not long ago.\nHe could see clearly for almost a mile before the road curved over a hill. It\nwas empty and quiet.\nKa-poel lay beside him, using his looking glass to scan the horizon.\nCeline was somewhere a couple miles into the Hock with the camp and\nmost of the horses. Ibana and Gustar were each about three hundred yards\nto Styke’s left and right, respectively, lying in much the same position at the\nedge of the forest and waiting with bated breath for the Dynize dragoons to\nshow themselves.\nWhen Styke spotted the first scout, he rode not from the east but from\nthe south.

Styke\nignored the twinge in his leg and pressed himself lower into the brush as the\nrider came near.\nThe rider reached the road—an easy carbine shot from Styke’s position\n—and stopped. Only a few minutes passed and he was soon joined by\nanother rider from the north and then, crossing the distant hill and coming\ntoward them, a third rider. They joined in conference for a few moments\nbefore the first and second riders headed into the Hock, following the trail\nof the Mad Lancers.\n“Let them go,” Styke whispered to Jackal. The command was passed\nquietly along into the forest.\nStyke heard the clop of their hooves disappear and watched the third\nrider, who seemed content to wait.\nFifteen minutes passed, then half an hour, and then the two scouts\nreappeared to join their third companion. They conferred once again, and\nthe third took off back down the road. “They’ll report back to their\nsuperiors,” Styke whispered to Ka-poel, “that we’re camped roughly two\nmiles into the Hock in an open hollow that would be easily ambushed. The\nrest of the army will be here soon. I want you to go back to camp and keep\nan eye on Celine.”\nKa-poel gave him a thoughtful look and got to her feet, hurrying into the\nforest.\nIn less than twenty minutes, horses appeared on the horizon. They rode\nsix across, carbines held sharply at the ready. Styke recognized the woman\nat their head—it was the same officer who’d slaughtered his rear guard and\nthen tried to kill him last week. The column continued to snake down the\nroad, extending for nearly a mile with room between the horses for them to\nmaneuver. Styke guessed that they had a little under fourteen hundred\nriders, plus pack horses and spares.\nThey entered the forest so close that Styke could have thrown a rock at\nthat officer. He crouched, his fingers itching to grab for his carbine, and\nwaited the agonizingly long time until the end of their column had entered\nthe forest before finally standing up.\nThe men around him climbed to their feet and followed him as they\nheaded into the woods, following their tracks back to where they’d hidden\ntheir horses a few hundred yards up a slate-carved ravine that wouldn’t\neasily show their hoofprints. He had just fifty men with him, but they were\nhis very best—lancers who had been with him from the beginning. They\nreached their horses and donned their Dynize breastplates, mounting up.\n“Send the signal,” he ordered.\nJackal cleared his throat and hooted loudly. The call was carried over the\nnext hill, and a few moments passed before it came back to them from both\nthe north and the south.\nStyke leaned forward in the saddle, waiting.\nTwo more sets of hoots eventually followed, and Jackal nodded happily.\n“They’re in position,” he reported.\nStyke allowed a satisfied smile to cross his face and hefted his lance.\n“Wait until the firing starts,” he said.\nThey did not have to wait long.

Within minutes they heard the first\nstuttering report of a carbine salvo, followed by the screams of men and\nhorses. Styke flipped Amrec’s reins and allowed the horse to pick his way\ncarefully down the winding ravine, followed by his fifty lancers.\nA forest was, as these things went, a terrible place for cavalry to ambush\ncavalry. There was little room to maneuver for either side, and steep ravines\nmeant an easy fall for a panicking horse. However, it was an excellent place\nfor dismounted soldiers who’d had a chance to hide themselves to ambush\nan enemy cavalry force—and that’s just the ambush Ibana and Gustar’s men\nhad performed.\nStyke reached the end of the ravine and rejoined the main road just in\ntime to see the panicking rear guard of the Dynize cavalry attempting some\nkind of counterattack. They were in utter disarray—a few had dismounted\nand leapt behind horses or into the foliage, looking for cover. Some\nscrambled about in a panic, reloading from horseback, and still others had\nattempted to charge their horses into the woods only to find themselves easy\npickings on the steep banks.\nA man with red epaulets stood in his stirrups, waving his carbine and\nshouting in an attempt to organize his men. Styke’s lance clipped his arm,\nand Amrec’s shoulder hit the rider’s poor horse, sending both tumbling\ndown into the ravine on the other side of the road. Styke and his lancers\nentered the thick of the Dynize dragoons, plowing through them with the\nmomentum of a downhill charge, barely slowing to fight as they trampled\nor scattered everyone in their paths.\nThey reached a switchback, arresting their charge just enough to turn,\nand then continued on down into the ravine. The road became a mess of\nhorses and men. Styke traded his lance for a cavalry saber and fought his\nway to the bottom of the ravine. The road leveled out, giving him a chance\nto regain momentum, and he and his men surged forward.\nThis went on for well over half a mile—fighting, climbing, charging,\nhacking. The road wound as much as any mountain pass over ridges and\nthrough narrow valleys. Dismounted lancers spread along the entire trail,\nfiring from the high points and retreating up the inclines if the Dynize\nattempted to chase, while Styke charged through the middle of it to break\nup any possible semblance of Dynize cohesion.\nHe finally reached a long, straight bit of road, only to realize that he’d\nrun out of dragoons to attack. The echoes of carbine blasts were all behind\nhim now, and he searched the forest for the woman with the orange\nepaulets. There was no sign of her ahead nor evidence that she’d fled into\nthe woods.\nHe joined the mounted lancers as they caught up with him, finding\nJackal bloodied and sagging, the Mad Lancers flag flying from a broken\nlance in his outstretched hand.\n“Wounded?” Styke demanded.\n“I’ll be fine.” Jackal’s eyes shone. “We ride through them once more?”"

Less than half remained from the initial charge\n—more than he’d expected to make it. He flipped his reins and headed back\ndown the road a few hundred feet, surveying the bodies of Dynize dragoons\nand the riderless horses running scared. He stopped twice to kill horses\nbeyond help, and finished off several wounded dragoons. He found a few\nspots where hoofprints indicated that dragoons had fled into the forest, but\nstill no sign of the woman with the orange epaulets.\nHe returned to Jackal. “We took a damned risk on those roads. I saw at\nleast a dozen of us go down with lame horses. We wait here for Ibana and\nonly head back if we hear a signal.”\nThe signal—a trumpet’s call—never came, and several hours passed\nwhile the blast of carbines became less and less frequent. Styke and his\nriders let their horses rest, tending to their wounds. Jackal had taken a bullet\nin the thigh. Styke’s face was scratched to pit by branches, and his calf was\nsliced by a dragoon’s sword. The same sword had cut a nasty groove down\nAmrec’s flank, so Styke cleaned and stitched the wound. He inspected\nAmrec’s hooves for cracks and tested his legs to make sure they hadn’t been\nhurt charging up and down the steep roads.\nIt was beginning to grow dark in the hollows of the Hock when Ibana—\nstill on foot—limped into sight. She was followed by a long column of\ndismounted lancers, and they continued on toward camp as Ibana leaned\nagainst the moss-covered stump of a fallen tree. She rubbed her leg,\ngrimacing, and looked up when Styke approached.\n“You look well rested,” she said.\n“I didn’t want to send the horses back along those roads.”\nShe waved him off. “That was the right call. How did it go?”\n“I lost twenty-six riders. I imagine a few just lost their horses.” Styke\nspotted one of his old guard carrying her saddle, walking with the\ndismounted soldiers. “How about you?”\n“Seven dead.”\nStyke raised his eyebrows. “Seven?”\n“Seven dead, about sixty wounded.” A sly smile spread on Ibana’s face.\n“We butchered the shit out of those slippery bastards. They didn’t expect a\ndamned thing.”\n“Did you make a count?”\n“We counted eight hundred and thirty-some dead or wounded\ndragoons.” She waved back down the road. “Ferlisia and her scouts are\ngathering all the good horses they can find and bringing them with.”\n“Their wounded?” Styke asked.\n“Left where they lie,” Ibana said dispassionately. “If their friends come\nfind them, they might live. If not …” She shrugged.\nStyke walked Amrec beside Ibana all the way back to the Mad Lancers\ncamp. They’d left behind fifty men to set up tents and act as a guard, and\nthey reported that none of the Dynize had come this direction.

Styke found\nCeline, and the two of them watched while Sunintiel stitched the bullet\ngraze on Ibana’s leg.\n“It was a good victory?” Celine asked.\n“A very good victory,” Styke answered. He felt strangely melancholic.\nAs Ibana said, they’d absolutely slaughtered the poor bastards. Less than\nhalf of the enemy force remained—and if they wanted to press the issue,\nthey’d have to fight one-to-one with the Mad Lancers now. That should\nhave sent his spirits soaring, but something felt … off.\nPerhaps it was the ambush. Anyone could have been caught with their\npants down in the Hock. Styke liked a good ambush as well as anyone, but\na straight fight always felt better to him. The enemy commander’s greed\nhad gotten the better of her.\nHe did the rounds, Celine by his side, checking in with the sentries and\nscouts and doubling their nighttime guard against an unlikely enemy\nregrouping before he headed to his tent. He lay back, using Amrec’s saddle\nfor a pillow, and was preparing to drift off when he realized what was\nwrong.\nHe didn’t smell blood.\nHe found Ibana still doing her own rounds, startling her as he came out\nof the darkness. “Why aren’t you wearing pants?” she asked.\n“I was in my tent,” Styke answered. “Have you seen Ka-poel\nanywhere?”\n“Come to think of it, no. Not since before the ambush.”\nStyke flared his nostrils, breathing in deeply. The scent of her sorcery—\nwhich had become so ubiquitous over the last few weeks—was nowhere on\nthe wind.\n“You sent her back here, didn’t you?” Ibana asked.\nStyke recounted his footsteps. They’d been watching the Dynize scouts,\nand then he’d dismissed Ka-poel to return to the camp before the fighting\nstarted. There was no way she had gotten lost.\n“Ben?” a voice asked.\nStyke turned to find Celine rubbing her eyes.\n“Go back to bed,” he said gently. “Wait … did Ka-poel return to camp\nearlier?”\n“Yeah, she got here just a few minutes after the shooting began.”\nStyke sniffed again. Still nothing. “Are you sure?”\nCeline seemed to wake up fully, her expression growing startled. “Oh\nno.”\n“What?”\n“I was supposed to tell you something when you got back. Ka-poel said\nshe was going to find the Dynize camp.”\n“She what?” Styke and Ibana both asked at the same time. Styke ran to\nCeline’s side, kneeling down beside her so their faces were inches apart.\n“Tell me exactly what happened.”\n“Nothing happened. She just told me to tell you she had gone to find the\nenemy camp. She needed information.”\n“How is she supposed to find the enemy camp if we haven’t been able to\nfor …” Styke trailed off. Pit. She must have picked up some bit of detritus\nthat allowed her to track them. “What the pit are we supposed to do?”\n“She said to come get her in the morning,” Celine said.\nStyke exchanged a look with Ibana.

Finding their camp now, without Ka-poel’s sorcery, might\nbe next to impossible. He felt sick to his stomach at the idea of having\nridden clear across Fatrasta only to lose the ward they were supposed to be\nprotecting.\nAnd he was mad as shit that she had just gone off without saying a word\nto anyone except a little girl. “We leave her,” he spat.\nIbana seemed startled by the suggestion. “She’s the whole reason we’re\nhere.”\n“And she damn well abandoned us. We’re her bodyguard, not her valet\nservice. We’re not going to just come by and pick her up. These dragoons\nhave caused us more grief than any cavalry I can remember and I’m not\ngoing to go looking for them.” Styke was furious. He knew he wasn’t\nthinking clearly, but he didn’t care.\n“Major Gustar will be spitting mad,” Ibana cautioned. “He’s here to find\nthe godstone on orders of Lady Flint. If we abandon that mission, he’ll take\nhis Riflejacks and go.”\n“Let him.” Styke squeezed his hands into fists, wishing he had someone\nto strangle.\nIbana remained silent. Her usual sour expression had been replaced by\nsomber acceptance. “What will we do?” she asked quietly.\n“Join the war. Head back and find something to fight. There’s no need\nlacking for good cavalry.”\n“Ben,” Celine said.\n“What?” he growled. He caught her eye and forced himself to take a\nbreath. “What?” he repeated in a gentler tone.\n“You can’t leave Pole.”\n“I’m not leaving her. She left us.”\n“You left the rest of the group on your own mission,” Celine pointed out.\n“Just the other day.”\n“I told everyone I was going,” Styke said. “I didn’t just off and …” He\nsqueezed his fists tightly until he could feel his ring biting into the skin of\nhis finger. “This isn’t the same thing at all.”\nCeline stood up straighter, fixing Styke with a scowl. “You’re her\nbodyguard,” she insisted. “She anointed you. I don’t know what that means,\nbut it sounds important. She just went to get information. We can find her\nand keep going.” She folded her arms. “Or you can leave me behind, too.\nI’ll go find her myself.”\nStyke would have laughed at the image of a child telling off a crippled\ngiant if he wasn’t already so angry. He forced himself to calm down,\nbreathing evenly, trying to make himself think. After a few moments he\nstrode off into the darkness.\n“Ben, where are you going?” Ibana called after him.\nStyke found Ferlisia playing cards with several of her scouts around a\nsmall campfire. He came up behind them, picking Ferlisia up by the back of\nher shirt and holding her at eye level. She blinked at him, licking her lips,\nwhile the others watched in silence. “Can I help you, boss?” she squeaked."

She blinked at him, licking her lips,\nwhile the others watched in silence. “Can I help you, boss?” she squeaked.\n“No rest for the wicked,” he told her. “Find me those dragoons—find me\nwhere the survivors are camping, and do it before daybreak.”\nCHAPTER 45\nV\nlora spent another day watching the Vale, only to see the guard double\nand the shipments become more frequent and more thoroughly watched.\nThe next afternoon, she visited one of the local hardware stores for rope,\nand waited till dusk before setting out.\nShe took a long route, climbing the base of the mountain just as\ndarkness fully claimed the valley and positioning herself about a hundred\nyards from the entrance to the Vale on a steep, but not completely\nimpassable, part of the cliff that led up and over to Jezzy’s territory.\nShe had two problems, the way she saw it: The first was that she had to\nclimb in the dark, risking her neck on an untried route. Her second problem\nwas that she had no idea what to expect on the other side: a steep scree that\nwould be impossible to descend quietly, a gentle hill, or just a straight drop\ndown into the Vale.\nA strong powder trance heightened her vision enough that climbing in\nthe dark was, while still risky, not as perilous as it might be to another\nperson. She began her ascent quickly, visualizing the path she had laid out\nand climbing more by feel than by sight. She had just enough experience\nclimbing to know that her route would be easy for someone carrying the\nright gear, and dangerous for an amateur. She used her sorcerous strength to\nbridge the gap by keeping impossible holds with two fingers, climbing over\nshelves, and in one case leaping straight up the side of the cliff for the next\nhandhold.\nShe made it to the top of the cliff without incident, where she secured\nher two ropes. The first she dropped back the way she’d come, so the\ndescent would be easier. The second, she carried with her to the other side\nof the cliff and looked down into the Vale.\nOnce again, Flerring’s description was spot on. Nighttime Vale was a\nwide, secluded valley with a creek running through the center. At one point\nit might have been picturesque. But the trees had been ripped up, the creek\ndiverted into gold-panning sluices, and the ground covered in debris and a\nforest of dirty tents belonging to miners. It was a whole different town up\nhere, and it extended on for a good mile before winding its way up into the\nmountains.\nVlora picked out the guards easily. They wandered the tents in regular\nintervals, carrying torches and blunderbusses. Others perched up on the\nmountainside, guarding the entrances to the mines with rifles lest some\nenterprising miner slip down in to recover a lucky gold nugget. Security\nwas tight, and once again Vlora couldn’t tell if it was because Jezzy wanted\nto keep her most profitable mine safe or if she was hiding the excavation of\nthe godstone.\nThe way down was steep, but not impassable. Vlora played out the rope\nas she went, giving herself a guide for getting back up, and proceeded as\nquietly as possible. She reached the bottom and then began to make a wide"

        "text": "as she went, giving herself a guide for getting back up, and proceeded as\nquietly as possible. She reached the bottom and then began to make a wide\ncircuit around the miners’ camp, keeping eyes peeled for anything that\nwould have looked out of place in the other valleys.\nHer first target was an open pit at the very opposite end of the valley.\nCreeping slowly, she slipped past a guard stand and down to the creek, then\nmade her way uphill past the panning sluices and across what had probably\nonce been a field of wildflowers. It was a muddy cesspool now, and she\ngrimaced with each squelch her boots made.\nShe was able to reach the edge of the pit without raising an alarm, and\nknelt beside it as she peered downward, searching the depths for anything\nof question.\nNothing stood out, no sharp angles, no special equipment. She opened\nher third eye to look into the Else, and had no better luck. No color of\nsorcery. When she turned and swept the Vale with her vision, it came up\nwith the same story. If there was sorcery at work here, it must be well\nhidden.\nA previous fear crept into her thoughts as she studied the Vale: What if\nPrime Lektor was working for Lindet? Never mind the why or the how. The\nimplications were terrible. He had the knowledge of thousands of years in\nhis head, and Lindet had the ambition to use that knowledge. If they were\nworking together for some reason, Lindet suddenly became a more\ndangerous threat than even the Dynize.\nVlora attempted to ignore the worrisome niggle and continued her\ncircuit of the valley. She reached out with her sorcerous senses, each\nmoment accompanied by the feeling that something was out there.\nPinpointing the source of that feeling was like nailing down a shadow, and\nshe was forced to attribute it to her imagination and keep walking. Stones\nshifted beneath her feet, and on one occasion a guard called into the\ndarkness. But she managed to finish her search without raising an alarm,\nfinding herself back up on the cliff with her ropes several hours after she’d\ncrossed the cliffs.\nFrustration gripped her. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It was just a\ndamned gold mine, without any secrets, and she had risked her neck and\nwasted her entire week on a gamble that the stone was up here. She wanted\nto kill something, errantly wishing that an alarm would be raised so she\ncould fight her way through. She silenced the foolish thought and returned\nthe way she had come, climbing her rope down into the next valley.\nShe returned to her hotel room, where she examined a number of cuts on\nher hands and forearms earned from climbing a cliff in the dark. She\ncleaned up and wrapped the cuts on her forearms. It was almost three in the\nmorning when she finally rolled into bed, unable to think about anything\nexcept how mad she was.\nIn the morning, she would have to go to Taniel and tell him her gamble\nhad failed. He would soon be released, and they’d have to hunt down Prime\ntogether, and if that failed? She would have no choice but to bring in the\nRiflejacks.\nAn army would bring Prime out of hiding, for certain. But would he\nslaughter them all before she and Taniel could kill him?"

        "text": "Riflejacks.\nAn army would bring Prime out of hiding, for certain. But would he\nslaughter them all before she and Taniel could kill him?\nShe was just drifting off to sleep when a sound brought her bolt-upright\nin bed. She looked around, trying to find the source of it. Nearly a minute\npassed before the sound happened again, and several seconds later she\nheard something different: the distant, familiar noise of a rifle shot.\nVlora saw the bullet holes in her wall the same moment she heard the\nshot. Her heart suddenly beating hard at the close miss, she gathered her\nthings as quickly as possible and left her room, trying not to sprint. Nohan\nhad found her, and he was out there taking potshots at her room like it was\nsome sort of game. It was a damned good thing he was a bad shot. She tried\nto find him, reaching out with her senses, but at this range and without the\nrising powder smoke to guide her, it was an impossible task.\nShe left her horse in the hotel stable and crossed the city by foot. There\nwas still plenty of noise at this time of night, with dozens of brothels and\nbars open for business to miners celebrating a good day or lamenting a bad\none. Brown Bear Burt’s brothel was one such establishment, and she\nslipped inside and looked up to the second level, where she could see Burt\nsitting at his desk in a robe and pajamas, cigar in hand.\n“I need to see your boss,” she told the Palo woman standing guard at the\nbottom of Burt’s staircase.\nThe woman held up a hand. “It’s after hours.”\n“He’s right there,” Vlora said in frustration.\n“He doesn’t take visitors this time of night.”\nVlora thought about shoving her way past. Instead, she shouted his\nname. Burt looked up from a book and blinked at her. “Bella,” he said to the\nguard, “let her up!”\nBella glared daggers at Vlora but let her pass. Vlora jogged up the stairs\nand joined Burt in his office, where he offered her a cigar. Something about\nhis demeanor had changed since they’d last spoke, and he looked more\ncautious, eyeing her thoughtfully.\n“Good morning, Verundish,” he said.\nVlora didn’t return his smile. “I’m here to offer you my services.”\nThis seemed to catch him off guard. “Oh? At this hour?” He rubbed his\nchin. “What makes you think I still need them?”\n“Because everyone is panicking over that army headed this way, and\nJezzy still has that other powder mage on her payroll.”\n“True, true,” Burt admitted. He puffed on the stub of his cigar and put it\nout, then leaned forward at his desk and began to fiddle with a new cigar,\nrunning it thoughtfully under his nose and breathing deeply as he watched\nher. “About that army,” he said slowly. “What do you know about it?”\n“Absolutely nothing,” she said in a tone that she hoped would\ndiscourage any more questions. He obviously suspected something—with\nseveral powder mages in town, Nohan couldn’t have been the only one to\nmake the logical leap that they were related to Lady Flint’s army camped\nnearby.\n“Nothing?” he echoed."

What sort of services are you offering?”\n“I’m offering to kill that other powder mage for you. I want to duel him.\nPublic, private, I don’t care. Set up a fight, and dangle a wager in front of\nJezzy. The powder mage will come—I know he will.” Vlora chewed on her\nlip, hoping that Burt would take her up on the offer. Nohan was no longer a\nnuisance. He had almost killed her tonight, and she wanted him out of the\npicture completely before she and Taniel went after Prime Lektor.\nBurt cut the tip off the new cigar with a boz knife he pulled out of a\ndrawer, his eyes staring at the middle distance between them. Slowly, he\nbegan to nod. “What do you want in exchange?”\n“I want you to tell your men to stand down when the Riflejack army\nmarches through. They aren’t here for you. I don’t want roadblocks or\nfighting or any such thing.” She was taking an awful risk admitting she was\nwith the Riflejacks—any fool who had read her description in the paper\nwould be able to figure out who she really was. But she had to take that\nrisk. She was out of time, and she needed to simplify the conclusion of this\nmission as much as possible.\n“You’re confident you can kill him despite your wounds?” Burt asked,\nlighting his cigar. “Those hands look pretty banged up.”\n“Nohan and I have already crossed paths once. He came away worse for\nit than I did.”\nHe tapped one fingernail against the blade of the knife. “I have no\ninterest in getting in anyone’s way,” he said. “If the Riflejacks aren’t after\nmy gold, I have no problem with them.”\n“You know that Lady Flint has a price on her head.”\n“And an army of riflemen out there,” Burt replied. “I’m not stupid\nenough to tangle with Adran soldiers. Besides, the bounty is nothing\ncompared to what this valley makes me every week. I’ll offer Jezzy a wager\nand a duel. You do some killing, and I think we’ll part friends.”\n“I would like that,” Vlora said. She felt herself relax, knowing that the\nend of this damned mission was almost upon her. She was probably going\nto get all her soldiers killed in a confrontation with an ancient sorcerer, she\nreasoned, but at least she wasn’t going to have to rub shoulders with these\npeople anymore.\nCHAPTER 46\nW\nhat have you been doing in here the last couple of days?”\nMichel looked up from his studies, taking a moment to pull his head out\nof long lists of family, Household, and regiment names and blink across the\nempty room to where Ichtracia lounged on a divan in the sunlight.

        "text": "empty room to where Ichtracia lounged on a divan in the sunlight. He\nthought, for the hundredth time, of a cat playing with a mouse before the\nfinal kill, and forced a distracted smile onto his face. “Do you mind if I call\nyou Tricia?” he asked.\nIchtracia raised one eyebrow. “Only if I can call you Mick.”\n“I’d rather not … oh, I see your point. That’s fair.” Michel looked back\ndown at the book laid out on the table in front of him. He was in a dusty\nroom on the second floor of the capitol building where Yaret’s people had\nstashed most of the records they had brought with them from Dynize. The\nfloor-to-ceiling bookshelves were packed with ledgers, and thousands more\nsat in crates or piled up in the corners. Very little of it was organized in any\nuseful way and Michel had spent far too long just doing that. He considered\nIchtracia’s still-raised eyebrow and remembered that she’d asked him a\nquestion. “I’m cataloging everyone that Forgula has worked with since the\nbeginning of the invasion.”\n“That seems like an awful lot of work.”\nMichel squinted at her. She was right, of course. It was mind-numbingly\nboring; something that he would prefer to leave to a small army of clerks.\nBut he couldn’t just tell her that he was combing the army regimental\nrecords for someone named Mara. “This is something we’d do in the\nBlackhats,” he told her. “We had a file on just about every enemy of the\nstate, and it included all their contacts and family members. It helped us\nunwind conspiracies and root out cells of dissidents.”\nMichel had his own opinions on how useful those files actually were,\nbut he needed the excuse to be up here, combing through all of these names.\n“You should have someone else do that,” Ichtracia said. She stretched on\nthe divan, a casual smile on her face, watching Michel in a way that made it\nvery clear what she thought he should be doing. He’d spent the last two\nnights at her townhouse and learned firsthand how that particular rumor\nabout Privilegeds happened to be true. It had been a welcome bit of\nrelaxation, for sure, but it had also been incredibly distracting.\nShe was damned distracting. She’d been lounging on that divan for\ntwenty minutes, and Michel had read the same regimental record over and\nover again since she arrived. He couldn’t stop glancing up at her, watching\nher face when she wasn’t paying attention.\nHe caught himself watching her again, and rubbed his eyes. This search\nwasn’t going anywhere. He’d looked through at least twenty thousand\nnames and not a single Mara had popped up—not among the civilians nor\nthe military. As Emerald had suggested, it wasn’t even a Dynize name. He\nfelt like his hands were tied; his whole purpose here was to find and extract\nthis Mara, but he’d run out of places to look.\n“There was another bombing this afternoon.”\n“I heard,” Michel answered. “I imagine the Blackhats won’t stop their\nbombings just because their Dynize patron has been cut off.”\n“Sedial is just biding his time, by the way.”\nMichel looked up sharply. Ichtracia was cleaning her nails, lips pursed."

        "text": "bombings just because their Dynize patron has been cut off.”\n“Sedial is just biding his time, by the way.”\nMichel looked up sharply. Ichtracia was cleaning her nails, lips pursed.\nSwitching from the bombing to Sedial so quickly seemed like a non\nsequitur, but she didn’t look distracted. Michel said, “I’m not sure what you\nmean.”\n“That stunt with Forgula—he’ll take it personally. He takes everything\nlike that personally. Sooner or later—and I’m guessing sooner—he’ll start\nasking Yaret why the bombings haven’t been stopped. He’ll ask why\nForgula’s death didn’t put an end to the attacks, and why Yaret’s pet\nBlackhat hasn’t dug up his former compatriots yet.”\nMichel was more than aware of all this—or at least he’d surmised it.\nHaving his suspicions about Sedial’s anger be confirmed wasn’t exactly\ncomforting. “I’m looking,” he assured her. “We have hundreds of people\nout trying to dig up je Tura’s hiding spot. We’ve searched every safe house\nthat I know about and looted all their caches. We’ve arrested nearly four\nhundred known Blackhats.”\n“And yet je Tura is staying one step ahead of you.”\nMichel pursed his lips, trying to keep a neutral expression. Ichtracia was\nfriendly, even charming, but he had to constantly remind himself that she\nwas a Privileged. All she had to do was put on her gloves and she could\nbreak him in two, so it was best not to snap at her when she needled. “I\nhave no idea how. Je Tura will need dozens of men to conduct his\nbombings. He needs a network to supply the powder, make the bombs, and\ncase his targets. We’ve scrubbed the city of his people as thoroughly as we\ndamned well can and yet he still evades me.” Michel sat back, grinding his\nteeth.\n“Oh, don’t look so put out,” Ichtracia murmured. She rolled off the\ndivan and crossed the room, coming around behind Michel. To his surprise,\nshe began to rub his shoulders. “Look, I see what you’re doing here,” she\nsaid gently. “If you create a web of conspiracy around Forgula, true or not,\nthen you’ll be able to keep Sedial on the back foot. You can accuse his\npeople, keep the other Households in suspicion of his motives, and perhaps\nstay ahead of him.”\nMichel felt himself stiffen up. Ichtracia’s tone was helpful, but he\ncouldn’t help but hear a note of something sinister in her words. That was\nexactly what he had convinced Yaret he was up here doing, and Ichtracia\nhad seen through it effortlessly.

        "text": "harder for him to take his vengeance on … and he has been known to be\nforgiving to people who make themselves useful.”\nMichel tried to enjoy the back rub, pressing the back of his head against\nher chest. Rumors had it that Ichtracia and her grandfather didn’t exactly\nget along, so maybe she really was on his side. Or perhaps she was lulling\nhim into a false sense of security.\nHe pushed the book away from him, eyes closed, trying to form his own\nplans. “Do I have a future with the Dynize?” he asked.\nIchtracia’s hands stopped moving. “Why do you ask?”\n“Because I’m an outsider. I know what happens to outsiders. The\nmoment I am no longer useful, I will be either forgotten or destroyed.”\n“You should have thought of that before coming to our doorstep.” Again,\nthe tone was not unkind, but in it she made it very clear that she’d be\noffering little sympathy. She paused, then let out a soft sigh. “You may,” she\nsaid cautiously. “You’re quite clever, though whether you’re just the right\namount to keep from being eaten alive remains to be seen. You’re also\nuseful. I’ve always thought of the Dynize as xenophobic, but next to you\nKressians we’re practically loving of other cultures.” She let go of his\nshoulders and crossed to the other side of the table from him. “Put away the\nbooks,” she suggested. “Come to the Foxhead Club with me for the rest of\nthe evening.”\nThe Foxhead Club was a bit of a joke among the Dynize. They’d taken\nan exclusive gentleman’s club in the center of Landfall and turned out the\nKressians, making it available only to Dynize and Palo upper crust. Michel\nwondered briefly if he’d be turned away, but imagined that no one would\nturn away the guest of a Privileged. He leaned forward, examining her face,\nwondering what time it was. Perhaps he should take a break. “Where do\nyou fit into all of this?” he asked.\n“All of what?”\n“This.” Michel gestured expansively around him. “Sedial. Yaret. The\nHouseholds. Tenik told me that Privileged aren’t allowed to be political in\nyour culture. In Kressian culture they have their fingers in everything, and\n…” Michel trailed off, realizing that he’d let himself forget who he was\ntalking to. When he was in the Blackhats, he probably would have balked at\neven addressing a Privileged, let alone speaking so candidly with one.\nIchtracia regarded him casually, tapping on the table with one long\nfingernail. “It is complicated, as you may imagine.” She paused, frowning\ndown at her hands, and for a moment Michel thought that perhaps her cool,\ncollected mask had slipped. “Do you know about dragonmen?” she asked.\n“I’ve heard the rumors.”\n“Dragonmen and Privileged hold the same position in Dynize society.\nWe belong to the emperor. We are not people, nor citizens. We are tools.\nWhen we are needed, we serve without flinching, without questioning.\nWhen we are not needed, we are left to our own devices. We have no power\nof our own, not in a political sense, but we have a sort of power simply by\nbeing tools of the emperor.”"

We have no power\nof our own, not in a political sense, but we have a sort of power simply by\nbeing tools of the emperor.”\nMichel opened his mouth to respond, but found he had nothing to say.\nThe idea of being a possession had never even occurred to him, and the\nslight crack in Ichtracia’s voice when she spoke of it told volumes. “I …”\nHe hesitated. “If you’re a possession of the emperor’s, and Sedial is the\nemperor’s man on this continent, then …”\nIchtracia’s slipping facade suddenly became cool and casual again and\nshe regarded him with a dispassionate sort of annoyance. “I wouldn’t worry\ntoo much about your own skin. Sedial may think he is the emperor, but he\ndefinitely is not. It’s no secret that he and I do not get along. I have no\nintention of handing you over to him.”\n“I didn’t mean—”\nShe cut him off. “It’s all right. You want to know where you stand, and I\nwon’t begrudge you that. So here is this: I find you fascinating. You are an\ninnocuous and boring person on the surface, but there are layers beneath\nyour facade that I think I’d enjoy peeling away. I intend on playing with\nyou for at least a few months before I cut you loose and move on to the\nhusband of a minister or the daughter of a general. I will enjoy our time\ntogether, and I suspect you intend on doing the same. Do not expect\nanything more of me than you would a tool of the state, and I won’t expect\nmore of you than I would a spy who knows he needs someone to protect\nhim from the lions among my people.”\nFor a moment, Michel felt as if he’d been slapped. The shock was gone\nwithin seconds, and he found himself laughing.\n“What’s so funny?” Ichtracia demanded.\nMichel reached out a hand. “Thank you for that. It’s incredibly\nrefreshing.” She knew that he was using her to protect himself from Sedial,\nand she didn’t give a damn. Somehow that knowledge relieved Michel, the\nidea that he wasn’t hiding just one more thing from another person. “I’m\nsorry if I’m being rude, but you’re far more pragmatic than I expected. I\nlike that.”\nIchtracia took his hand with a look of wariness. Slowly, that feline smile\nspread across her face. “Don’t apologize. It’s tiresome, and I don’t want to\nfind you tiresome quite yet.” She released his hand and slid the ledger he’d\nbeen reading off the table with a clatter. “Your work is done for the night.\nCome with me to the club.”\n“Can I meet you there?”\n“How long?”\n“An hour.”\n“Don’t keep me waiting.” With a single glance back, Ichtracia strode\nfrom the room.\nMichel waited for about ten minutes before cleaning up the ledgers he’d\nbeen looking through and then scrawling a quick note on a piece of paper\nand heading for the door.

Ichtracia was right—he couldn’t focus on looking\nthrough records anymore. He needed to focus on the Blackhats. He could\nabandon the idea of attacking Sedial through Forgula’s associates, and also\nset aside his search for Mara.\nAt least for the time being.\nHe headed across town on foot, doubling back and waiting at intervals to\nbe sure he wasn’t followed, then headed down into Emerald’s morgue,\nwhere he found Emerald standing over the open chest cavity of a cadaver, a\nlength of intestine in one hand. He paused his work as Michel entered and\nshook his head.\n“You obviously haven’t been shot again. I hope you have a damn good\nreason for coming down here so soon.”\n“Can you get a message to Taniel?”\n“Hmph,” Emerald responded, setting down the intestine and resting his\nhand on the cold, dead forehead of the man lying on his workbench. “It’s\npossible.”\nMichel pulled out the note he’d written and double-checked it, taking a\ndeep breath. Perhaps it was his recent victory against Forgula—perhaps it\nwas this new relationship with Ichtracia—but he felt like he needed to focus\non his work for the Dynize. No more searching ledgers for a mysterious\nname. The note simply said:\nTarget can’t be found. Need more information. Will remain in place. It\nwas written in a cipher he and Taniel had come up with years ago. “Get this\nto Taniel. Any idea how long until I can get an answer?”\nEmerald nodded at Michel to set the note on his workbench. “Two to six\nweeks. Maybe longer, if I have trouble finding him. I’ll see what I can do.”\nHe sighed, clearly irritated, and pointed at Michel with a bloody hand. “You\nhave to stop coming down here. If I hear back from Taniel, I’ll find you and\nlet you know. Until then …”\n“Right, right. I’ll be easy to find.” Michel backed out and headed up to\nthe street. He stopped, checking his watch and realizing he’d be half an\nhour later than he told Ichtracia. “I’ll be either in bed with the enemy or in a\nshallow grave somewhere.”\nCHAPTER 47\nS\ntyke sat in the deep, oppressive darkness of the Hock, listening to the\nsounds of the forest and the distant snores of lancers in their beds. Unable to\nsleep, he’d found a spot on the edge of a ravine some fifty yards from the\ncamp where he could see the smallest sliver of starlight through the thick\nbranches overhead. Somewhere nearby, a critter stirred in the underbrush,\napproaching him slowly and fleeing when he shifted to get more\ncomfortable.\nHis mind was a mess of conflicting thoughts as he considered the whole\nof his life for the first time since the labor camps and wondered if perhaps\nhe was not the person he’d always fancied himself. He thought of\nValyaine’s statement about Styke expecting loyalty and obedience but never\ngiving his own. He thought about Celine’s defiance in defense of Ka-poel,\nreminding him that he would—and had—gone off on his own and just\nexpected the lancers to be there when he returned."

He thought about Celine’s defiance in defense of Ka-poel,\nreminding him that he would—and had—gone off on his own and just\nexpected the lancers to be there when he returned.\nIt was one thing to be called a hypocrite by a full-grown man he\nintended to kill. It was a whole other to have that confirmed by a little girl.\nStyke wondered if perhaps, all these years, even while losing himself in\nthe labor camps, he had bought into his own legend: that of an unkillable\nmonster, a force of nature. Maybe deep down he had begun to believe what\npeople said about him.\nHe heard someone coming from the camp through the underbrush\ntoward him. He could tell from the weight of the step and the way she\nmoved that it was Ibana. She joined him up there, settling down next to him\nand pushing a skin into his hands. He smelled wine and took a sip.\n“What are you doing up here?” she asked. “It’s four in the morning.”\n“Couldn’t sleep,” Styke responded.\nThey shared a few companionable minutes in silence, handing the\nwineskin back and forth, and Styke felt a calmness come over him from\nIbana’s presence. They had not been this close—physically—since the war\nand it felt good to feel her hand brush his as they exchanged the wine.\nShe’d been a guidepost since the beginning of the Mad Lancers, his\nlevelheaded second-in-command, the one who would keep everything\nrunning even when he had to meet with Lindet or assassinate an enemy\ngeneral or any of the other shit he got up to.\n“I’ve been thinking …” Styke began.\n“I’ve warned you to let me do the thinking.” There was a long pause,\nand Ibana let out a soft sigh. “About what?”\n“About being a hypocrite.”\nIbana snorted. “Still? Is this because Valyaine called you one?”\n“Celine did, too, just a couple hours ago. I think that I am, and I don’t\nreally like the feeling it gives me. I’ve always looked down on officers and\npoliticians as hypocrites and cowards, and now, so long into this life, I\nrealize that I am what I’ve always derided.”\nIbana remained silent, so Styke continued. “I am a hypocrite, but I think\nI am too far along for it to be helped. To break my hypocrisy, I would have\nto swear allegiance to some higher power, or I would have to dismiss the\nMad Lancers and head off on my own path. I am not willing to do either.”\nHe felt Ibana shake beside him, and it took him several moments to realize\nthat she was laughing at him. “What the pit is so funny?”\nShe put a hand on his thigh and leaned over, and he was surprised to feel\nher lips against his cheek. She pulled away, wiping her sleeve across her\neyes and chuckling. “You really think you’re a hypocrite? I’ll give you one\nthing: You were a hypocrite. Your double standard during the war was\nsomething we all decided to let slide because of who and what you are.”\n“So you discussed this?” Styke asked, incredulous. “Behind my back?”\n“You think you’re the only one to bad-mouth your superiors?”"

It was so simple. So stupid and\nobvious. Another hypocrisy. “What am I?” he asked.\n“You’re Ben Styke.”\n“Because you say I am,” Styke insisted. He felt angry, confused. He was\nnot used to delving this deep into his own insecurities. He had always\ntrampled them underfoot, ignoring them like so much garbage, and moved\non with his life. Why couldn’t he now? The old way had gotten results, and\nhe needed results right now.\n“You’re not just Ben Styke because we say you are, though I admit that\nthe allegiance of the people who follow you gives your name weight,”\nIbana said thoughtfully. “You’re Ben Styke because you always lead the\ncharge. Because you can break a Warden’s back and crack a dragonman’s\nskull. Because you’re big and strong enough to do whatever you want and\nyet you still have a sense of right and wrong. Even if it’s a twisted one.”\nStyke stared through the darkness at his crippled hands, feeling the\ntwinges in his wrist when he moved his fingers. He thought about how his\ndoubt and pain went away when he wrapped his fingers around the lance\nand how all his other failings seemed to disappear when he charged into the\nface of the enemy.\n“You’re not a hypocrite, Ben,” Ibana said. “You were, but you aren’t\nanymore.”\n“I haven’t changed.”\n“Haven’t you?” Ibana demanded. “The old you wouldn’t have spared\nTenny Wiles or Valyaine. Definitely not Dvory. Not a chance. The old you\nwouldn’t have sworn allegiance to Lady Flint. Seeing the way you look at\nher is the first time I’ve seen you truly respect a superior officer.” She\nticked off two fingers, then a third. “You took Celine under your wing, and\nyou’ve always hated kids. Besides”—Ibana laughed again—“you didn’t ask\nany of us to follow you. We came because we saw that you needed us—not\nbecause we needed you.”\nStyke felt his inner turmoil begin to ebb. “You’re a better liar than I\nremember.”\n“No lies,” Ibana said. “Maybe I dressed it up a little. But it’s still the\ntruth. And I still stand behind what I said before: We’re here now, and we’re\nall depending on you to remain Ben Styke. You can be a different man and\nstill lead the charges.”\n“Do you think the men doubt me because I let Tenny, Valayine, and\nDvory live?” Styke asked.\n“Look, I know I gave you shit before, but to be honest … any grumbles\nthat might have spread were silenced when we came upon you facing down\nsix dragonmen,” Ibana said.\nStyke chuckled. “I didn’t do that by choice.”\n“But you still did it.

Pit, I’d run.”\nThey finished off the wine, sitting in silence for some time before Ibana\ndrew in a quick breath, then laughed softly.\n“What?” Styke asked.\n“It’s Celine,” she said, as if it were the simplest thing in the world.\n“What do you mean?”\n“I mean that all these things—these doubts, these changes—that have\ncome over you, they’re not because you faced a firing squad or spent a\ndecade in the camps. They’re because you have a child now.”\nStyke felt his face flush. “She’s not mine.”\n“Oh, please. I’ve heard you refer to her as ‘my girl.’ You’re not fooling\nanyone, least of all me. Celine is your child whether she came from your\nloins or not, and that’s made you a different man.” She turned toward him,\nand even in the darkness he could feel her piercing stare. “Tell me, do you\nfear death?”\n“Of course,” Styke scoffed. “Everyone fears death.”\n“There’s a difference between being suicidal and not fearing death,”\nIbana said, “and the Ben I knew never feared death. So do you?”\nStyke thought about it for a moment. Death was such an abstract notion:\nIt always felt so far away, but he knew better than most that it could strike\nat any moment. He’d been within a knife blade of death on hundreds of\noccasions, and sometimes closer. When he said he feared death, it was a\nmechanical lie, said because that’s what normal people were supposed to\nsay. He had never feared death. Even when Fidelis Jes had cut him down,\nleaving him in a puddle of his own blood, he had not feared death. He had\nonly feared leaving this world without taking Fidelis Jes with him.\nAnd, he realized, he had feared one other thing.\n“I don’t,” he said. “But I fear leaving Celine alone.”\n“I call it the same thing,” Ibana said, sitting back. “Fearing your death\nbecause you won’t go on living versus fearing your death because someone\nelse needs you is just semantics. You fear for Celine, and I’ve never known\nyou to fear. You look at her in a way you’ve never looked at a friend or a\nlover, including me.”\nStyke realized that he heard a note of hurt in her voice. He swallowed,\nuncertain of what to say, and decided to let it go. She had not meant for him\nto hear it.\nHe felt her hand on his thigh again, and her body shifted toward his; her\nface drew close. “Quiet the inner demons, Ben,” she told him. “They’ve\nnever been worth your time before, and they certainly shouldn’t be now.”\nThey were interrupted by the sound of hooves along the trail on the\nridge above them. Ibana pulled away, and Styke listened as the hooves\ndescended the road down into the hollow where the lancers camped. He\nheard a distant voice that he recognized as Ferlisia’s call his name.\nIbana sighed, slapping him on the shoulder. “Go on. You’ve got work to\ndo.”\nReluctantly, Styke descended the ridge and headed into the camp. He"

        "text": "Ibana sighed, slapping him on the shoulder. “Go on. You’ve got work to\ndo.”\nReluctantly, Styke descended the ridge and headed into the camp. He\nfound Ferlisia outside his empty tent, scowling at one of the guards. He put\nhis hand on her shoulder, turning her around and gesturing for her to lower\nher voice. “Did you find them?” he asked.\n“I did,” she said excitedly. “They’re camped about three miles from\nhere. They’re not trying to hide, but they picked a place that would be\nsuicide for us to attack: a hill just inside the eastern edge of the Hock with\nsteep sides and only one spot that horses could easily climb. They have lots\nof wounded men and horses.”\nStyke took a deep breath. Ka-poel would be there, no doubt. She was\nresourceful enough that she was probably still alive—unless the enemy\ncommander had orders to kill her in particular. He lifted his head, seeing\nIbana emerge from the woods. “Go find Jackal for me,” he told her.\n“Are we going to attack?” Ibana asked.\n“Not exactly.”\nCHAPTER 48\nS\ntyke and Jackal were led to the dragoon camp by Ferlisia, arriving just\nbefore sunrise. Too late to work beneath the cover of darkness, he sent\nFerlisia back to camp and he and Jackal huddled down in the Hock and\nwaited and watched throughout the day.\nThe dragoon camp was much as Ferlisia described it: packed onto a\nlong, wooded hill just inside the Hock. The hill was surrounded on all four\nsides by steep, rocky cliffs, between ten and fifty feet high, making it a\nsolid defensive position against any force and doubly impossible to attack\nwith cavalry. There appeared to be only one easy way up—a gentle slope\npointing east less than two dozen feet wide and guarded heavily.\nThe cries of wounded men and horses could be heard throughout the\nday, and the occasional carbine blast sounded as they put down lame\nanimals. It became abundantly clear that the dragoons didn’t care if Styke\nknew where they were. Their defensive position was unbreakable by less\nthan a brigade of infantry, and they knew that Styke didn’t have that kind of\nfirepower at his command.\nNor, they must have surmised, did Styke want to take the time to starve\nthem off their high ground. The Dynize could wait for as long as their\nsupplies held out, tending to their men. The ambush must have cooled their\ncommander, making Styke doubly angry at Ka-poel for sneaking off. If\nshe’d stuck around, the lancers would already be on their way to the coast.\nStyke lay on his stomach in the underbrush about a hundred yards from\nthe entrance to the hill, watching the dragoons change their guard as the\ndaylight began to wane. Jackal lay beside him, apparently asleep, until his\neyes suddenly opened and he got up onto his elbows, pointing at the hill.\n“It’s an old Palo settlement,” he said.\n“Eh?”\n“I’ve been talking to the spirits. That hill. It was home to a village once.\nIt’s been a few hundred years, but there are some old spirits left hanging\nabout. They fled because your bone-eye is there.”"

They fled because your bone-eye is there.”\nStyke snorted. The idea that Ka-poel could scare long-dead spirits still\nseemed preposterous. But at least it confirmed that she was, indeed, here.\n“Is she still alive?”\n“According to the spirits, yes. It’s hard to coax them to come this close\nto her.”\n“Can they tell us anything about the hill?”\n“They called it the Castle, back when they lived there. Or their word for\n‘castle,’ anyway. As long as they held it, their tribe could not be ousted from\ntheir land.”\n“What happened?”\n“Brudanian soldiers. They wanted to clear the Hock so that trappers\ncould use it. Lost half their regiment taking the Castle from the Palo.”\nJackal waggled a finger at the entrance to the Castle. “They tried to assault\nthat and failed. Ended up putting ladders on the lowest cliff on the south\nside and overwhelming the occupants with sheer numbers.”\n“Show me.”\nStyke and Jackal pulled back beneath the closest ridgeline and took a\nlong, circuitous route around the Castle. The dragoons had plenty of scouts,\nbut they seemed to focus their efforts deeper in the Hock, at the halfway\npoint between their camp and that of the Mad Lancers. Other than hiding on\noccasion, Styke and Jackal reached the south side of the Castle without\nissue.\nThe cliffs here were indeed the lowest—perhaps ten or fifteen feet of\nnear-vertical rock. A single dragoon stood watch at the top, peering into the\nforest as darkness began to spread, cradling his carbine. Styke continued\nalong the south side and looped around to the west, searching for better\nspots to climb the cliffs and finding nothing that looked promising. He\nreturned to Jackal, falling onto his hands and knees to watch that one\ndragoon patrol the top of the shallow cliff.\n“Do you remember the fortress at New Adopest?” Styke asked.\nJackal’s placid face wrinkled, the hint of a smile on his lips. “I\nremember it.”\n“I’m not as spry as I used to be,” Styke said. He wanted very badly to\nclimb the cliff and do the job himself, but he did not have confidence in his\nown abilities to do so in silence. He shot a glance at the wound on Jackal’s\nleg. “Are you?”\n“None of us are,” Jackal replied. “But I think I’m up to the task.” He\ntouched his leg. “This looks worse than it is, and there were a lot more\nguards at New Adopest.”\nTwilight was quickly upon them, and Styke and Jackal got to their feet.\nThey moved slowly through the underbrush, careful not to make too much\nnoise, until they were at the very base of the Castle cliff. The guard had\nchanged, and another man now patrolled this small section, torch in hand.\nJackal waited until the guard had passed, and began his ascent, climbing\nthe cliffside in almost complete silence.

Styke pressed himself against the cliff to hide from the light\nof the torch.\nSilence followed, though Styke strained to listen for a grunt or a yell. A\nfew moments later he heard a distinctive “Psst” and began his own ascent.\nHe reached the top to find Jackal standing over the body of the sentry.\nJackal stood stiffly, his posture all wrong, like a deer too scared to run.\n“Everything okay?” Styke whispered.\nJackal nudged the body with his foot. “He just offed himself.”\n“What?”\nJackal came close, leaning in to whisper in Styke’s ear. “I stepped on a\ntwig. He turned to look at me and instead of shouting out, he drew his knife\nand slit his own throat.”\nThe hairs on the back of Styke’s neck stood up, goose bumps spreading\non his arms. He knelt beside the body and found the guard clutching his\nown knife, still lightly convulsing as he silently bled out onto the dirt. Styke\nreached out to touch him but pulled his hand back, thinking better of it. He\nleaned over, putting his nose up next to the body. He took a deep breath,\ncatching hints of copper.\nHe stood up to find Jackal’s knife out, breath held, staring toward a pair\nof Dynize dragoons about thirty feet away. Styke held his breath, waiting\nfor a shout, as the pair slowly approached them.\nStyke readied his boz knife, preparing to spring forward when they got\nclose enough, but was arrested when they spoke out in unison in perfect\nAdran. “You’re wanted at the commander’s tent, Colonel Styke.”\nJackal’s lips were pulled back in a snarl, nostrils flared. “I can’t see a\nspirit for a mile,” he said. “Even the ones I was talking to back in the forest\nhave fled.”\n“Please,” the pair of dragoons said again. “You’re wanted at the\ncommander’s tent.” Their words were mechanical, their backs straight and\nfaces forward, though they stood at an angle to Styke and Jackal. “Follow\nus.” They turned in unison and marched into the camp.\nStyke kept his knife handy, looking at Jackal and seeing the whites of\nhis eyes. He’d never seen Jackal this startled, not even facing down\nPrivileged sorcery on an open battlefield.\n“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Jackal whispered. “Is this her\nsorcery?”\n“I think it is,” Styke said. “Or the sorcery of a bone-eye who wants us to\nthink it’s Ka-poel. But I didn’t know the bone-eyes are capable of this kind\nof control.” Hesitating just a moment longer, he followed the pair of guards\ninto the camp, Jackal bringing up a reluctant rear.\nThe camp was quiet, with the occasional cookfire burning to coals and\nonly a handful of Dynize up and about. None of them seemed to notice\nStyke and Jackal, and he wondered if they were also under some kind of\nsorcery or if they were just that inattentive within their own camp. He heard"

He heard\nthe occasional scream or moan from the east—the wounded from the other\nday’s ambush—and they passed a corral in the open center of the hill where\nnearly three hundred horses were tied up for the night.\nThe two guards suddenly stopped in between a row of tents, stepping in\ndifferent directions and gesturing for Styke to go ahead. He looked over his\nshoulder at Jackal, who still looked like an animal who wasn’t sure whether\nto attack or run. With a shrug, Styke continued between the two guards.\nThere was a large clearing in front of a tent bigger than all the others\naround it—no doubt belonging to the company commander. A well-stocked\nfire and a handful of torches illuminated a macabre scene in the middle of\nthe clearing. Two dozen Dynize soldiers—all of them wearing epaulets that\nmarked them as officers—sat cross-legged in two rows on either side of the\nclearing. They didn’t look up when Styke approached, or seem to move at\nall. They were so inhumanly still that he wondered if they were still alive.\nAcross from the tent stood the officer that Styke had brawled with when\nthey ambushed the Mad Lancers a few weeks back. Her hands were clasped\nbehind her back, her spine straight. She had the same expression as Jackal\nwith eyes wide and lips pulled back, but hers was as strangely frozen as\nthose of the men flanking her.\nYears ago, Styke had been present when a gift had been sent from the\nking of Kez to then-governor Lindet of Redstone. The gift consisted of\nseveral life-sized facsimiles of Kez soldiers done up in wax. They were so\nwell done that they looked like the real thing, until they began to melt in the\nFatrastan heat. This scene had the same uncanny strangeness to it.\nSprawled in a camp chair like a bored queen receiving guests was Ka-\npoel. She lifted a hand in greeting to Styke, the other propped under her\nchin as she gazed at the dragoon commander.\nStyke put away his knife and gestured for Jackal to do the same.\n“I thought you were going to come for me this morning.”\nStyke nearly jumped out of his skin. The words came from the mouth of\nthe commander, but they were spoken in perfect Adran and in a voice that\ndid not belong to a burly, war-weary dragoon officer. The tone was soft-\nspoken, the voice a gentle soprano with a hint of a laugh to it. He looked at\nKa-poel, who hadn’t moved except to adopt a rather smug smile. He\npointed at the officer. “Is that you?”\nKa-poel nodded.\nStyke forced himself to relax. He walked down the line of frozen\nofficers, leaning over to feel the soft breath coming from their lips and wave\na hand in front of their eyes. He even pushed one over, watching him topple\nlike a statue and remain cross-legged without so much as a flinch.

Upon this closer look, he found her just as\nfrozen as her men—except the eyes. They stared straight ahead, but there\nwas life in them, and if he was forced to guess, he would say that she was\nstill there, under the surface.\nStyke wondered at this show of power. He’d been told that Ka-poel was\nmore powerful than her fellow bone-eyes by several orders of magnitude,\nbut that she was unpracticed. Could an enemy bone-eye do this to Styke?\nCould she do this to Styke? The answer to that second question was an\nobvious yes, and it made Styke’s skin crawl.\nHe considered what Ji-Orz had told him earlier this week, likening the\nsorcery of a bone-eye to rape. The thought—and all these frozen faces—\nmade Styke uncomfortable.\nJackal still stood outside the clearing, looking like he wanted nothing to\ndo with any of this. Ka-poel barely seemed to notice his presence, and\nStyke waved him off. “Go back to camp,” he told Jackal. “Tell Ibana that\neverything is in control here. We’ll be back soon.”\nThe words were barely out of his mouth when Jackal took off into the\ndarkness.\n“Will he be attacked leaving the camp?” Styke asked Ka-poel.\n“No,” she answered through the mouth of the commander.\n“Do you have control of the whole camp?” he asked.\n“Not exactly,” Ka-poel said. “I have about a third of them. Enough to\nremain unmolested.”\nStyke walked around the commander once more, then over to Ka-poel.\nDespite her smugness, he could see she was uneasy. He wondered how\nmuch practice she had being up close and personal with the people she\ncontrolled. “We didn’t find this camp until almost light this morning,” he\nsaid in answer to her earlier question. “I didn’t know you had things under\ncontrol, so I didn’t want to risk coming during the day.”\nKa-poel pursed her lips, nodding as if this were a satisfactory\nexplanation. “I’m almost done here. We can go soon.”\nStyke faced her, leaning over her until their faces were inches apart. “I\nwant to know why you’re here.”\n“Answers,” she replied shortly. She was unintimidated by his size,\nreturning his look coolly. Styke reminded himself that he was just as\nunintimidated by her sorcery. Disconcerted by it, yes. But it did not scare\nhim, and he wanted her to know that.\n“What kind of answers?”\nThat uncertainty that he had seen in her eyes suddenly came to the\nforefront. She scowled distractedly into the darkness. “The kind that I\ncannot get from anyone else but a Dynize officer,” she said.\n“Such as?”\nKa-poel did not answer. She sighed heavily, and Styke left her to stand\nin front of the commander. “Is she still in there?” he asked.\n“Yes, she is. They all are, to different degrees.”\n“I want to talk to her.”\nKa-poel’s eyebrows rose. She shrugged, and a sheen of sweat suddenly"

        "text": "“Yes, she is. They all are, to different degrees.”\n“I want to talk to her.”\nKa-poel’s eyebrows rose. She shrugged, and a sheen of sweat suddenly\nsprang to the face of the Dynize commander, her eyes widening further,\nface tensing. “What do you want?” she snarled in Dynize. This, Styke\nrealized, was her real voice.\n“Who are you?” Styke asked in Palo. He repeated the question slowly to\nmake sure she understood.\nThe sweating grew more severe. He wondered if she was struggling\nagainst Ka-poel’s hold on her, and if it was possible to break it. “Can you\nforce her to answer?” he asked Ka-poel, forestalling the answer by holding\nup a hand to Ka-poel and speaking to the officer directly. “No, wait. I don’t\ngive a shit who you are. Tell me why you’re after me. Didn’t Ka-Sedial\nthink the dragonmen were enough?”\n“Dragonmen?” the commander echoed.\n“The ones who’ve been following me. They’re not with you?”\nThe commander let out a hissing breath. “They’re after you? If I had\nknown that, I wouldn’t have bothered.”\n“What do you mean? What do you know of them?”\n“All I know is that six disgraced dragonmen were freed by Ka-Sedial\nafter Landfall fell. They were given the task of assassinating a Fatrastan\nofficer in order to redeem themselves in the eyes of the emperor. That’s all I\nwas told.”\n“So if you’re not with them, who are you?”\nThe sweating intensified again, her eyes flicking from Styke’s face to\nKa-poel and back again. “My name is Lin-Merce,” she said in a low voice.\n“And I’m here because you killed my sister.”\n“You weren’t commanded to come after me?”\n“No. I took my command and deserted the army.”\nStyke paused. Over the years, he’d had plenty of people come after him\nfor revenge. He was, after all, a fairly prolific killer. But he’d never had\nsomeone abandon their post for the express purpose of vengeance. “And the\nconsequences?” he asked.\n“I can never go home.” The voice came out in a whisper. Lin-Merce\nstared into Styke’s eyes with more hatred than he’d ever seen in a human\nbeing, and he was suddenly struck by a rare moment of real compassion.\nShe had given up everything for her vengeance. She had ambushed him; she\nhad crossed swords with him. She’d even managed to outsmart him more\nthan once over the last few weeks. Without Ka-poel’s interference, she\nmight have bounced back and still managed to kill Styke.\nHe could see in her eyes that she knew she was dead. She knew the\npower a bone-eye was capable of, and she clearly knew by now that Ka-\npoel was something special. But that hate was still there. Her whole body\ntrembled as she fought for even a fraction of control so that she could strike\nat the man who’d taken her sister.\nHe wondered if he would feel the same about his own.\n“When did I kill her?” he asked.\n“She was with the cavalry you fought north of Landfall.”\n“When you first landed?”\n“No. After your general fled the city. I was told you ran her down,"

I was told you ran her down,\ntrampling her beneath the feet of your horse like a dog.”\nStyke recalled that battle quite well. Windy River, Flint’s men had called\nit afterward. The Mad Lancers had attempted a flanking move only to run\ninto a superior force doing the same thing. The battle had been brutal, but\nthe lancers had prevailed. “In battle,” Styke said thoughtfully, “we’re all\ndogs.”\n“She was everything to me,” Lin-Merce whispered.\nStyke gave a heavy sigh, walking around Lin-Merce and letting his eyes\nrun over the lines of men sitting obediently, under the thrall of Ka-poel’s\nsorcery. In another life, Lin-Merce might be him. These men might be Mad\nLancers. And Ka-poel might be on the Dynize side.\n“I have more to ask her.” The voice came from Lin-Merce’s mouth, but\nit belonged to Ka-poel.\n“Every moment she lives is agony,” Styke replied. “She doesn’t deserve\nthat.”\n“I don’t care.”\n“I do.” Styke stepped swiftly up behind Lin-Merce and took a solid grip\non her hair. “You’re the only cavalry commander who’s ever gotten the best\nof me,” he said in her ear, before drawing his boz knife across her throat.\nHe pulled, going deep, the metal rasping along her spine, and he held her\nbody as the blood soaked them both, until well after she stopped\nconvulsing. Finally, he lowered her to the ground.\nHe knelt next to the corpse for a few moments before looking up at Ka-\npoel. “Oh, stop glaring at me,” he told her. “You’re like a goddamn child\nplaying with ants compared to these. Either let them go, or let me kill\nthem.”\nThe glaring continued, and Styke stepped over the corpse and\napproached Ka-poel. “I know exactly what kind of a monster I am, but I\ndon’t approve of suffering. You can find your answers from someone else.\nShe earned herself a quick death.” He turned away, then thought better of it\nand swung back around to face Ka-poel. “If you have this kind of power,\nyou should be using it to keep my men alive. You should strike first—not\nwait until we’ve taken such a damned battering. Figure out what you are,\nand be it. But don’t toy with people beneath you, and don’t waste the lives\nof my lancers.”\nHe gave her one last long look and then headed back to camp.\nCHAPTER 49\nM\nichel was unable to stop thinking about how Ichtracia had the softest,\nmost comfortable sheets he’d ever touched in his life.\nHe lay in her bed, staring at the ceiling, watching the late-morning light\nslowly inch across while he tried to focus on the Blackhats. Where was je\nTura hiding? How had he arrested so many Blackhats without a single soul\nknowing where to find that asshole?

        "text": "knowing where to find that asshole? How did je Tura keep conducting these\nbombings?\nThe questions kept running through his head, but he kept coming back to\nIchtracia’s sheets. She said they were some sort of rare silk from Dynize.\nMichel had slept on silk sheets once or twice, and he didn’t remember them\nfeeling anything like this. Even when he rubbed them between his fingers, it\nwas like touching gossamer—ethereal, lacking any kind of substance. Like\nsleeping on the steam from a kettle in that split second after it had cooled\nenough to touch but before it had evaporated.\nHe glanced over at Ichtracia. She, apparently, had no problem sleeping\nuntil noon. She was still snoring softly, her face looking peaceful and\npleased in that way of a child dreaming of something nice. She was, he’d\ndecided, a genuinely pleasant person who happened to be a Privileged.\nMaybe not a good person. She spoke of killing and torture with the\noffhanded manner of someone who is well acquainted with both. But she\nwas quietly charming in a way that almost made Michel forget about the\npair of runed gloves in her breast pocket or next to the bed.\nMichel slipped out of bed and headed to the window to watch the\nafternoon traffic. “You’re letting yourself get distracted because you can’t\nfind the girl,” he muttered to himself, glancing over his shoulder at\nIchtracia’s sleeping form.\n“I’m protecting myself,” he answered.\n“And damn well enjoying it in the meantime.”\n“I can mix work and play,” he insisted under his breath. “I’ve done it\nbefore.”\n“Not when there was this much on the line. You went off the road the\nmoment you decided that punching Forgula in public was a good idea.\nYou’ve become too exposed here—too known.”\nMichel sucked on his teeth, trying to come up with a rebuttal to his own\naccusations. Nothing came to mind. Back when he worked his way up\nthrough the Blackhats as an informant, he’d gone deep into enemy territory\nby joining separatist movements and rubbing shoulders with propagandists\nand gangs. He’d never infiltrated a damned government.\n“Yes, you have.” He laughed at himself quietly. “You’re confusing\nBlackhat Michel with real Michel again. Your whole damn life is an\ninfiltration. Do you think that the Dynize are any more dangerous than the\nBlackhats?” He briefly considered Taniel’s warnings about the bone-eyes,\nbut his thoughts were broken by a soft moan behind him.\nHe turned to find Ichtracia stretching languidly, giving him that cat-in-a-\nsunbeam smile that she seemed to use so often.\n“What are you muttering about over there?” she asked.\n“Work,” he answered truthfully. He continued. “I’m trying to figure out\nwhere je Tura has gone.”\n“You’re very focused.”\n“It’s my job. I’m not allowed to not think about these things.”\nIchtracia sat up, the sheets pooling around her stomach. She reached into\nthe drawer of her nightstand and produced a mala pipe, lighting it expertly\nwith a match and taking a long drag before holding it toward him.\n“This early in the day?” he asked.\nShe let smoke curl out her nostrils. “One advantage to being a tool of the"

Once in a while I am pointed at\nsomething that needs to be destroyed or people who need to die and …”\nShe made a “poof” gesture with one hand, then took another drag of the\nmala and set the pipe aside. Her tone was careless, but Michel thought he\nsaw a tightness in the corner of her eyes.\n“I’m taking your advice to heart,” Michel said. “I’m going to ignore\nSedial and focus on making myself useful to your government.”\n“Our government,” Ichtracia corrected. “Or have you already forgotten\nyour place, Devin-Michel?”\n“Our government,” Michel agreed. “Sorry, it takes some getting used\nto.”\nIchtracia watched him with a soft smile, eyes half-lidded, and for a\nmoment Michel harbored a fear that she could see through him into his\nsecrets—that she’d caught all his tiny verbal mistakes and considered\nulterior motives and already suspected him of being something more than\neither a Blackhat or a turncoat.\nIchtracia patted the bed beside her, and Michel took two involuntary\nsteps forward before his ears caught the sound of a carriage coming to a\nstop in front of the townhouse. He backpedaled to the window and looked\ndown to find a carriage with the red and black curtains of a Dynize\ndignitary. There were a dozen soldiers on horseback surrounding the\ncarriage, and it didn’t take long for Michel to find out why: A footman\nopened the door, and Ka-Sedial stepped out, knuckling his back while the\nfootman ran to Ichtracia’s door.\n“Ka-Sedial is here,” Michel warned, just two seconds before there was a\nhammering down below them.\n“Shit.” Ichtracia stashed the mala pipe and leapt from bed, snatching a\nsilk robe from the floor. She threw it over her shoulders as she joined him at\nthe window, looking down on her grandfather, and Michel was surprised to\nhear real venom in her voice. “I sent the damned servants away so I could\nenjoy you.” The pounding continued, and she swore again. “Stay here, and\ndon’t you dare get dressed.”\nBarefoot and in just a robe, Ichtracia ran from the room. Michel listened\nto her footsteps down the hall and then the stairs. A moment later, he heard\nthe door open underneath the bedroom.\nHe pressed himself against the wall, watching the group in the street\noutside. Sedial’s bodyguard remained in their saddles while the footman\nreturned to Sedial and gave a half bow. Sedial seemed to hesitate, and\nMichel couldn’t help but think that if he had a rifle in hand, he could do\nmore damage to the Dynize with a single bullet from this angle than all the\nwork he could possibly do for Taniel for the rest of his life.\nTo his surprise, a second carriage pulled up behind Ka-Sedial’s.

Taking her arm, cane in the other hand, Sedial walked\ntoward Ichtracia’s door.\nCurious, Michel slipped on his pants and crept into the hallway,\neyeballing the distance between the joists beneath the floorboards in an\neffort to avoid the creakiest parts of the floor. He could hear Sedial and\nIchtracia speaking, but it wasn’t until he was nearly at the top of the stairs\nthat he could hear their conversation well. They spoke in quick-fire Dynize,\nmaking it a little hard for Michel to follow.\n“… not to come here yourself. If you want me, send someone for me,”\nIchtracia was saying.\nSedial’s voice was a little quieter, but there was a tone of irritated\ndismissal in his tone that sounded nothing like his public persona. “I’ll visit\nyou whenever I want. Are you worried I’ll walk in on you with whatever\nslut you’re riding lately?”\nMichel nearly gasped at the strength of the language—he couldn’t\nimagine anyone speaking that way to a Privileged.\nSedial continued. “There’s no one here now, is there?”\n“No, there’s no one here,” Ichtracia spat at her grandfather. “You’re the\none that’s brought a stranger into my home. Who is this?”\nMichel heard someone pacing. It was too slow and deliberate to be\nIchtracia, and the sudden rap of a cane punctuated the footsteps. “I’m\nhearing rumors, Ichtracia, that you’ve taken in that Blackhat spy. I’ll give\nyou one chance to deny them, and all will be forgiven.”\n“Forgiven?” Ichtracia mocked. “You have absolutely no say over who I\ntake into my bed.”\n“I do when they’re enemy spies.”\n“He is a member of Yaret’s Household.”\n“Even worse.”\nIchtracia continued as if Sedial hadn’t interjected. “He’s handed most of\nthe city’s Blackhats over to us in a matter of weeks.”\n“He forced one of my people to commit suicide in public. Forgula was\nvaluable to me.”\nIchtracia barked a laugh, and Michel briefly entertained himself by\nimagining Sedial’s face at being mocked openly. “You’re pissed because he\noutmaneuvered her. Forgula was a bitch, and it was cathartic to finally see\nher get her dues.” Ichtracia paused briefly, lowering her voice. “You were\nusing enemies of the state to destroy your enemies within the state. You\nwould execute anyone else for trying to do the same.”\n“My enemies weaken the state,” Sedial growled, rapping the floor again\nwith his cane. “Clumsy, foolish ministers like Yaret slow down our progress\nhere.”\n“Ministers like Yaret keep the state together.”\n“I am the state!”\nMichel was once again surprised to hear something like that so boldly\nstated, but he’d begun to get the impression that this conversation was a\ncontinuation of many more just like it. He heard Ichtracia give an angry\nsigh. “You’re an old man hoping to leave a legacy of something other than\nblood before death finally claims you.”"

He heard Ichtracia give an angry\nsigh. “You’re an old man hoping to leave a legacy of something other than\nblood before death finally claims you.”\n“You speak as if a legacy of blood is a bad one.” There was a long\nsilence, and Sedial continued in a softer tone. “I didn’t come here to fight.”\n“Then what did you come for?” Ichtracia demanded.\n“I came to tell you that you’re needed down south. We have every\nPrivileged in the city working on the stone, and they’ve made very little\nprogress. Your help is sorely needed.”\nMichel shifted a half step closer to the stairs, listening carefully as the\nvoices lost some of their heat. Ichtracia replied to her grandfather after a\nmoment’s hesitation. “I have told you before, I will not go near that thing.”\n“Even if I give you an order?”\n“You are not the emperor, and the emperor made it very clear that I\nwould not be forced to touch the godstone unless it was absolutely vital.”\n“It is vital.”\nThere was another long pause, and Ichtracia laughed again. It was a\nbitter, venom-filled sound. “You can’t undo what she did, can you?” Sedial\ndid not answer, so she continued. “You have no idea how delicious that is,”\nshe said.\n“Watch your tongue.”\n“Or what, you’ll pack me off to be tortured? I know what pain is, you\nold lizard. I’ve had to stand next to you for more than ten minutes at a time,\nhaven’t I?”\nMichel lay his head against the wall, eyes wide, wondering if Ichtracia\nhad gotten so angry that she forgot Michel was up here. Surely she had to\nknow he’d be listening? Even if he’d stayed in her room, he would have\nheard some of this.\nSedial took a measured breath and finally responded. “We will undo her\nsabotage. It’ll take time, admittedly, but she is not as powerful as she thinks.\nHer sorcery is fumbling and amateurish, and when I catch her, I will teach\nher exactly what a bone-eye is capable of.”\n“Good luck with that.” Ichtracia’s tone told Michel that she wished\nSedial anything but luck.\nAnother measured breath, taken with the long-suffering air of a man\nenduring untold indignity. “It doesn’t have to be like this,” Sedial said.\n“Doesn’t it?”\n“No. You know I love you. You know I’d do anything for my Mara.”\nMichel felt every muscle in his body tense at the name. His breathing\ncame short, and he tried to think. It was a name, he was certain. Wasn’t it?\nA pet name? A reference to something else? It was the first time he’d heard\nthe word used in any way in the Dynize language, and he wondered if\nperhaps he had just misheard a similar word.\nSedial continued. “I brought you a present, just like I did when you were\na little girl.”\nIchtracia snorted, and Michel suddenly remembered the beautiful young\nwoman still standing down there in the room with them. “What is she, a\nslave?”\n“Slave? No, we don’t have slaves in the empire anymore.”"

Surely she’s figuring out\nright about now that you wouldn’t allow her to live after listening to a\nconversation like this. Unless she’s one of your spies, of course.”\n“Oh, come now. I didn’t purchase her. I purchased the enormous debt\nthat she owes some very bad people down in Greenfire Depths. She has\nagreed to be your plaything for as long as you want her around, after which\nyou may send her back to the Depths or set her free or whatever you please.\nShe is just your type, isn’t she?”\n“You think I want a plaything? How old do you think I am?”\n“You always want a plaything. You’ve gone through dozens over the last\nfew years. This one isn’t allowed to talk back to you. I thought you’d find\nthat quite satisfactory.”\n“What’s the catch?” Ichtracia sounded like she was considering this\noffer, and Michel couldn’t quite suppress his horror.\n“Must there be a catch?”\n“I know you better than anyone, you old lizard.”\nSedial gave the amused harrumph of any elderly relative dealing with a\ndifficult child. “Get rid of the Blackhat. Keep this girl as a gift, and I won’t\nforce you to go help with the godstone.”\nThere was another long pause, this one nearly a minute, and Michel\ncould hear someone walking around. He imagined Ichtracia doing a circuit\naround the “offered” woman, examining her like a man might examine a\nnew horse. Ichtracia sniffed. “Do you want me to kill him?”\nMichel’s blood ran cold.\n“I should make you do it yourself for being such a petulant little bitch.\nBut no. Send him back to Yaret. I’ll deal with him myself in time, but until\nthen I don’t need you mocking me by parading him around on your arm at\nthe clubs and games.”\n“I’ll consider it.”\n“You’ll take it.”\n“Until you are my emperor—may all the heavens prevent that from ever\nhappening—I will not follow your orders. I will consider this offer of\nyours.”\n“Give me an answer soon.”\n“Leave the girl.”\nMichel imagined the two staring angrily at each other until Sedial\nsuddenly rapped on the floor twice with his cane and left through the front\ndoor with a stride that seemed far too strong for a man of his age. Michel\nwaited for just a moment before turning to creep back toward the room. He\nwas stopped by the sound of a sigh.\n“Can you talk?” he heard Ichtracia ask.\nA frightened voice answered in Palo. “Yes, ma’am.”\n“Is what he said true? Did he buy your debt?”\n“Yes, ma’am.”\n“That goddamn pig. Don’t flinch away. I’m not going to take you to bed\nor kill you.

He slowly backed away from the stairs, heading back to\nthe bedroom, where he found his shirt and boots and quickly began getting\ndressed.\nHe wanted to ask Ichtracia a thousand questions, but two burning bits of\ninformation kept his heart racing in a near panic: Would she put him out to\nplease her grandfather, and was she this Mara person whom he’d been\nlooking for this whole time?\nHe finished lacing his boots and looked up, only to find Ichtracia\nstanding in the doorway with one arm up on the door, her robe open,\nanother hand on her hip. Her eyes were puffy and red, her mouth turned\ndown at the corners. Michel got to his feet and took a step toward her\nnightstand, with the Privileged’s gloves sitting on them, wondering if she’d\ncome up here to take her anger out on him.\n“How much did you overhear?”\n“Some,” Michel said as innocuously as possible. “It was quite loud.”\nIchtracia sniffed. “You were eavesdropping.” She walked past him\nquickly, but instead of her gloves she retrieved her mala pipe and flung it at\nthe far wall. It shattered, sending bits of glass, ash, and mala across the\nroom. “You’re a damned spy. If you weren’t listening from the top of the\nstairs, I would think less of you. Well, out with it! What do you want to ask?\nAm I going to turn you inside out and hand you to Sedial?” She scoffed and\ncrossed to the window, where she glared out into the street as if to be sure\nSedial was gone. “Do you want to ask why I hate him? Come, I can see the\ndamned question on your lips.”\nMichel tried to work some moisture back into his mouth. “Who is\nMara?”\n“What?” Ichtracia blinked at him, looking genuinely confused. Perhaps\nhe had misheard the word. His inexperience with the language had defeated\nhim, and now he’d asked a question that could arouse her suspicion. Too\ndamn late now.\n“Who is Mara?” he asked again. “I heard Sedial say the name.”\nIchtracia still seemed baffled. This was certainly not the question she’d\nexpected him to voice. “It’s not a name.” Michel’s mind began to turn\nfaster, trying to fit pieces into place in the hope that this new information\nmight help him find Taniel’s informant. Until Ichtracia continued. “It’s not\nexactly a name. I’m Mara. It’s an old word—a pet name that Sedial has\nused for me since I was a little girl.”"

        "text": "exactly a name. I’m Mara. It’s an old word—a pet name that Sedial has\nused for me since I was a little girl.”\nMichel began to pace immediately, the near panic of earlier blowing into\na full panic now. She was Mara. The goddamned nickname of a Privileged,\nand Taniel hadn’t thought that either of those bits of information were\nimportant? Did he think that leaving out the Privileged bit was the only way\nto convince Michel to take the job? That otherwise Michel would have\ngotten out of the city as fast as his feet could carry him?\nBecause he was damned well right.\n“Why do you want to know about that name?” Ichtracia asked, taking a\nstep toward him.\nMichel took the same step back, edging toward the door. He’d spent\nthree days with her now, and he suddenly didn’t recognize her anymore. It\nterrified him almost as much as those gloves sitting on the nightstand. “I\nhave to go.”\n“What? No. Answer my question.”\nMichel glanced at the gloves, then at Ichtracia’s face. “Yaret needs me\nright now,” he said with more confidence than he felt, heading for the front\ndoor.\nCHAPTER 50\nI\nt took a day to set up the duel. Vlora stayed in a back room of Burt’s\nbrothel, nursing the cuts on her hands and only leaving once, to send a\nsecure courier to Olem with instructions to inch the army closer to Yellow\nCreek.\nThe morning brought a cold wind sweeping down from the mountains,\nchilling Vlora through her clothes as she stepped outside with an entourage\nthat included Burt and fifty of his armed posse. Most of them were Palo, but\nmore than a few were Kressian or Gurlish. The sun wasn’t even above the\ntrees yet, and traffic was sparse. Children lined the rooftops, watching them\npass, and Vlora guessed that word about this duel had spread.\nThey walked down the main road, passing the hotel where Vlora had\nspent the first week of her stay. The fidgety manager stood on the stoop,\neyes glued to the procession. They kept onward, finally turning off the\nstreet and entering a dusty park, where a public gallows stood ominously\ncreaking in the wind. The corner of the park was full of tombstones.\nMen and women lined the other side of the park, all of them similarly\nwell armed, and they outnumbered Burt’s people by at least a dozen. Nohan\nstood at the center of the group beside a dark-skinned Deliv woman in a\ncorseted crimson dress. She was dressed more like a courtesan at a dinner\nparty than someone out early in the morning to watch two people fight to\nthe death.\nVlora leaned over to Burt. “Is that Jezzy in the red dress?” she asked.\n“That’s her.” Burt puffed on a cigar. He wore a dashing brown suit,\ncomplete with cane and bowler cap, and he, too, seemed to be treating this\nas a matter of entertainment rather than dire consequence.\n“Does she know what I am?”\nBurt grinned around his cigar. “She has no idea. She bet her best gold\nmine against seven of my smaller claims without batting an eye. Either she"

        "text": "“Does she know what I am?”\nBurt grinned around his cigar. “She has no idea. She bet her best gold\nmine against seven of my smaller claims without batting an eye. Either she\nknows something I don’t, or she doesn’t know that I know her man is a\nmage.” He looked skyward, as if making sure the order of the sentence\nsounded right, then nodded to himself. “Whoever wins, this is going to be a\nlot more interesting than she expects.”\nSo Burt was betting against the house. It didn’t surprise Vlora, not\nmuch, but she was slightly annoyed at how cavalier he was about this thing.\nHe might lose a handful of small claims, but she could be dead in ten\nminutes.\nVlora eyed the armed men. “Is this going to turn into a battle?”\n“It shouldn’t. The deputies are steering clear this morning, but nobody\nwants a real confrontation. This is just a bit of fun.”\n“And all the weapons?”\n“Precaution.”\nVlora eyed Nohan. He didn’t look great. He still limped from their\ntussle, and his arms seemed stiff. He didn’t look like he’d gotten much\nmore sleep than she had—probably he’d been out hunting her each of the\nlast few nights. She had little question that he was running a damned\npowerful powder trance.\nVlora was confident, but she knew that being too confident could get her\nkilled. This was a trained powder mage who delighted in killing. He was\nbigger, stronger, and just as fast. Even if she won, she was unlikely to leave\nthis fight unscathed.\nShe tested the tightness of the stitches Burt’s surgeon had redone on her\narms, knowing that she’d probably rip them all out. Taking a powder charge\nbetween her fingers, she crushed the paper and reached up her sleeve to rub\nthe powder beneath her bandages, feeling the fire as it reached her\nbloodstream. She took another charge and sniffed it, turning away from the\nothers lest Jezzy see the act and try to cancel the duel.\nShe had Nohan out in the open. This had to end now.\nBurt checked his pocket watch, then twirled it on the end of its chain.\n“It’s time, ma’am,” he told Vlora.\n“Agreed.”\nShe and Burt went to the middle of the park, where they were soon\njoined by Jezzy and Nohan. Jezzy gave them both a toothy, charming smile.\n“My friends,” she began.\n“Can it, Jezzy,” Burt replied pleasantly. “This is the woman you tried to\nhave killed when she wouldn’t work with you.”\nJezzy lifted her chin, looking down her nose at Vlora. “Is that so? The\none whose friend killed poor Dorner? Pity, that. Dorner was always a loyal\ndog. Does your champion have a name?”\n“Verundish,” Vlora answered.\n“Verundish.” Jezzy rolled the name around on her tongue. “Nohan says\nhe knows you. Is that true?”\n“We have a history.”\nJezzy’s smile broadened. “I’m glad we’re here to let you work out your\nproblems. Do you know what Nohan is, little lady? He’s a powder mage."

He’s a powder mage.\nYou sure you want to fight him?” Jezzy scrunched up her face, wiggling her\nnose, her eyes smiling.\n“Powder mages are all fluff,” Vlora said, staring at Nohan. The bastard\nhadn’t even warned his boss what he was up against. What a weaseling\nasshole.\n“If you insist,” Jezzy said. “Now, then, Burt. Are we agreed on the\nterms?”\n“Your mine. My claims. Straight out bet with Kresimir and all gathered\nas my witness.”\nJezzy’s eyes flicked up to the armed men Burt had brought with him.\n“And no funny business?”\n“None coming from me.” Burt puffed on his cigar, then extended his\nhand. The two shook. He leaned over to Vlora. “Don’t make me a poorer\nman, Lady Flint,” he whispered. Then he retreated back to the other side of\nthe park.\nIt was the first time he’d outright stated that he knew who she was.\nVlora tried not to let it bother her, watching as Jezzy retreated as well,\nleaving Vlora and Nohan alone. She couldn’t sense any powder on him, and\nhad left hers with Burt. She wanted to focus on this without having to worry\nabout him trying to detonate her powder, and he’d obviously felt the same.\n“Just a couple of powder mages,” Vlora said. “High as Gurlish\nsandriders with a pair of swords between them. This should be fun, don’t\nyou think?”\nNohan glared at her. “I’m not here for fun. I’m here to win back my\npride.”\n“I’m not sure you had any to begin with,” Vlora said, drawing her\nsword. Her mentor had always taught her to kill in cold blood—to set aside\nthe quips and the insults and to let her sword talk for her. Vlora, however,\nwas not Tamas. “You’re an asshole, Nohan. You should just have accepted it\nand tried to rein in your lust for blood. You would have gotten a lot farther\nin life.”\n“What, working in your damned cabal?”\n“You wanted to at one point. Now you’re a bitter sword for hire, and\nyou’ve been coaxed into a duel instead of sitting back and shooting at me\nfrom the other side of town. It was a good strategy. You should have stuck\nto it.”\n“You sure it was me who walked into a trap?” Nohan demanded.\nVlora let her eyes travel along the men standing on the other side of the\npark, then to the rooftops, wondering if perhaps she’d made an error. Was\nNohan cleverer than she expected? Had he set her up? Or was this a last bit\nof bravado to throw her off her feet?\n“Good-bye, Nohan,” Vlora said, stepping forward.\nAudible gasps rose from the watchers as the two crossed swords.

        "text": "Audible gasps rose from the watchers as the two crossed swords. Nohan\nleapt to the offensive, driving Vlora back with a series of thrusts that were\nalmost too fast for the eye to follow. Vlora allowed herself to relax, drawing\non instinct to parry and riposte, keeping her footing steady as she backed\naway. Their blades blurred in the morning sunlight, and dust rose around\nthem from their footwork.\nShe continued to fall back. Letting an opponent tire themselves out was\na time-honored dueling strategy, but that wouldn’t work on a powder mage.\nAt least, not very quickly. But she could let his fury build, keeping him at\nbay without striking back, and that’s what she did as they circled the park.\nWithin moments she could hear mutters, and someone said the words\n“powder mage.” Bets were soon being shouted back and forth as the big\nbosses’ underlings worked themselves into a frenzy.\nVlora parried a particularly powerful strike and was immediately forced\nto duck below a swing and throw herself to one side. Sweat began to pour\ndown her face, and she focused harder.\nNohan managed to get inside her guard, nicking her right forearm. She\nanswered by cutting off the tip of his nose, causing him to stumble back\namid a flurry of curses. She followed him coldly, suddenly on the attack,\nmoving with purpose.\nHe managed to parry several strikes in a row, but then she was inside his\nguard. She stabbed his right shoulder, parried a riposte, and stabbed him\njust below the ribs. His sword arm faltered, and she stepped forward and\ncaught him by the front of his jacket, thrusting her sword through his heart\nuntil her hilt touched his chest.\nShe held him up, his body twitching, his eyes rolling as he died. After a\nfew moments she pulled out her sword and let him fall.\nThe cheers, jeers, and bets quieted. The dust slowly settled. Vlora turned\nto Burt, who held his cigar between his teeth with a grin. His cigar was no\nshorter. The fight had lasted thirty seconds—maybe less. She turned to\nJezzy, whose face was ashen, her broad smile gone. Jezzy took two steps\ntoward Vlora, then stopped, hawking a wad of phlegm at her champion.\n“You cheated,” Jezzy spat.\nThe assembled crowd immediately erupted into chaos. Accusations flew\nfrom both sides. Burt held his arms up in alarm, shouting, “No!” over and\nover again, while muskets, blunderbusses, and swords were shaken angrily\non all sides. Vlora whirled, her head spinning, her thoughts hard to focus\nafter the euphoric adrenaline of the fight.\n“Nobody cheated,” she said to Jezzy. “Your man lost. Pay up to Burt, or\neveryone here will see you for a coward.” She turned back to Burt, hoping\nhe’d back her up, when she heard a musket shot.\nMost people assumed that powder mages were infallible when it came to\nblack powder, that they could stop every powder ignition and that any bullet\nthat managed to fly would somehow miss them. This was, of course, a myth\nthat Vlora had been disabused of from an early age. Any powder mage"

Any powder mage\ncould be shot—all you had to do was overwhelm them, confuse them, or\njust take them by surprise.\nShe felt the bullet hit her in the back a fraction of a second after she\nheard the blast. She stumbled forward, falling to her knees, watching the\nsurprise spread on Burt’s face. Burt suddenly leapt for the ground, and the\nworld erupted in violence as both sides opened fire. Bullets whizzed over\nand around Vlora, a soft undertone to the cacophony of powder blasts and\nmen screaming.\nVlora struggled to open the button on the breast pocket of her jacket,\nonly to remember that there was no powder inside. Her head was fuzzy, her\nthoughts confused. She felt a burning between her shoulder blades that she\ncould not ignore.\nAll around her, men and women died. Weapons were fired, and it\nquickly became apparent that both sides had stationed people on the roof.\nThe exchange grew more frenzied and wild, and Vlora forced herself to her\nfeet and began to walk.\nIn the chaos and the dust and powder smoke, it was difficult to tell who\nwas shooting at whom. She reached out with her senses toward the armed\ngang behind her, where Jezzy was being protected by her men, and\ndetonated their powder with a thought. The kickback from touching off over\nthree dozen sources of powder at once nearly caused her to pass out, but she\npushed on until she fell on her knees beside Burt.\nBurt seemed unharmed. He held his hands over his head, cigar crushed\nin the dust and cane lost as he pressed his face against the ground. She\nforcibly turned him over, searching his pockets for her spare powder\ncartridges and shoving them into her own jacket.\n“Remember our deal,” she growled, regaining her feet.\nShe detonated the powder of a trio of armed women on a roof across the\nstreet, ripping them—and the building on which they stood—in half. The\nexchange of gunfire continued, and Vlora wondered just how many men\nboth sides had brought with them. Her ears ringing, she could make out\ngunfire from all over, extending well into the streets.\nBoth of these fools had brought their entire private armies with them.\nShe limped away from the park, back the way they’d come down the\nmain street, snorting powder to quell the pain between her shoulders. She\nassessed the damage; her chest and the muscles of her back were tight,\nevery step causing a spike of pain to bleed through her powder trance. She\ncould still move her arms—though not as well. It would have to be good\nenough.\nThe acrid smell of smoke caught her attention, and she knew\nimmediately that it was not powder smoke. There was a fire somewhere\nbehind her, maybe even set by her own detonations, and she thought of all\nthe slapdash wooden buildings crammed in together in the valley. Fire\nwould spread damned fast. She redoubled her efforts.\nThe streets were full of people screaming and running. Vlora was jostled\nand shoved, but otherwise ignored. Some people ran away from the\nfirefight; others called for a bucket brigade and ran toward the flames."

        "text": "The streets were full of people screaming and running. Vlora was jostled\nand shoved, but otherwise ignored. Some people ran away from the\nfirefight; others called for a bucket brigade and ran toward the flames.\nShe reached Burt’s brothel, fetched her pistol from Burt’s office, and\nthen went for her horse in his stable. A curious stable boy saddled the\nanimal for a handful of pennies, while Vlora rested on a hay bale in the\ncorner. Blood dripped down both arms, and when she finally regained her\nfeet, the hay was crimson. It took the stable boy’s help to get her into the\nsaddle.\nVlora rode out of town, slumped in the saddle, trying to get as far away\nfrom the fighting as possible. This wasn’t her war—this wasn’t why she\nwas here. She drifted in and out of consciousness, barely holding together\nenough to direct her horse up the road leading to Little Flerring’s\ncompound.\n“What the pit is going on?” Little Flerring demanded from her vantage\npoint above her cabin. Vlora tried to answer as she attempted to dismount,\nand only managed to slip from the saddle and fall to the ground in a heap.\nThe last thing she remembered was hands lifting her toward the sky.\nCHAPTER 51\nT\nhe Mad Lancers left the Hock—and the remnants of their dragoon rivals\n—and soon reached the coast. They skirted the city-fortress of New\nStarlight late in the evening, using a sunken road to slip by undetected. It\nwasn’t until they were well past that Styke allowed himself to circle around\nthe end of his army and gaze back upon the city, squinting through the\nfading light at Dynize flags flying from the turrets that had once flown the\nflag of the Fatrastan Army.\nThe city-fortress was not like anything else in Fatrasta. It was built on a\nwedge of land jutting off the northwest edge of the Hammer and guarded by\na sloped curtain wall that cut the entire wedge off from the mainland and\nhoused a small city—enough space for around ten thousand people. Inside\nthat was the fortress itself, a towering knife of white stone, freckled with\nred, surrounded by seven mighty turrets, the largest of which was topped\nwith an enormous lighthouse to warn incoming ships of the rocks below.\n“Is that a castle?”\nStyke turned to find Celine beside him, gently patting Margo on the\nneck. He sized up New Starlight, realizing that it looked far more like a\nstorybook castle than it did the palisades or star-forts that dotted Fatrasta. “I\nsuppose it is,” he said. It wasn’t a pretty castle, not by a long shot, but it had\nall the trappings of one.\n“Who built it?”\n“A Starlish duke,” he told Celine. “He was one of the first serious\nexplorers to cross through the heart of Fatrasta, and when he reached here,\nhe enslaved the local Palo and made them build him this fortress. I think\nthat was, eh, three hundred years ago?”\nCeline’s eyes widened. “It’s stood that long?”\n“There are older castles in the Nine, but it’s a decent enough fortress.”"

        "text": "that was, eh, three hundred years ago?”\nCeline’s eyes widened. “It’s stood that long?”\n“There are older castles in the Nine, but it’s a decent enough fortress.”\nHe pointed to the turrets. “Those are big enough to hold modern cannons,\nand the wall is sloped slightly, which helps take a pounding from straight-\nshot.”\n“Then why do the Dynize hold it?” she asked. “There’s no sign of a\nbattle.”\nStyke frowned at the fortress. She was right; there were no signs of a\nbattle. The walls were undamaged, all of the turrets standing. “Sharp eyes.”\nHe pondered the question for a few moments. “The garrison must have\nabandoned it at the first sight of the enemy. Maybe when they heard about\nLandfall. Damned cowards.” He resisted the urge to take a closer look.\nEven a poor garrison could have held New Starlight against an enemy siege\n—those towers would make short work of just about any fleet attempting a\nblockade.\nBut New Starlight wasn’t his problem.\nAs they watched, a small, mounted force exited the curtain wall and\nrode east. Definitely Dynize soldiers. Styke remained until the sun was\nalmost gone, searching the horizon for any signs of those dragonmen before\nturning Amrec to catch up with the Mad Lancers. Celine followed in his\nwake.\nTheir camp was a few miles south of New Starlight in a gentle valley\nlarge enough to hold most of their army but small enough for a scout to\nmiss until they were right on top of it. As Styke and Celine rode in, the men\nwere just beginning to set up their tents, and Styke proceeded to the other\nside of the camp, where he found Ibana, Ka-poel, Gustar, and a dozen Mad\nLancers gathered around an opening in the hillside.\nThe opening had, until a few minutes ago, been hidden behind a boulder.\nThe entrance was squat—no more than three feet by three feet—and held\ntogether by thick-cut timbers. It looked like the entrance to a tiny mine.\nStyke handed Amrec off to a nearby soldier and joined Ibana. “Is it still\nintact?” he asked.\n“We’re finding out,” she answered without looking away from the\nentrance.\nGustar knelt by the timbers, squinting into the dark hole, a half smile on\nhis face. “A Blackhat cache, buried under a hill in the middle of nowhere.”\nHe shook his head. “How many people even know about this?”\n“Five or ten,” Styke said, kneeling next to Gustar and peering into the\ndarkness. He could see a light, somewhere in the depths, bobbing around.\n“Lindet uses forced labor for this kind of thing so that word won’t get out to\nthe general public.”\n“What’s it for?” Gustar asked.\n“This,” Styke grunted with a gesture toward their camp. “Lindet is a\nfirm believer in being ready for anything. In addition to regular supply\ndepots, she’s got these caches hidden away all over the country—mostly in\nthe less-populated areas. They’re specifically meant to resupply an army. If\nthis one is untouched, it’ll provide us with canned food, wine, ammunition,\nand spare weapons to last weeks.”"

If\nthis one is untouched, it’ll provide us with canned food, wine, ammunition,\nand spare weapons to last weeks.”\nAs if to answer the next unspoken question, the bobbing of the light\nsuddenly came toward them, growing until the lantern was set aside and\nJackal’s head and shoulders emerged from the pit. Jackal grinned up at\nthem. “Everything is there,” he reported.\nIbana clapped her hands together. Styke couldn’t blame her. They\nneeded a bit of good luck after the last couple weeks of hard riding and\nfighting.\n“Check the tins and barrels,” Ibana ordered. “If the rats haven’t gotten to\nany of it, give everyone a double ration of food and wine tonight.”\n“No drunks,” Styke added.\n“No drunks,” Ibana agreed.\nStyke got out of the way to let them work, and soon Jackal was\noverseeing a chain of men rolling out barrels and handing up crates to\nempty the deep cache. He watched them work for a few minutes, feeling\nsuddenly tired from the events of the last few weeks. His body reminded\nhim that he was no longer the Mad Ben Styke who could go a week without\nsleep and still fight a battle.\nLooking around, his eyes fell on Ka-poel sitting on the hillside above the\nentrance to the cache. He was surprised to find her watching him, and when\ntheir eyes met, she got to her feet and walked away into the darkness.\nStyke snorted. He still couldn’t decide what he thought about what had\nhappened last night. Walking into the Dynize cavalry camp unopposed,\nseeing all of those soldiers sitting cross-legged like they were waiting for a\nmummers’ show in the park, unable to move or speak. The officer whom\nKa-poel used as a mouthpiece. The memory floated in the back of his head\nlike a bad dream, fuzzy on details, and he briefly wondered if he had\ndreamt it.\nHe continued to watch his lancers as they unloaded the cache for several\nminutes before confiscating one of their lanterns. He found Celine brushing\ndown Margo with Sunin’s help. “Finish that and come with me,” he told\nher.\nThey walked into the darkness, lantern held high above Styke’s head.\nStyke followed the coppery smell of blood sorcery, sniffing at the air every\nfew moments until they found Ka-poel at the top of the valley, sitting on the\nground with the contents of her satchel spread out across a rock. There was\nwax, bits of hair, tiny figurines, and sticks, dirt, and even some fingernails.\nIt reminded him of the sort of non sequitur items his little sister used to\ncollect as a child.\nStyke set the lantern on the rock and sat down across from her, watching\nher face. She lifted her eyes to him for a brief second and squinted before\nreturning her attention to a half-made wax figurine in her lap.\nStyke patted his knee, letting Celine sit, then addressed Ka-poel. “What\ndid you do with the Dynize cavalry yesterday?”\nKa-poel continued her work, finishing the figurine and gently pressing a\ndirty toenail into the soft wax, before brushing off her hands and lifting her"

She drew her thumb across her neck,\nthen flashed several more signs.\n“I killed them,” Celine translated. “Just like you asked.”\n“Why did you keep them as long as you did? Why didn’t you finish\nthem sooner?”\n“I told you. I needed answers.” Ka-poel raised her chin, as if daring him\nto continue that line of questioning.\nSo he did. “And?” He drummed his fingers on the rock, looking over her\nassortment of disgusting knickknacks.\nKa-poel stared at him, her hands folded in her lap, before finally lifting\nthem into the light of the lantern. “I have been trying to uncover my past,”\nCeline translated. “When I was a child, my nurse took me from Dynize. I\nremember very little of that time—I remember a palace, and great halls, and\nI remember fleeing through the night and across the ocean in a small ship\nmanned by sailors who knew they would die.”\nKa-poel’s eyes took on a faraway glint, her brow wrinkling with the\ntelling. She continued. “My nurse took me into the swamp, and we joined\none of the tribes there. She died very soon after from disease. Her death\ndeprived me of my own history, and I have wondered who I am for over\ntwo decades.”\n“So who are you?” Styke asked. Her look was guarded, and he knew\nthat pushing too hard on a subject like this was likely to make a person\nbutton up for good. But he was still angry about the things he saw last night,\nand he didn’t have the patience to be gentle.\nKa-poel waggled her finger, as if to say, My story isn’t done. She\ncontinued. “My nurse sang me songs. I remember those. She called me a\nprincess, and I always thought that was …” Celine struggled with the sign\nKa-poel made, her small face scrunching in confusion.\n“Hyperbole?” Styke suggested.\nKa-poel nodded. “I thought it was hyperbole. When the Dynize came, I\nhad reason to suspect that perhaps … perhaps that wasn’t the case.”\nStyke gently smoothed Celine’s hair, watching Ka-poel’s face carefully.\nShe was normally stoic, sometimes bemused or playful. But she seemed\ngenuinely troubled right now, and that set him on edge. She was too\npowerful to be troubled.\n“A bone-eye has been calling to me,” Ka-poel finally finished.\n“What do you mean, ‘calling to you’?” Styke asked, feeling goose\nbumps on the back of his arm.\n“Sorcery,” Ka-poel clarified.\n“I gathered as much. But how? Does he know where you are? Is he able\nto track us?”\nKa-poel hesitated. “I don’t know. I don’t think so. But I was never\ntrained in what I do, so there are many simple things that the Dynize bone-\neyes are capable of that I am unaware of. So … maybe.”\nThat didn’t make Styke happy.

        "text": "eyes are capable of that I am unaware of. So … maybe.”\nThat didn’t make Styke happy. Not even a little bit. Having someone\nlike Ka-poel around—someone so powerful that they could take physical\ncontrol of a company of cavalry—and have her admit that she had not\nmastered simple parts of her own sorcery was not only disconcerting, it was\nalso downright dangerous.\n“I have figured out,” she said, “that this bone-eye can only call to me\nthrough shared blood.” She paused. “Those lancers—well, their officers—I\nwas asking them about the powerful bone-eyes who came over with the\ninvasion.”\n“And what did you discover?”\n“I am being called by an old man. His name is Ka-Sedial, and he was the\none who came to meet your sister the day before their invasion.”\nStyke was on his feet before he knew it, towering over Ka-poel, fists\nclenched. “Be very careful what you say next,” he said through clenched\nteeth. He could feel his heart hammering in his chest. The very idea that\nsomeone would discover that he and Lindet were brother and sister had\nnever even occurred to him. Only they knew the secret, and neither was\nabout to tell a soul.\nHis leap had sent Celine tumbling, and without taking his eyes off Ka-\npoel, he helped her to her feet and gestured for her to watch Ka-poel’s\nhands.\n“Sit down,” Celine translated Ka-poel’s next signs. “Blood is my\nbusiness. You can’t hide your relation from me.” She sniffed, as if the smell\nof imminent violence coming from Styke was nothing more than an\ninconvenience. “I will keep your secret.”\nSlowly, Styke lowered himself to the ground.\n“This is an exchange,” Ka-poel said. “Do you understand? I keep your\nsecret, and you will keep mine.”\nStyke tried to calm his pounding heart, remembering the conversation\nbefore his sister was mentioned. “This Ka-Sedial?”\n“Yes. He is my grandfather.”\n“And what does that make you?”\nKa-poel smiled distantly, laughing to herself. “It makes me a princess.\nThe Dynize emperor is my cousin.”\nStyke almost laughed himself. A damned princess, riding along with\nhim. It seemed like something out of a fairy tale, yet so much of this already\ndid. He wondered if it explained her power—if the Dynize royal family was\nstronger than most. “Why is he calling to you?”\n“He is trying to be …” Celine struggled with the next word, and Ka-poel\nhad to spell it out in signs. “Paternalistic.”\n“What does that mean?” Celine asked Styke.\n“It means he’s trying to be fatherly. Reaching out for a lost\ngranddaughter.” Styke didn’t take his eyes off Ka-poel. “Are you\nanswering?”\n“I am not,” Ka-poel said. “I may, tentatively, but I’m not sure if that will\nreveal our position. He knows who I am—he knows that I am that girl\nstolen away so long ago. But I don’t know why my nurse stole me away.\nShe took me for a reason, and I want to discover why. But if I ask him, he\nwill lie.”\n“How do you know?”"

He\ndoes not know my power. I can see through his intentions like a pane of\nglass, and I know he wishes to use me.”\nStyke grunted. “I don’t mind being used, but never against my will.”\n“I am of a similar mind,” Ka-poel acknowledged.\nStyke lifted his head, looking down the valley toward the soldiers\nunloading the cache. It was late, and he knew he needed to rest if they were\ngoing to ride all day tomorrow. “This thing,” he said, changing directions\nand gesturing to the wax figurines and bits of detritus on the rock, “I\nsuggest that you learn some … restraint. There is no reason to torture\npeople at length.”\n“They feel no pain unless I make them,” Ka-poel said, frowning.\n“Physical, perhaps. But emotional? I looked into that woman’s eyes. She\nknew she was being controlled and she tried with every fiber of her being to\nfight it. If you must do that to people, make it short. Suffering is needless.”\n“I had cause.”\n“We all have cause,” Styke said with a shrug. “This bone-eye, Ka-\nSedial. What will you do with him?”\nKa-poel looked down at the camp herself, her frown deepening. “I will\nlet him croon over the distance. I will let him wonder what I am up to. And\nin the next few days, I will find the godstone that he seeks and I will break\nit. Only then will I answer him, and I’ll allow him to know what I have\ndone.” She smiled, an expression neither bemused nor playful. “Then I will\ndemand that he explain why my nurse—a woman who loved me—felt the\nneed to carry me off so long ago.” Ka-poel’s attention returned to the\ndetritus spread in front of her, clearly a dismissal.\nStyke left her with her figurines and headed back to camp deep in his\nown thoughts. Celine rode on his shoulder, clearly lost in thoughts of her\nown. “Do you understand never to speak of what you heard back there?” he\nasked.\n“Yes,” Celine responded. “I’m no snitch.”\nWell, at least her dad had taught her something. “Good. If you have\nquestions, you may ask. But only when we are completely alone.” He took\nher back to Margo and Sunin, then found Amrec and began the mechanical\nwork of brushing him down for the night. He thought of Ka-poel’s\nexpression during their conversation, and of his own search for vengeance\nthese past few weeks. He wondered if she had difficulty, trapped in her own\nbody without a voice, unable to communicate beyond a bit of slate and a\nlittle girl’s translations.\nHe finished his work and prepared for sleep. They would find this\ngodstone soon, and it would be her work to destroy or disable the damned\nthing. And then, it seemed, she had questions of her own to answer.\nSorcery had never scared him.

He spent\nthe night drinking at one of the few bars left in the city where he was fairly\ncertain he wouldn’t run into either a Blackhat or a Dynize; then the next\nmorning he went to Yaret’s new residence in the old bank. He stood outside,\nwishing he was still buried in a bottle of whiskey before running a hand\nthrough his hair and straightening the collar of his jacket.\nWhatever was going on with Sedial, Ichtracia, or anyone else, Michel\nneeded to finish what he’d started here in Landfall. Eliminating the\nBlackhats to the last man would make his chances of survival go up, so\neliminate them he must. He held a large valise that he’d fetched less than an\nhour ago, and opened it once more to confirm the contents before heading\ninside.\nHe found Yaret and Tenik in deep conference in Yaret’s office. Both men\nlooked up as Michel entered.\n“You look like you got hit by a carriage,” Yaret said.\nTenik sniffed. “And you smell like a brewery. I know where je Tura is\nhiding.”\n“Oh?” Yaret asked.\nMichel went to Yaret’s desk, clearing off the papers into a messy stack\nand tossing them on a chair before opening the valise and producing an\narmload of two-foot-long cylinders. He opened one at random, discarded it,\nthen another before producing a large roll of paper that he spread out across\nYaret’s desk.\n“What are these?” Tenik asked.\n“Maps of the catacombs beneath Landfall.”\nThe two men stared at the paper in stunned silence. “Why haven’t we\nbeen using these all along?”\n“Because I didn’t know they existed. The thought struck me at about\nfour o’clock in the morning—Lindet was as good at keeping records as you,\nmaybe even better. There are hundreds of miles of natural and man-made\ncatacombs in the plateau. Most of the larger tunnels were sealed off decades\nago, but there are plenty of entrances around the city.”\n“Yes, we know. We’ve been searching the damned things and haven’t\nfound anything.”\nMichel held up one finger. “I had two thoughts. One, that Lindet would\nhave mapped those catacombs and stashed the maps in the Millinery library.\nThey weren’t important enough to take along, so they would have been left\nbehind. It took me less than an hour to find them once I realized.”\nTenik swore.\n“My thoughts exactly. My second thought was that we’ve been looking\nfor an operation—dozens of men moving around supplies and powder and\nsleeping in the catacombs and all that.”\n“Right,” Tenik responded. “And again, we haven’t found any sign of\nthat.”\nMichel leaned over the table toward Tenik and Yaret. “But we’re not\nlooking for dozens of men. What if it’s just je Tura? Maybe two or three\nothers at the most?”\n“There’s no possible way he could have conducted all these bombings\nwithout serious help,” Yaret protested. “He blew up my house!”"

Plenty of places in the city\nhave them. Shopkeepers use them for storage. If je Tura is moving through\nthose tunnels—if he has maps like these, or a seriously good guide—he\ncould evade our soldiers indefinitely. Think about it. We would easily find\nevidence of dozens of men down there, but if he’s carrying no more than a\nbedroll, a pack, and a lantern, he’ll leave absolutely no sign of his passing.”\n“And the powder?”\n“An off-the-books cache? A forgotten storehouse? I haven’t met je Tura,\nbut I’ve heard rumors that he’s a strong son of a bitch. He could carry\naround a couple of barrels of gunpowder himself—certainly enough to set\nup in your basement.”\nYaret snorted in disbelief. “You’re telling me that hundreds of Dynize\nsoldiers are being foiled by the work of one man?”\n“With all the evidence—or lack thereof—it’s the only solution we have\nleft.”\nTenik rubbed the back of his head, staring at the maps, looking as\nirritated as Michel felt. “So what do we do? He went off the schedule he\narranged with Forgula the moment Forgula wound up dead. He’s striking at\nrandom throughout the city. Do we just hope we get lucky?”\n“Not a chance.” Michel tapped on the map he’d rolled out. “We go in\nafter him.”\n“But we’ve tried!” Yaret said in frustration. “We can’t find him.”\n“We have maps now. We start at one entrance, we take in a thousand\nmen, and we flush the bastard out like we would rats in a basement. At the\nvery least we might be able to find his damned cache of powder. But if\nwe’re lucky, we corner him and catch him.”\nYaret pursed his lips. “Four thousand.”\n“Eh?” Michel asked.\n“Four thousand men. These tunnels are extensive and layered atop each\nother. I want at least four thousand men all searching them at once. A full-\non manhunt.”\n“Damn,” Tenik breathed. “We can’t possibly …”\n“We’ll have to ask Sedial for manpower,” Yaret said. Michel could see\nin his eyes that he was on board and determined. Only Tenik seemed\nskeptical.\n“We can’t trust Sedial’s people,” Tenik said in a hushed voice, as if\nSedial himself were listening. “He won’t want je Tura brought to light, lest\nhe confirm that he was working for Sedial indirectly this whole time. It’s\nanother loose end.”\n“Then assure Sedial that we’re hunting for the kill,” Michel said\ndispassionately. “There aren’t more than a handful of Blackhats left in the\ncity. We can afford to shoot to kill when it comes to je Tura, and if Sedial\nthinks that evidence will die with him, then he’ll give his help.”\n“And we lose a bargaining chip against Sedial,” Tenik said unhappily."

Yaret?”\n“You have my full authority,” Yaret said. “Begin the hunt first thing\ntomorrow. Get Sedial’s help. Requisition every lantern in the city, and have\nour cartographers begin making copies of these maps. Go!”\nTenik was gone without a word, leaving Michel alone with Yaret.\nWithout waiting to be asked, Michel sank into Tenik’s chair with a sigh, a\nsudden headache appearing where his post-realization adrenaline rush had\noccupied his mind over the last few hours. He rubbed his eyes, wishing a\npox upon all hangovers, and put his head down between his knees.\n“You look in rough shape,” Yaret said kindly.\nMichel looked up. It was not a comment he expected from a superior.\n“Stressful day yesterday,” he said, hoping it ended the conversation. He\ndidn’t want to explain the sudden conflict he had with Ichtracia, or the fact\nthat he’d been eavesdropping on Sedial—though, to be honest, Yaret would\nprobably enjoy the latter.\nYaret picked something off his shirt. “I, uh, heard you’ve been spending\nquite a lot of time with Saen-Ichtracia lately.”\nMichel hesitated a moment before answering. “She saved my life.”\n“And you show your gratitude by plowing her senseless for three days?”\nYaret shook his head, then waved a hand at Michel to forestall a reply. “No,\nno. Don’t explain yourself. That actually makes far too much sense when it\ncomes to a Privileged. Forgive my crassness as well. Frankly, I’m more\nthan a little delighted by hearing that someone Sedial hates has found his\nway into Ichtracia’s bed, but I do like you, Michel, and so I think you\nshould be warned.”\n“About the dangers of sleeping with a Privileged?” Michel asked,\nadopting a pained expression. “I’m not entirely ignorant.”\nYaret’s half smile disappeared, replaced by a serious look of concern.\n“No, by sleeping with Ichtracia. Not because of Sedial,” he added quickly.\n“At least, not directly.” Yaret shifted in his chair and sighed. “I won’t insult\nyou by explaining why we’re here. The godstone, all of that. As a high-level\nBlackhat, I assume you know.”\n“I know a bit,” Michel said slowly, wondering where this was going. “I\nknow the godstone’s purpose and that you want it. Not why you want it.”\n“Sedial ended our civil war by killing the rival emperor and then\npromising to reconcile both sides by creating a new god. That’s why we’re\nhere. To bring peace to our country, we must resurrect the god that died to\nstart our civil war. It was the only proposal that we could all agree on, so we\nspent well over a decade preparing to invade Fatrasta and seize the stones.”\n“What does this have to do with Ichtracia?”\n“I’m getting to that. This was all Sedial’s plan—his grand proposal."

This was all Sedial’s plan—his grand proposal.\nMany think of him as a great man for ending the civil war.”\n“And?”\n“Ichtracia does not think he is a great man. When she was just a child,\nshe accused her grandfather of murdering her family—her brother, her\nfather, her sister. Officially, they all died to separatist assassins. Her\naccusations were swept under the rug, but she never recanted. Those rumors\nthat she doesn’t like her grandfather are wrong. She loathes her\ngrandfather.”\n“Yet she still serves him.”\n“Because she is a patriot. She does not serve him, she serves all of\nDynize. She knows as well as he does that bringing back our god is the best\nchance of reunification.”\nMichel held up one finger, trying to catch up with all of this. “I thought\nthe godstones were used to create new gods, but you’re speaking of\nresurrection.”\n“Of course. We brought his remains with us. Sedial is confident that the\ncombined power of the stones, and of his bone-eyes, will bring our god\nback.”\nSomething about that troubled Michel, but he wasn’t entirely sure what.\n“So what does any of this have to do with me sleeping with Ichtracia?”\n“Because Ichtracia has made a practice for over a decade of taking to\nbed anyone she thinks will annoy Sedial—generals, ministers, bodyguards.\nHalf of his enemies in the capitol have gone through her rooms.”\nMichel frowned. “Should the promiscuity bother me? Because I’m a\nspy. Believe it or not, I’ve seen worse.”\n“Not really,” Yaret said with a shrug. “That is expected of Privileged.\nThey are a force of nature in that way. But Ichtracia uses Sedial’s enemies\nto annoy him and then she discards them. Many of those ex-lovers died\nunder mysterious circumstances. Some even by Ichtracia’s hand.”\nThat was worrisome.\n“Between Ichtracia and her grandfather,” Yaret continued, “sharing the\nformer’s bed is doubly as dangerous as sleeping with any normal\nPrivileged. It’s something I wanted to warn you about personally.”\nMichel shook his head, trying to decide what he would do about\nIchtracia. He’d spent much of last night in a drunken stupor trying to figure\nout why Taniel had left out so much information about “Mara,” and his\nsuspicions had begun to deepen. “I’ll keep that in mind,” he said.\n“Good. I have use for you, Michel, and I expect you to have a long and\nfruitful career in my Household. Don’t disappoint me.”\nMichel wondered how long that would actually be if he confirmed that\nIchtracia was Mara and convinced her to leave with him. His heart hurt\nbriefly at the idea of leaving Yaret and Tenik behind. He liked them, and he\nhad grown into a place within Yaret’s Household that, aside from the danger\nof Sedial, was actually quite fulfilling.

She was immediately aware of the pain,\ncrying out involuntarily. She gasped, choking on her own saliva, trying to\nmake sense of where she was.\nA light flickered into being and drew closer, and she was soon able to\nmake out Little Flerring’s face cast in shadows. Flerring laid a hand on her\nshoulder, pushing her down. “Moving is a really bad idea right now,” she\nsaid.\n“Powder,” Vlora gasped.\nFlerring withdrew, appearing a few minutes later. Vlora felt something\npressed to her lips, and tasted the bitter sulfur of powder, then felt the grit\nbetween her teeth. The powder trance took effect immediately, running\nthrough her blood like fire, snuffing away a thousand pains until they were\na dull throb in the back of her head. She forced herself to lie still and calm\nher breathing, letting the trance do its work.\n“Better?” Flerring asked.\n“Much,” Vlora said. She tried to sit up, but the effort caused a sweat to\nbreak out on her brow without accomplishing anything. “How long have I\nbeen out?”\n“It’s a bit past one in the morning now. So maybe sixteen hours or so?”\n“What’s the damage?”\nFlerring held a lead ball in front of Vlora’s face. “That’s the bullet I took\nout of your back. Embedded in the muscles back there. It didn’t hit anything\nimportant, but I can’t imagine you’re going to have full use of your upper\nbody for some time. I’m not a great surgeon, but I think I got all the pieces\nof your shirt and jacket out. Hopefully that’ll help avoid an infection.”\n“You think?”\n“I’m paid to blow stuff up, not perform impromptu surgery on powder\nmages. What the pit happened down there? I heard something yesterday\nabout a duel, and then I woke up to see the whole damned city on fire.”\nVlora tried to think. The powder trance was great at deadening the pain,\nbut she’d experienced enough blood loss to leave her brain in a confused\nfog regardless of the powder. “I dueled Jezzy’s champion—that powder\nmage I’ve been fighting with—and killed him. Jezzy accused me of\ncheating and then one of her boys shot me in the back. Once that gun fired,\nall pit broke loose. Jezzy and Burt’s people all started shooting.”\n“I heard Jezzy’s dead,” Flerring said. “They’re saying you killed her.\nBlew up the powder of the men standing beside her.”\nVlora tried to feel bad about it—but it was Jezzy’s man who shot her in\nthe back. Likely on her orders. “She had it coming.”\n“I won’t argue that. Her lieutenants are still fighting, though. There’s\narmed gangs battlin’ all across the city, while the poor bastard miners and\nbusinessmen are trying to put the fires out. Last I heard we lost most of\nMain Street and half the Gurlish quarter, and the fires are still going.”"

Last I heard we lost most of\nMain Street and half the Gurlish quarter, and the fires are still going.”\nVlora took a deep breath and held it, listening. They were a couple miles\noutside the city, but if she focused, she could still hear the occasional\nmusket shot echoing across the valley. “Sounds like the whole city is\ntearing itself apart.”\n“I’ve got a pretty good view from above the cabin, and it looks like the\nwhole city is tearing itself apart.” Flerring got up, and Vlora heard the\npouring of a cup of tea. “Here, drink this. It’ll knock you back out.”\n“I can’t,” Vlora protested. “I’ve got to get moving. I need to contact my\nmen. I need to find Taniel.”\nFlerring put her elbow on Vlora’s shoulder, keeping her down, then\nforced her mouth open with one hand. “Drink,” she ordered.\nThe tea tasted like horseshit and seemed to get everywhere but in\nVlora’s mouth. Flerring mopped up the spills and sat back while Vlora\ncoughed, laughing. “I’ve got that promissory note, but I’d much rather take\nyou back to Adro in one piece, sister. Is Taniel still rotting at the jail?”\n“Yeah.”\n“I’ll send one of my boys down. The deputies are gonna be working\nfrantically to put out this wildfire you started. Shouldn’t be too hard to slip\nhim out.”\nVlora almost protested that they needed him out legitimately, then\ndiscarded the thought with a sigh. What was the point? All their efforts at\nfinding the godstone in secret had gone out the window. It was time for\nbrute force. “Also, need you to send word to Olem. His scouts will have\nreported the fighting. He needs to know about Prime Lektor. If he brings the\nentire brigade in before we find Prime, it’ll get everyone killed.”\n“I’ll send a few of my boys looking,” Flerring promised. “Until then,\nyou need to rest.”\n“I don’t have time to rest.”\nFlerring grinned down at her. “You’re not gonna have a choice. Not with\nthat tea and all the blood you lost. You’ll be out within minutes.” Without\nanother word, Flerring blew her lantern out and shuffled off into the\ndarkness.\nVlora lay still in frustration, staring at the ceiling, wishing she could\nmove. She might be wounded, but she could still think. She had to\nformulate a plan to find Prime and figure out what she was going to do if\nthey couldn’t destroy the stone with Flerring’s blasting oil.\nShe was halfway through the second thought when she again lost\nconsciousness.\nWhen Vlora came to, it was once again light outside. The cabin was quiet\nand cold, and she guessed that it was still early in the morning. Outside, she\ncould hear Little Flerring shouting instructions at her workers and\nwondered if Flerring was beginning to shut down her operation. It would\nmake sense, of course.

She\ncould feel something soft beneath her fingers, and realized that Flerring had\nleft her a powder charge. Saying a silent word of thanks, she managed to\nbring it to her mouth, breaking it open and sprinkling the powder on her\ntongue. Granules bounced off her lips and rolled down her cheeks, and she\ngave a sigh of appreciation as the trance kicked in.\nGradually, the hairs on Vlora’s neck began to stand on end as she came\nto the slow realization that there was someone else in the room. “Who’s\nthere?” she asked, listening to the soft sound of breathing.\nThere was a creak as someone got up from a chair, then heavy footsteps.\nVlora grimaced through the pain and forced herself to roll onto her side,\nexpecting to find one of Flerring’s workers keeping watch.\nShe froze at the sight of the man standing beside the bed. He was of\nmedium height and heavy-set, with an aged, distinguished face marked by a\npurple birthmark that spidered across his bald head. He wore Privileged\ngloves on both hands, the runes gold and crimson, and frowned down at\nVlora like a father might at a disruptive child.\nIt took all of Vlora’s strength not to call out. Prime could kill everyone\nhere before they had the chance to aid her. No sense in all of them dying.\n“Prime,” she croaked, her throat dry.\n“Little Vlora,” Prime said. He dragged the chair across the room and sat\ndown beside the bed, folding his hands in his lap. “I understand that you’re\nLady Flint now, is that true?”\n“Yes.”\n“Seems like just yesterday you were a street tramp, taken in by Tamas.”\nPrime snorted. “I’ve been following your exploits in the papers. First the\nKez Civil War, then the Fatrastan frontier, then Landfall. Now I find you at\nthe ass end of nowhere with a bounty on your head as if you’re a common\noutlaw and not a war hero with your own mercenary army.”\nVlora stared at the side of Prime’s face, trying to read him. His\nexpression was neutral, his face grandfatherly, and she grabbed on to the\nsudden hope that perhaps he wasn’t here to kill her.\n“When’s the last time we saw each other?” Prime asked. “The Adran-\nKez War?”\n“Right before you ran,” Vlora said coldly. She silently rebuked herself.\nShe wasn’t going to fight her way out of this—her only chance was to talk.\nUnfortunately, she was not good at talking.\n“Ah, yes,” Prime said, seemingly unbothered by the accusation of\ncowardice. “You have to understand, I’m not a violent man. I’ve never been\ngood at war. And Kresimir was there! Pit, Kresimir scared me. You have no\nidea just how …” He trailed off, chuckling to himself as if he were relating\na happy memory. “And then the god of the Nine was killed by mortals.

I moved on to other work.”\nVlora was struck by a sudden memory of Prime Lektor visiting Tamas’s\nhouse. She still had been an early teen at the time. Borbador hadn’t yet been\nsnatched up by the royal cabal. She and Taniel were not yet lovers. They\nwere all just happy stepsiblings. Prime had visited for a private\nconversation with Tamas, giving each of the children sweets out of his\npocket. She only now realized that he and Tamas were probably discussing\nthe coup that they would perform against their king five or six years later.\nDespite his grandfatherly look, despite his past loyalties and his current\nclaim of pacifism, it was important to remember who—and what—Prime\nwas. He had spoken with the gods and witnessed the creation of the Nine.\nHe could snuff her out in an instant.\n“So what are you doing here?” she asked.\nPrime tsked quietly. “I was just about to ask you the same thing. This is\nan out-of-the-way place. You’ve been gallivanting around the city for weeks\npretending to be a common hired sword. But your army is camped outside\nthe city while you”—he pointed one finger at her, his hand trembling\n—“you have been looking for something.”\nVlora tried to think of an excuse—any plausible reason for her presence\nhere—but came up with nothing.\nPrime continued before she could respond. “You’re looking for the\ngodstone. It’s unfortunate, little Vlora. You lost one godstone to the Dynize\non the plains south of Landfall. I will not allow you a chance at the second\ngodstone. I will not allow anyone that chance.”\n“I …” Vlora blinked at Prime, trying to figure out what was going on\ninside his head. “I don’t want anyone to have that chance, either.”\n“An interesting sentiment. I don’t know who you’re working for right\nnow. It could be Lindet. It could be the Adran Cabal. Maybe you’re\nworking for yourself. But I will allow none of you to have the godstone. It\nis too dangerous to fall into the hands of mortals.”\n“And you think the Predeii are any more trustworthy?” Vlora spat before\nshe could stop herself.\nPrime seemed surprised by this. “What? Oh, absolutely not. If I knew\nwhere the others were—if any of them are alive—I would keep it away\nfrom them as well.”\n“I think,” Vlora said, trying to focus her thoughts, “that we need to come\nto an understanding.” If Prime was telling the truth, and he was indeed here\nto keep anyone else from finding the godstone, then they were fighting for\nthe same thing. Prime could be a valuable ally if he could be convinced.\nShe considered the ramifications and decided to tell him the truth. “Prime, I\ndon’t want the godstone used any more than you do. I fought for Landfall to\nkeep the godstone out of the hands of the Dynize. I have a bounty on my\nhead because I tried to arrest Lindet when I found out she wanted to use the\ngodstone.”"

I have a bounty on my\nhead because I tried to arrest Lindet when I found out she wanted to use the\ngodstone.”\nShe continued in earnest. “I lived through that war. I saw it to the very\nend and I lost so many people I hold dear. I was a prisoner of Brude, and I\nsaw Kresimir. Do you think I want more gods in this world? I’m here to\ndestroy the damned thing!”\nPrime sat back in the chair, looking troubled. He examined Vlora, tilting\nhis head first to one side and then the other. “I’ve always been too trusting.\nI’ve always put my faith in people. That’s why I spent so many centuries\nadministrating a university in Adopest.” His expression hardened. “But\npeople have betrayed that trust too many times. I see the Dynize. I see\nLindet. I see the ambitions of the cabals and the governments. All\nknowledge of the godstone must be erased.”\n“It’s too late for that,” Vlora said, reaching out to him. “The Dynize\nknow. That’s why they’re here. Everyone knows. Everyone who matters.\nYou can’t hide it forever. Let me help you destroy it.”\n“I’m sorry,” Prime said sadly. “I can’t trust you. I wish I could, but …\nI’ll make it quick.” He raised his gloved hands.\n“Wait!” Vlora pleaded.\nThere was a flash of movement out of the corner of her eye, and Vlora\nshied away, waiting for sorcery to burn the flesh from her bones. When she\nopened her eyes, she saw Prime sitting upright in his chair, a surprised\nexpression on his face. Taniel stood behind him, a sword to Prime’s neck.\nHe held the sword like a garrote, with one hand on the pommel and one on\nthe bare blade.\nThe blood pounded in Vlora’s ears as she waited, helplessly wounded,\nfor one of the two men to act.\nPrime lifted his gloved hands. “Do you know what I am?”\n“I know exactly what you are,” Taniel whispered. “Do you know what I\nam?”\nPrime frowned. “Is that Taniel Two-shot?”\n“You’ve got an excellent memory.”\n“You died with Brude and Kresimir.”\n“My death was greatly exaggerated. Yours won’t be if you don’t pluck\nthose gloves very carefully off your hands. I imagine you’re very hard to\nkill, but I can decapitate you with a twitch and I will make sure all the\npieces are scattered very widely.”\nPrime licked his lips, looking at Vlora ruefully. “Why don’t you just kill\nme, then?”\n“Because,” Vlora told him, “I wasn’t lying. We’re here to destroy the\ngodstone. We tried to destroy the one in Landfall but were unable to. If we\nall pool our knowledge together, we might actually be able to accomplish\nour mutual goal.”\n“You have five seconds to start taking off those gloves,” Taniel warned.\n“Four … three … two—”\n“Wait,” Vlora said. “I need him to heal me.”\n“You what?” both men asked at the same time.\n“I need you to heal me,” she said to Prime. “I can’t help in my state.

You at least\nneed to take care of those so I can function.”\n“You would trust him to poke around inside your body? He was ready to\nkill you,” Taniel said, his disbelief plain.\n“If he’s going to trust us, we have to trust him.”\n“I, uh, am not a very good healer,” Prime said. “I’ve picked it up over\nthe years, but I’m slow and not as thorough as a healer who has more power\nin the appropriate disciplines.”\n“Make do,” Vlora said. She met Taniel’s eyes. “Let him work.”\nTaniel relaxed, but he did not move. “All right, Prime. Get to work. We\ndon’t have much time, so focus on her back—and do a good job, hmm?”\nCHAPTER 54\nV\nlora emerged from Flerring’s cabin into the daylight, blinking to allow\nher eyes to adjust and reaching to scratch at the tightness that seemed to\nstretch across both shoulders and down her spine. Prime Lektor emerged\nbehind her and, following close on Prime’s heels, Taniel.\nVlora had been healed by Privileged on several occasions. The very best\nof them could make the experience only vaguely unpleasant—not unlike\ngetting stitches from a skilled surgeon—and leave the body feeling a little\nstiff but good as new. Prime was true to his word in that he was not very\ngood.\nThe process had taken him several hours. The bullet wound in her back\nwas healed, true, but it felt as tight as a knot from riding a thousand miles in\na badly sized saddle. The skin was taut and uncomfortable, and she would\nprobably have to have it sliced open by a surgeon and rehealed sooner\nrather than later.\nIt was, she decided, still better than bleeding out. Or having to wait for\nmonths while she healed naturally.\n“I warned you I wasn’t very good,” Prime said sullenly.\nVlora side-eyed the Predeii. There was a time when she had genuinely\nfeared him, the way any teenager fears the headmaster of a university. That\nfear had changed when she found out his true nature and then … well, she’d\nnever really come to grips with his abandoning Adro during the Adran-Kez\nWar.\n“It’ll do,” she said, rotating her shoulder and moving her sword arm. She\ncould fight if she needed to, and that’s all that mattered. “Where is the\nstone?” she asked.\n“Nighttime Vale,” Prime said.\nVlora swore. She’d scoured the Vale herself and seen nothing. Either\nPrime was lying or he had it hidden with sorcery. “You sure about that? I\nwould have seen either it or your sorcery in the Else.”\n“I’m sure,” Prime insisted, drawing himself up. His gloveless fingers\ntwitched, and Vlora could feel his urge to reach into the Else. He still didn’t\ntrust them. “I’m not a novice when it comes to hiding sorcery,” he said. “I\nhid in plain sight from the Adran Cabal for five hundred years. I can hide a\nbloody rock from some miners and a powder mage.”"

I’m going to talk to Flerring.”\nVlora found Little Flerring up in her largest workshop, overseeing the\ncareful packing of black powder. The workshop was in chaos, tools strewn\nabout, powder scattered on the floor as men hurried around with sacks and\nbarrels. “What’s going on?” Vlora asked.\nFlerring glanced at her, then did a double take. “You should be in bed.”\n“I’m fine,” Vlora insisted.\n“You’re not fine. You bloody well got shot.” Flerring crossed the room\nand grabbed Vlora by the shoulder, pulling down the collar of her shirt to\nlook at the wound. Her eyes narrowed. “There’s sorcery here.”\nVlora had no interest in explaining Prime Lektor’s role. “Taniel arrived\nwith an old friend. I’ll be fine.”\n“Don’t spill that, you twat!” Flerring roared at one of her men. “You’re\noverfilling the barrels!” She turned back to Vlora. “We’re packing up. The\ntown is half-torched, and everyone is out for blood. I’m going to sell off\nwhat stock I can and get out of here before the Dynize come too far north.\nFatrasta is too hot for my blood.”\n“The temperature or the conflict?”\n“Both.”\n“Right.” Vlora took Flerring by the arm, pulling her close. “That\nblasting oil. I need it.”\n“I don’t—”\n“I need it today,” Vlora hissed. “We have a man who knows where the\nartifact is. I want it destroyed as quickly as possible. You’ve had your\nweek.”\nFlerring looked toward her men packing her supplies and made a sour\nface. “I don’t want to stick around any longer than we have to.”\n“Send your men ahead. You made a promise.”\nShe could see the conflict in Flerring’s expression. Flerring scowled,\nturning her head with a quick intake of breath, before finally speaking. “All\nright. I’ll keep a few of my boys and all the blasting oil I’ve scrounged\nbehind and send everyone else on. The location better be ready for blasting,\nbecause I don’t intend on staying any more than a couple of days.”\n“Take all your supplies to the Nighttime Vale. I’ll be waiting.”\nVlora rejoined Taniel and Prime Lektor, and the three of them rode back\ninto town, doing a long circuit around the base of the mountains to avoid\nthe armed men prowling the streets and the bucket brigades still trying to\nput out fires.\n“Who won?” Vlora asked Taniel as they crossed the entrance to a\nnarrow valley. Nearby, a couple of drunk miners watched the town, passing\na jug of grog between them and alternately weeping and giggling at some\nlost fortune.\nTaniel looked up, deep in thought as he rubbed the cloth of Prime’s\nconfiscated gloves between two fingers. “Brown Bear Burt,” he said,\nnodding toward the center of Yellow Creek. “I understand you killed Jezzy\nwith a controlled explosion.

Not much to do for Burt but to mop up Jezzy’s\nforces and put out the fires.”\n“I hope there’s a damned lot of fires,” Vlora murmured to herself. She\nwanted Burt distracted until they were well and gone. He’d promised not to\nget in her way, but the promise of a miner baron didn’t reassure her.\n“There were,” Taniel answered, as if she had spoken to him directly.\n“But he also has a lot of men.” A half smile crossed Taniel’s face and he\nseemed to withdraw into his own thoughts again. Vlora leaned over and\nsmacked him on the arm.\n“What do you mean he has a lot of men? I thought Jezzy outnumbered\nhim?”\nTaniel blinked back at her. “Oh, yeah. That’s what everyone thought.\nThey also thought he was from Landfall.”\n“He’s not?”\n“He’s not,” Taniel confirmed.\nVlora’s mind scrambled, trying to figure out what could be keeping\nTaniel distracted like this. Her thoughts went to the conversation they’d had\nriding into Yellow Creek three weeks ago. “Palo Nation?” she asked.\nTaniel nodded. “I didn’t know until I caught a glimpse of him on my\nway to find you. He’s Palo Nation, and so is the army he’s had camped up\nin the mountains until he brought them down to restore order last night.”\nVlora felt her stomach lurch. “How big of any army?”\n“About two thousand riflemen. The Palo Nation doesn’t field real\narmies. They field highly organized groups of skirmishers armed with rifles\nthat rival the Hrusch.”\nThis was getting better and better. The Palo Nation had just taken\ncontrol of Yellow Creek, leaving Vlora once more in enemy territory—and\nshe did assume they were the enemy. Everyone was the enemy right now,\nbecause everyone wanted to get hold of the godstone. So much for Burt’s\npromise. What else was he hiding? “We can’t let them know about the\nstone,” she said. She looked at Prime. “Your wards to keep the stone\nhidden, are they still in place?”\n“No reason they shouldn’t be,” Prime answered.\n“Are they looking for the stone?” Vlora asked Taniel.\nHe seemed to withdraw into himself once again, his face troubled. “I\ndon’t know. I don’t think so.”\n“Then why are they in Yellow Creek? If they had the firepower, why\nhaven’t they seized control of the town before today?”\n“It’s not like them to act out in the open south of the Ironhook\nMountains. I don’t know what they’re up to.”\n“I think I liked it better when you seemed to know everything,” Vlora\nsnapped, feeling her tension get the better of her. “Hurry up, old man,” she\ntold Prime. “We need to get a move on. I damn well hope no one stops\nLittle Flerring on her way up here.”\nThey continued on their circuit around the town and entered Nighttime\nVale. A handful of Palo wearing dusters and holding rifles had replaced\nJezzy’s guards, but they were the only other people in the Vale and did not\nseem to notice the small party passing by."

A handful of Palo wearing dusters and holding rifles had replaced\nJezzy’s guards, but they were the only other people in the Vale and did not\nseem to notice the small party passing by.\n“I’ve cloaked us in sorcery,” Prime explained. “I always do when I come\nthis way. It’s best to keep the artifact hidden.”\nVlora couldn’t sense even the slightest hint of sorcery. The thought\nmade her sick to her stomach.\nPrime turned sharply after they passed the entrance to the Vale and led\nthem up the side of the mountain, not more than fifty paces from where\nVlora had crossed over the cliffs a few nights before. There was no\nconstruction here, none of the mining equipment or tents that were\nubiquitous throughout the rest of the valley. There was just the foot of the\nmountain covered by a landslide of stone rubble from somewhere farther up\nthe mountainside.\nPrime stopped and pointed at the mountain. “It’s difficult to see, but if\nyou look carefully, you can trace the path of the landslide that deposited\nthese stones here.”\nVlora squinted up into the sparse cloud cover, barely able to see the peak\nthrough tufts of wispy white. If she squinted just right, she could imagine\nthat the mountain’s peak had once been more squared than pointed, and that\none corner of that square had sheared off and tumbled all this way to rest in\nthe Vale.\n“The godstone,” Taniel said, voicing the same conclusion that Vlora had\njust reached. “It was up there?”\n“It was, yes,” Prime answered. He looked at them sullenly, scowling at\nthe gloves that Taniel still held in his hands. “You claim that you’re here to\ndestroy it. But it can’t be destroyed. I’ve spent the last five years trying to\nfigure out how to do so and came up with nothing.”\n“Have you actually tried to destroy it?” Vlora asked. “Or have you been\nstudying it to further your own power?”\n“I must study it to learn its weaknesses.” Prime sniffed. “I have never\nbeen after power, my dear Vlora. I only seek knowledge.”\nVlora looked at Taniel. “You remember what Bo likes to say about\nthat?”\n“Knowledge is power,” Taniel quoted, giving Prime a sallow smile.\nWithout his gloves, Prime looked like nothing more than an overweight,\ncranky old man. He scowled at them both, then shook his head. “You\ncannot destroy it,” he repeated. “I don’t believe it can be done.”\nVlora thought about all the black powder they had piled around the\ngodstone in Landfall, only for it to cause not even a scratch. “We’ll see.\nTake us to the damned thing.”\nPrime scoffed. “You think you’re so smart, but you can’t even see that\nwhich is in front of you. Dismount and take three steps forward.”\nVlora did as instructed, feeling outward with her sorcerous senses for an\nillusion, or a trap, or anything. She could sense nothing, but as she took that\nthird step, her vision seemed to shift. It happened so suddenly that it made\nher dizzy, forcing her to fall against a nearby boulder.\n“Vlora?” Taniel called."

        "text": "third step, her vision seemed to shift. It happened so suddenly that it made\nher dizzy, forcing her to fall against a nearby boulder.\n“Vlora?” Taniel called.\nShe waved him off and felt her eyes widen as she took in this new\nperspective.\nThe slope of old rubble was no longer there, but rather cleared away\nfrom her to the base of the mountain to create a flat work area upon which\nthere was a small cabin, an outhouse, and a canvas canopy covering an\nobelisk that looked exactly like the one in Landfall.\nHer breath caught in her throat, and the sight of the thing gave her a\nsense of foreboding that she hadn’t felt since the end of the Adran-Kez War.\nHer chest was tight, her vision blurry. This stone—this thing—that had\neluded her for the last month was suddenly here, right in front of her face,\nand she was speechless.\nThe obelisk lay on its side. It was not as large as the one in Landfall.\nEyeing the dimensions, she guessed it to be around thirty feet long and less\nthan four feet wide, tapering at the end. It was covered in ancient script that\nhad been cleaned meticulously of all dirt and grit, and it was made of a\nlight-gray limestone that made Vlora wonder if it was cut from the same\nstone as its larger twin back in Landfall.\nTaniel and Prime joined them. Taniel did not seem as affected by the\nsight of the thing as she had been, though his breath did grow short. Prime\nmerely scowled at it, like a man returning to a hated live-in relative.\n“So they found you, eh?”\nThe voice made both Vlora and Taniel whirl, drawing their pistols. A\nwoman had stepped out of the cabin and stood by the doorway, her arms\ncrossed. She looked to be in her late thirties: a slim woman of medium\nheight with a shaved head and an old scar that lifted the corner of her lip\nand crossed her cheek to her temple. Her arms ended in strange gloves that,\nupon closer examination, were unmoving bronze hands held in place by\nleather straps.\nVlora had never met this woman, but she knew exactly who she was\nfrom Borbador’s stories.\nShe was another Predeii, personally responsible for the summoning of\nKresimir during the Adran-Kez War. If Bo was correct, she was as much a\ncatalyst of the war as Field Marshal Tamas. Vlora was not happy to see her.\n“Hello, Julene,” Taniel said, lowering his pistol.\n“Two-shot,” Julene purred. “It feels like we were hanging from\nKresimir’s ropes together just yesterday. How have you been?”\nTaniel seemed neither perturbed nor particularly surprised to find Julene\nhere. Vlora was both, and she kept her pistol raised for several seconds after\nTaniel had put away his. “That was ten years ago,” Taniel said.\n“When you’ve been alive as long as I have, Two-shot, a decade feels\nlike nothing more than a long weekend.” Julene’s gaze fell to Vlora and she\npursed her lips. “I told Prime he should have killed you the moment he\nspotted you in town. But he’s a damned coward. What do you call yourself,"

A pacifist?”\n“I went to finish her off,” Prime snapped, “but this one showed up.”\nJulene took two steps toward Taniel, her nostrils flaring and her eyes\nnarrowing. “Your blood witch is getting stronger,” she said. “I can barely\nsee the wards protecting you.” She let out a sudden, half-mad, barking\nlaugh. “Bad luck for you, Prime. You finally get up the guts to kill someone\nand the one powder mage in the world who can stop you happens to be\nabout.”\nVlora looked from Prime to Julene. “Some warning that you weren’t\nalone would have been nice,” she told Prime.\n“You didn’t ask,” he responded.\nJulene held up her metal hands. “I may be near immortal, but I’m not\nmuch of a threat. I still can’t touch the Else.”\n“That only makes you slightly less dangerous,” Taniel said. His casual\nmanner was betrayed by the tension Vlora could see in his arms and the\nintensity of his gaze, like a dog with hackles raised. Vlora took a half step\nback. If this came to a fight, she was so badly outclassed that it was almost\nlaughable. Taniel would be on his own against these two.\n“We’re here to destroy the godstone,” Vlora interjected.\nAll eyes snapped to her. Julene turned her head to one side. “You what?”\n“You heard me.”\n“I heard you. I just don’t believe you. If you cornered Prime, you\nobviously know what the godstones do, and if you know, then you have no\nintention of destroying them. Mortals don’t give up that kind of power.”\nThe wild look in Julene’s eyes was suddenly gone, replaced by a focused\ngaze and a very distinct air of distrust.\n“She’s not lying,” Taniel said quietly. “Both Lindet and the Dynize are\nlooking for the damned thing. We intend on reducing it to rubble before\neither of them can reach it.”\n“You can’t destroy it,” Prime insisted once again. “It’s too powerful.\nKresimir made these things to last until long after all life on this planet is\nextinct. I can’t even pick apart the simplest of the wards surrounding it, and\nI’ve been doing this for millennia!” Prime’s voice rose in crescendo, and\nVlora wondered if he truly had been trying to destroy the stone. He sounded\nfrustrated as pit that even his powerful sorcery paled next to that of a god\nwho’d been dead for a decade.\nJulene had grown quiet, returning to her place in the doorway and\nwatching Vlora and Taniel warily. “This is the work of a god,” she said.\n“You would destroy it just to keep it out of the hands of others?”\n“I would destroy it either way,” Vlora said, forcing down her fear and\nfixing Julene with a look that dared her to question her resolve.\nTaniel stepped between them, waving his hand in front of Julene’s face.\n“Everyone should calm down.

It didn’t do anything but\ncause a second landslide that we had to clear away.”\n“And we tried it on the godstone in Landfall,” Taniel said.\n“So why,” Julene said with more than a hint of disdain, “do you think\nyou can blow it up?”\nVlora remained silent, suddenly feeling overwhelmed and fearful. “We\nhave to try,” she finally said. “If we cannot destroy it, then we’ll haul the\nthing to the coast, put it on a ship, and sink it to the bottom of the sea.”\n“And you expect to be able to do that with Dynize and Fatrastan armies\ncrawling all over the countryside?” Prime demanded.\n“With your help we could.”\nJulene scoffed again. “Don’t look at us. I’m useless without my hands,\nand this coward might as well be. He’d rather pick up and run than raise his\nhands to cause bloodshed.”\nPrime’s lip curled, but he did not dispute the claim.\nVlora looked to Taniel for reassurance, but he seemed just as uncertain\nas she felt. His brow furrowed, he walked to the godstone and ran his\ngloved fingers along the runes, shuddering visibly. “I should have brought\nKa-poel,” she heard him mutter. Louder, he said, “Like Vlora said, we have\nto try.”\n“It’ll be a waste of gunpowder,” Julene stated.\n“We’re not using powder,” Vlora responded, heading over to a rock and\nsitting down where she could watch the entrance to the valley. She ignored\nthe others, taking the time to close her eyes and meditate.\nIt was almost three hours until a convoy of wagons finally appeared,\nwith Flerring sitting in the foremost one. She said something to Burt’s\nguards, money changed hands, and she continued on through the pass.\nVlora went down to meet her and show her the way to the hidden godstone.\n“Get working right away. We’ve got one shot at this, and then, if it\ndoesn’t work, we’ll have to figure out another plan.”\nFlerring leaned down from the lip of the wagon. “I’ll get to work,” she\nsaid, “but you might want to head into Yellow Creek.”\n“Why?”\n“Because four hundred Riflejacks just showed up outside the town and"

She then considered what\nOlem would do if he assumed her dead at the hands of a bunch of frontier\nruffians. “Get started on the stone,” she shouted into her shoulder, sprinting\nfor her horse. “I’ve got to stop a slaughter.”\nCHAPTER 55\nV\nlora spotted her soldiers from the entrance to Nighttime Vale. They’d\ntaken up a position just on the edge of town, where they’d formed into two\nimposing ranks. Rifles were still shouldered, which was a good sign, but\nshe knew better than anyone how quickly the Riflejacks could open fire\nfrom a ready position.\nShe wasn’t able to see what they were up against until she was almost\nupon them. Galloping down the main avenue, she steered her horse through\ntoppled carts across bloody cobbles—the aftermath of the fighting between\nJezzy’s and Burt’s gangs—and arrived to find about three hundred hired\nguns and prospectors strung out across rooftops, shop fronts, and barricaded\nroads. There were about thirty yards between the Riflejacks and the city’s\nwould-be defenders. The Riflejacks had the numbers and the training, but\nthe defenders held the high defensive positions. If this went south, it would\ngo very poorly for both sides.\nVlora leapt from the saddle and crossed a short barricade to where Burt\nand Olem stood facing each other in the open space between the two forces.\n“Wait!”\nOlem looked up with a surprised expression that passed quickly to relief\nand then stoicism. Burt let out a heavy sigh and gestured to Vlora as she\narrived.\n“See?” Burt said. “I told you she was fine the last time I saw her.”\nVlora remembered lying in the dirt, facedown, after her duel with\nNohan. “Fine” seemed like a stretch, but she let it pass. “Stand down,” she\nordered. “Both of you.”\nOlem regarded Burt with a long, thoughtful look, then swept his gaze\nacross the assembled defenders. “We’ll stand down when they stand down.”\nVlora swore under her breath and turned to Burt. “This doesn’t have to\nescalate.”\n“I’d really rather it not,” Burt replied coolly. “The colonel here was just\ninforming me that he would take apart Yellow Creek stick by stick to find\nyou. I told him that was entirely unnecessary. You and I had a deal.”\n“And it still stands, right?” Vlora fixed Burt with a long, hard look.\n“It still stands.” Burt gestured to the city. “Thanks to you, and one of\nJezzy’s men getting trigger-happy, this town belongs to me.” He scowled at\nVlora, taking a step back to examine her shoulder and back. “The last time I\nsaw you, you’d been shot.”\n“Shot?” Olem echoed. “I thought you said she was fine?”\n“Fine-ish.”\n“Long story,” Vlora cut Burt off before he could say anything else. “But"

        "text": "“Shot?” Olem echoed. “I thought you said she was fine?”\n“Fine-ish.”\n“Long story,” Vlora cut Burt off before he could say anything else. “But\neveryone needs to back off before one of your men loses their nerve and\nthis turns into a pitched battle. Olem, order the Riflejacks to fall back. Burt,\nwill a half mile be sufficient to cool everyone’s temper?”\n“It will.” Burt gave a magnanimous smile. “In the meantime, would you\njoin me for a drink? I think the three of us need to talk. Now.”\n“You don’t remember me, do you?”\nVlora took a whiskey from Burt and glanced at Olem, uncertain. They\nsat around Burt’s desk in the office above his brothel. The building was\nempty except for the three of them—everyone else putting out fires, sifting\nthrough the ashes, or fighting over Jezzy’s unguarded claims. Vlora\nwondered why Burt wasn’t out there overseeing the whole thing. “Have we\nmet before?”\nBurt offered Olem a cigarette and took his own seat, letting out a soft\nlaugh. “We have. About twelve years ago.”\n“I only first came to Fatrasta a couple years back,” Vlora said with some\nconfusion.\n“That doesn’t mean I haven’t been to Adro.”\nVlora frowned. Palo were quite rare in the Nine. A decade ago they were\nstill considered mysterious savages by polite society. “When?”\n“Jilleman University,” Burt said.\nVlora leaned forward, squinting at Burt’s face. She searched her\nmemory for a few moments before locking on to something. “I did meet a\nPalo. My first year. I don’t remember his name, but …” She trailed off.\nOccasionally, a wealthy Palo chieftain would send a favored child to the\nNine to get a Kressian education. Sometimes a whole tribe would pool their\nwealth to do the same. Vlora remembered one of the former—a boy, quite\nyoung with an optimistic face who’d paraded around in frontier buckskins\nand spoke Adran with an accent so bad it was laughable. She tried to\nreconcile that boy with the suave frontier capitalist sitting across from her.\nBurt grinned, watching her face. “You do remember!”\n“Your name wasn’t Burt. I would have remembered that.”\n“No.” Burt looked up as if searching his memory. “I don’t even\nremember what I went by. Something unpronounceable.”\n“So you weren’t really a chieftain’s son?” Vlora asked.\n“That, more or less, was true. Most of the details were either foggy or\noutright lies.”\nOlem stood with an unlit cigarette between his fingers. “Why the\ndeception?”\n“We’ll get to that,” Burt said, lighting a cigar before tossing Olem a box\nof matches. “First, you should know that both Lindet and the Dynize know\nthat you’re here, and why you’ve come. Lindet’s Second Field Army was\nwiped out in three successive battles a couple weeks back, so she’s in no\nposition to send anyone after you. The Dynize, however, have five brigades\non your tail. I’m guessing they’ll be here in four days.”"

Olem scoffed. “You couldn’t\npossibly know all that.”\n“I do,” Burt said without a trace of smugness. “Lindet thinks she runs\nthe messenger service along the mountains—and she does pay for most of\nit. But it’s staffed by my people. The information carried along it reaches\nme before it reaches her. You,” he said, pointing to Vlora, “were outed by\nher spies about the same time the Dynize destroyed the Second Army.”\n“You could have warned me.”\n“It wasn’t convenient at the time,” Burt said with an apologetic smile.\n“But it is now, and you’re being warned.”\nVlora tried to read Burt’s face, attempting to come away with any real\nimpression of the man. He was a blank slate, returning her gaze with a\ncoolness that bordered on unsettling. “So you know why we’re here?”\n“I assume I do. You’re looking for the godstone.”\nVlora shared a glance with Olem before nodding slowly. “You’re not a\nfrontier capitalist, are you?”\n“Oh, I’m very much a frontier capitalist,” Burt responded, looking\nsomewhat hurt. “I’ve gotten to be filthy rich working this town.” He gave\nVlora a lopsided smile. “But you’re right, I’m not just a prospector.”\nVlora remembered her conversations with Taniel, and his search for a\ncontact with the Palo Nation. “You’re with the Palo Nation.”\n“I’m impressed you’ve heard of it.”\n“A friend warned me.”\nBurt snorted. “You mean Taniel Two-shot?” He scratched his head\nvigorously, squinting at Vlora through one eye until he was done. “I’ll be\nhonest, I don’t really know what to do with him. Letting him sit in that\nprison for the last three weeks was the best decision I’ve made in years. I do\nnot like someone like him running around unchecked.”\n“How did you know he’d stay?”\n“Because he’s a good man. We’ve met on several occasions, actually.\nWhich was another reason I didn’t want him to see me before I was ready.”\n“Are there any of our secrets you don’t know?” Olem asked.\n“I …” Burt pulled a wry face and leaned forward, spreading his arms\nacross his desk. “A quick history lesson, my friends, and listen carefully\nbecause only a handful of Kressians have ever heard it: Fifty years ago, my\ngrandfather ruled a midsized tribe in what you would call the Fatrastan\nWilds. At the time, he had managed to unite dozens of tribes into a sort of\nloose coalition, not one of which had ever made contact with a Kressian.\nUntil, that is, a young explorer arrived and made friends with my\ngrandfather. The explorer wound up marrying one of his daughters—my\nmother.”\n“You’re not fully Palo?” Vlora asked in surprise.\n“I’m half-Adran,” Burt said with a smile. “But I don’t look it.” He"

        "text": "mother.”\n“You’re not fully Palo?” Vlora asked in surprise.\n“I’m half-Adran,” Burt said with a smile. “But I don’t look it.” He\ncontinued with his story. “My father was something of a Fatrastaphile—he\nloved everything about this continent, and colonial expansion was one of\nthe few things that I’ve ever seen him get worked up about. Together with\nmy grandparents, my aunts and uncles, and my mother, he began to make a\nplan for the future of his tribe, to protect them from the Kressian\nencroachment.\n“Geography was our ally. Without inside knowledge, the Ironhook\nMountains are very difficult to cross, and the wilds beyond them are vast.\nFor fifty years, no one has questioned the fact that Kressian explorers rarely\nreturn from their expeditions north. And for fifty years, no one in the Nine\nhas questioned the wealthy, eccentric savages sent to learn at Kressian\nuniversities. You’ve gawked and laughed, but never thought twice. And\nduring that time, we learned.” Burt stopped, cleared his throat. “I’ve gone\non too long, so here is a better summary: Beginning with my grandfather,\nthe Palo Nation has studied you without being studied back. We have co-\nopted the best parts of your civilization. The tribes were united, the\nhereditary chieftain system replaced with democracy. We have become the\nthing that Lindet and all the rest of the colonial powers fear the most:\nnatives who have modernized before we could be crushed underfoot.”\nA long silence hung in the air, and Burt took advantage of it to relight\nhis cigar. He’d finished his tale with a measure of emotion, but it\ndisappeared back into tranquility as he puffed up a storm of cigar smoke.\n“Why are you telling us this?” Vlora asked.\nBurt pointed his cigar at her. “Because I’m laying all my cards on the\ntable. Because the Palo Nation won’t remain hidden forever, and I, if you’ll\nremember, am half Adran. I quite like Adro. It is the only democracy in the\nNine, and I would like very much to lay the groundwork of an alliance.”\nVlora felt like she’d been punched in the face. This was not what she’d\nexpected when she came here looking for the godstones, not even in the\nslightest. Taniel’s warnings about the Palo Nation were, in retrospect, not\nemphatic enough. “I think that our politicians would be amenable to the\nidea. But I’m not one of them.”\n“You’re a damned war hero, an Adran general, and a member of the\nRepublic Cabal. I can think of perhaps five people who would be more\nadvantageous to have this conversation with. None of them are here, and\nnone of them quite have your reputation for civility.”\n“I see. Consider me intrigued. But there are plenty of things to worry\nabout before a formal alliance. Where do the godstones come into this? Or\nthe Dynize, for that matter.”\n“The Dynize,” Burt repeated, pulling a sour face. “They’re one of the\nreasons we’re having this conversation. If they win this war, they won’t be\nsatisfied with tall tales from over the mountains. They will explore north, in"

They will explore north, in\nforce, and they will do so with far more violence and organization than\nLindet can manage. For all her intelligence, she’s been holding together a\nhouse of cards by sheer willpower and has had no interest in pursuing\nrumors of our existence. I’m not convinced the Dynize will feel the same\nway.”\n“And the godstone?”\nBurt frowned at Olem, then at Vlora. “We are a secular society. We have\ndestroyed our idols, forgotten our gods, and we are better for it. My spies\ntell me that you and Lindet fell out because you wanted to destroy the stone,\nso I say this: By all means, destroy it. My government wants nothing to do\nwith the damned thing. If we could have found it, we would have already\nremoved it to the farthest reaches of our territory just to keep it out of\nLindet’s hands.” Something must have shown in Vlora’s face, because Burt\nlifted an eyebrow. “You’ve found it, haven’t you?”\n“And we’re working toward destroying it,” Vlora replied.\n“Excellent.” Burt stood up, clapping his hands together. “Can you do it\nbefore the Dynize arrive?”\n“We hope so,” Vlora said hesitantly.\n“You have four days.”\n“Actually, we only have two. We have to destroy it, then get out of here\nbefore the Dynize arrive. The Dynize have instructions to take my head.”\n“Why?” Burt asked with disgust.\n“Because I humiliated their general, or whatever he wants to call\nhimself, back at Landfall.”\n“Ah,” Burt said. “Nothing like a despot who takes things personally. The\nDynize and Kressians aren’t all that different, are they?”\n“We all want to be the last ones standing,” Olem commented.\n“Now, that’s just everyone.” Burt raised his glass of whiskey. “You will\nhave what help I can give you. The town is yours to billet your men, but as\nyou suggest, you shouldn’t tarry. Destroy the godstone or make preparations\nto move it immediately.”\nVlora considered the offer for a moment, waiting for the other shoe to\ndrop. Where was the price, or the betrayal? Was Burt seriously doing all this\njust to make a friend in the Nine? “You do realize that putting us up, even\nfor a night or two, will earn the anger of the Dynize? If we leave, the town\nwill be undefended.”\n“I know,” Burt said with a sigh. “I’ve spent the last few years trying to\ntake this town over by wile, to turn it into a beachhead for my country\nwithout Lindet finding out. Everything changed when the Dynize invaded,\nthough. If they head our way, we will eject the prospectors and dynamite\nthe passes. They might take the town, but my people will be safe up in the\nhigh places.”\n“Even if they have Privileged?”\n“We are not … undefended when it comes to sorcery.”\nVlora wondered what Taniel would say when she told him about this\nconversation.

And I hope\nthis is the start of a long friendship.”\nCHAPTER 56\nM\nichel sat on a stool, the only piece of furniture in a looted, upscale\ntenement apartment on the northwest edge of the Landfall Plateau. His eyes\nwere closed, his mind wandering, as he considered the options available to\nhim from this point out.\nThe apartment was, as far as Michel could tell, the nicest of Taniel’s safe\nhouses. It had tall ceilings and enormous, south-facing windows in the great\nroom, and even a master bedroom with a balcony that looked off the\nplateau. At some point over the last couple of months it had been\nthoroughly tossed—a safe in the corner of the master bedroom had been\nripped out of the wall, the furniture and silver stolen, and even the gas lines\nturned off and ripped out of the wall. It was the first time Michel had been\nto this particular safe house and he was more than a little disappointed to\nfind it in this state.\nBut it did give him a place to think.\nHis whole mission with the Dynize was to snatch Mara—Ichtracia—and\nget her the pit out of Dynize territory. The fact that she was a Privileged\nmade this more like trying to extract a rabid bear rather than an informant.\nEven if she was a normal person, all his old Blackhat routes were\ncompromised. He needed a new escape route.\nAnd he found himself less eager to use it than he had expected. The\nDynize government was a viper’s nest, with Sedial as the king viper ready\nto kill anything that moved. But part of Michel desperately wanted to finish\nwhat he’d started. Hunting down Blackhats had brought out a mean streak\nin him, a deep satisfaction at rounding up the people whom he’d helped to\noppress Landfall for so long. Watching the way the Dynize treated the\noccupied city, and especially the Palo, had deepened Michel’s hatred of\nLindet’s regime. Je Tura’s indiscriminate bombings, his killing of women\nand children—these gave Michel a real urge to finally put him in the\nground.\nHe bounced a coin on his knee, thinking about Tenik, and wondering if\nTenik and Yaret would ever forgive him for disappearing right on the eve of\nfinally clearing Landfall of the Blackhats.\n“Guess we’ll have to find out.” Michel got to his feet, carrying the stool\nover to the corner of the great room. He set it against the wall, using it as a\nstepping point to lift himself onto the gaudy trim that went around the\nmiddle of the wall. He braced one leg on a hole in the plaster where\nsomeone had torn out a gas lantern, then kicked another hole in the plaster\nto get him up near the ceiling. He produced a knife, and began to stab\nthrough the ceiling until he hit something solid.\nHis legs trembled from the effort of bracing himself, and the half-healed\ngunshot wound in his chest began to burn.

He quickly cut through the\nceiling plaster and then used the handle of the knife to bash the rest of it\nuntil the ceiling finally gave way, a large metal box about the size of two\nsaddlebags falling to the ground in a cloud of plaster dust.\nMichel followed it down and cracked the seal on the box with his knife.\nHe opened it cautiously, his face away from the lid until he was sure it\nwasn’t booby-trapped, and finally took a good look at the contents.\nHe gave a low whistle. “Taniel, you were really damn ready for\nanything, weren’t you?”\nMichel found a large stable in the shadow of the plateau, a steady stream of\ncarts moving in and out or parking in the street outside with loads of\npumpkins or barrels or boxed uniforms for the Dynize Army. A sign over\nthe door said HALFORD HAULING, and from what Michel had heard, the\nold man who owned the place had made himself a fortune just since the\ninvasion by negotiating with some quartermaster to move supplies for a\nDynize regiment.\nMichel was dressed in a laborer’s cotton suit—his favorite disguise—\nand walked straight in through the front gate of the stable with hat in hand.\nDozens of workers repaired wheels, transferred cargo, or tended to horses,\nand no one seemed to notice him as he slipped into one of the cart-parking\nstalls and found a young man checking equipment in the corner.\nThe young man had thinned since Michel saw him last, five or six\nmonths ago. His wisp of a beard was still a disgrace, and he still had that\nplain face of someone who could disappear into the crowd, but he moved\nwith a purpose and confidence that he had not possessed before.\n“Hello, Dristan,” Michel said, leaning against the wall beside him.\nDristan frowned and looked up at Michel, blinking a few times, clearly\nlost in his own thoughts. “Do I know you?”\n“We only met briefly,” Michel said, “but we have met. I heard you drive\nfor Halford now. That’s quite a step up from where you were before the\ninvasion.”\nDristan got a sort of worried look, staring at Michel sidelong like one\nmight a long-absent cousin who’d come looking for money. “I think you\nhave the wrong man.”\nMichel pointed at Dristan playfully. “That, I do not. The last time we\nsaw each other, I was getting pissed at six o’clock in the morning in a pub\nin Lower Landfall.”\nThe color suddenly drained from Dristan’s face. He looked around\nquickly for anyone who might overhear, and he hissed at Michel. “Pit, I\nremember you now. You’re the spy who was supposed to train me.”\n“I am.”\n“Well, you listen to me. You never came looking for me, so I got a good\njob with Halford, and they just gave me my own route, and I don’t want\nnothing to do with anything spy business. The Blackhats are finished in this\ntown, and I won’t let you take me down with them. Hear me?”"

Hear me?”\nMichel held his hands up. “I’m not trying to take you down with\nanything, Dristan. I just want to hire you for a single route.”\n“I just said I won’t do anything for the Blackhats.”\n“I’m not with the Blackhats anymore. Pit, I changed sides just like old\nHalford, and the Dynize are making me rich. Ask around. There’s plenty of\ngossip about a Blackhat turncoat.”\nDristan eyed Michel with suspicion. “What do you want?”\n“Like I said, I want to hire you. I just need someone to move a package\nfor me.”\n“If you need something hauled, you go inside and talk to Halford.”\n“No, I won’t. I want you. I already checked your route. You’re taking\nsupplies to the front about forty miles north of here. It’s, what, a week\nround-trip?”\nDristan swallowed hard.\nMichel continued. “Next time you go north, I want you to take two\npeople with you. They can hide in your supplies, or ride out front with you,\nor however the pit you want to do it. Just get them past the Dynize\ncheckpoints with that little official card I know you carry around with you.”\n“And what do I get in return? Are you going to blackmail me?”\n“Not in the slightest. I’m not with the Blackhats anymore, and have no\ninterest in forcing you to do anything illicit.”\n“That sounds damned illicit to me.”\nMichel gave a casual shrug. “Eh. It’s more of a convenience than\nanything else.” He produced a heavy little bag from his pocket and thumbed\nfour shiny yellow disks, each about the size of a coin, into one hand. They\nwere blank, without stamp or any national marking. He tossed one to\nDristan, who caught it and stared for a moment before Michel said, “Solid\ngold. Ask a jeweler, if you want to confirm it. Four now, six when you get\nyour passengers past the last checkpoint. And one more if you don’t ask any\ndamn questions.”\nDristan continued to stare at the coin. “I could buy this whole stable\nwith what you’re offering.”\n“Right now,” Michel said, “convenience is more important to me than\ngold. Do we have a deal?”\nDristan bit the coin, muttering under his breath. “I’m allowed to take\nwhichever of the next four shipments suits me. You give me a day, and we\nhave a deal.”\nMichel lifted one finger. “I’ll have to get back to you on the day.”\n“You have big damn balls coming back here after storming out without an\nexplanation the other day.” Ichtracia stood in her bedroom, watching\nMichel through puffy, red eyes that told him she’d either been crying or\nsmoking mala. By the smell, it was the latter. She wore a dressing gown and\nslippers, and a discarded dress on the floor told Michel that she’d recently\nreturned from somewhere.\nMichel gave her his most charming smile, fingering the small bottle of\nchloroform wrapped in a rag in his left pocket. “I apologize.”\n“I should turn you inside out.”"

There was a defeated tone to her voice. He immediately began\nto worry, hoping this had nothing to do with him. Perhaps she’d just\nreturned from another fight with her grandfather?\n“I came to apologize and give you an explanation,” Michel said.\nIchtracia took a deep breath, and he waited for her to dismiss him\nwithout a word, but she let it out in a frustrated sigh instead. “I’d like to\nknow why you left the other day. I could have used company.”\nThat tone was full of more hurt than Michel cared to plumb, and he\nfound himself shocked by the rawness of it. He circled around her toward\nthe window, glancing out into the street. “Are we alone?”\n“I sent the footmen out to get me dinner. We have a few minutes.”\n“Will you promise that you won’t turn me inside out until I’ve explained\nmyself fully?”\nIchtracia’s eyes narrowed. She wasn’t wearing her gloves, but Michel\ndidn’t know if they weren’t in the pockets of her dressing gown. He touched\nthe bottle of chloroform and wondered just how stupid he really was. “I\npromise,” she said.\n“I need to clarify something first. Your nickname is Mara, correct?”\n“It is,” she said through clenched teeth.\n“Is that a common nickname?” He already knew the answer to that.\n“Why would it be?” There was genuine anger in her eyes, and Michel\nmoved on quickly.\n“I need to know, because I’m here for a woman named Mara.” Michel’s\nheart began to hammer, and he wondered if perhaps he was committing\nsuicide. If there was even the slightest chance he was wrong, he might be\ndead before he could reach the door. “Look, I didn’t come to the Dynize to\nget back at the Blackhats who betrayed me. I’ve never even worked for\nthem—not really. I came to the Dynize because my boss told me to retrieve\na woman named Mara and get her out of Landfall. He told me that she was\nin incredible danger.”\nIchtracia’s jaw tightened and she reached into her pockets, producing her\ngloves. Michel leapt toward her, hands out front. “Wait! You were in\ncontact with a woman, probably with sorcery, until about a year ago. You\nspoke to her again perhaps”—he grimaced—“two months ago. She may\nhave warned you I was coming, she may not have, but I was sent to get you\nout.”\nIchtracia’s eyes wandered the room, her brow furrowing, and the gloves\nslipped from her fingers back into her pockets. She took several steps over\nto the bed and sat down, staring at her hands for a moment before looking\nup at Michel. “I shouldn’t have ever answered when she spoke to me,” she\nsaid softly.\n“But you did.”\n“Because she seemed to know me. I told her things—too many things—\nand I have betrayed my country.”\nThis was not going well, not at all. “I don’t know what you told her. All"

All\nI know is that I was asked to get you out. Look, I had no idea you were the\nwoman I was sent for until I overheard Sedial the other day. I’ve been\nlooking in vain for Mara, only to find out I’m sharing her bed. That’s why I\nleft. I had to gather my thoughts.”\n“I see.” Ichtracia’s eyes focused on Michel. “You were sent to save me?”\nHer voice took on an angry tone that Michel didn’t like. “That’s what I\nwas told.”\n“From what?” she demanded.\n“I have no idea. Danger. That’s all I know.”\nIchtracia leaned toward him. “You have nowhere to take me. These are\nmy people. I never told the voice in my head that I wanted to leave. I just\ntold her I didn’t want war.”\n“Well, she thinks you’re going to get killed if you stay in Landfall.”\n“And that’s supposed to surprise me?” she asked flatly. Michel had the\nsudden realization that there was something going on beneath the surface\nthat he knew nothing about. More information that Taniel had withheld? Or\nsomething new? “My whole purpose is to die.”\nDid she mean as a tool of the state? Michel took a half step toward her,\nlowering his hands until he could feel the bottle in his pocket. He grimaced\ninwardly. No, he was not that stupid. Beyond the danger of chloroforming a\nPrivileged, pulling shit like that would destroy any trust that had grown\nbetween them the last few days. He realized, quite suddenly, that he\ncouldn’t do that.\n“Who are you?” she asked him.\nThe question took him off guard. He considered a dozen lies, and\ndiscarded them. “You know most of it already. I really am named Michel\nBravis, and I really was a Blackhat Gold Rose. But I truly work for a man\ncalled the Red Hand, and I infiltrated the Blackhats on his behalf. I was still\nmaintaining my cover when he asked me to get you out of the city safely.\nMy cover was blown by one of my fellow Blackhats, so I came to the\nDynize.”\n“You’re going to betray them. Us.” She laughed bitterly. “I suppose\nyou’re not betraying us if you never really were one of us. Yaret adopted\nyou into his Household. Do you know what that even means? He took a\nforeign spy under his wing.”\nMichel swallowed. That trust was long gone. “I’m not betraying anyone.\nI won’t steal anything. I won’t kill people. I’m not even looking for\ninformation. I’m here for you.”\n“Betrayal doesn’t just involve murder, Michel,” Ichtracia said. “This\nwhole thing with you dismantling the Blackhats—it was a front?”\n“It was.” He hesitated before continuing. “It actually felt pretty good.\nI’ve had to work with those assholes for years while they torture and\nsubjugate my people.”\nIchtracia, through her anger, actually cracked a smile. “I knew you were\ninteresting.”"

If she went for them, he might have no choice but to tackle\nher and try the chloroform. He really didn’t want to do that.\n“All of that, just to get to me,” she scoffed quietly. “I’m not leaving,\nMichel. I spoke with a voice in my head. I told her some information, sure.\nBut I never told her I wanted to join some Palo freedom fighter off in the\njungle.”\nMichel’s heart began to fall. This was it. A complete failure to finish his\nmission and—surprisingly hurtful—the end of his relationship with\nIchtracia. He would probably be dead in a couple of minutes.\n“What will you do?” she asked.\n“If you refuse to come?”\n“Yes.”\n“I’ll look for the next opportunity to leave. I’m not going to force you to\ncome with me.”\nShe snorted. “As if you could.” In a moment of bravado, Michel tossed\nher the bottle of chloroform. She caught it, looked at the label, and stared\ndaggers at him. “You were going to use this on me?”\n“I considered it. I’m supposed to do a job. But I like you a little more\nthan that. So if you don’t want to come, I’ll just tell my boss that I couldn’t\nfind you. If you let me walk out of here, that is.”\nIchtracia passed the chloroform back and forth between her hands, then\nheld it to the light to look at the liquid inside. “I’ve heard this is\nunpleasant.”\n“It’s not enjoyable.” Michel wondered if he should make a run for it.\n“Look, how about this: I stay here three more days. I help Yaret find that\nprick je Tura and put an end to the Blackhats in Landfall for good. If at the\nend of those three days you change your mind, I have a way for us to\ndisappear. If not … then I’ll go alone.”\n“I won’t change my mind. These are my people, Michel. I have a duty to\nfulfill.”\n“Consider it.” Careful to make no sudden moves, Michel headed toward\nthe door. He was out in the street before he allowed himself to breathe\nagain. Three days. Three ways this could go: Either he’d get out alone, he’d\nget out with Ichtracia, or she’d hand him over to be tortured to death.\nWhat a way to live.\nCHAPTER 57\nW\ne’ve run out of land,” Jackal reported.\nStyke sat in his saddle, frowning at a grassy hill on the horizon.

Beyond it were the high cliffs\nof the Hammer and a steep drop down to the beach, and then the narrow\nocean that separated Fatrasta from Dynize.\n“Are we close?” Styke asked. “I want to find this thing and be done with\nit as quickly as possible. It’s only a matter of time before a Dynize army\npicks up our trail. I …” He trailed off, noticing that Ka-poel’s eyes did not\nleave the horizon. Without a sign, she flipped her reins and headed toward\nthe coast.\nStyke rolled his tongue along his teeth, feeling the myriad of old aches\nand pains that seemed to accompany every day at this age. “Where’s she\ngoing?” he asked Celine.\n“I don’t know.” Even Celine seemed confused, and Styke sensed that\nthere was something wrong in the stiff way that Ka-poel rode.\nHe leaned toward Jackal. “Keep a close eye on her, and a hand on your\ncarbine.”\n“You expect me to shoot her?” Jackal seemed surprised by this.\n“I don’t know what to expect. These godstones are unpredictable.” He\ntook a deep breath, trying to fill his nostrils with sorcery, but the only whiff\nhe got was the scent of Ka-poel’s coppery power. He waited, uncertain, for\nseveral minutes before finally heading after her. Jackal and Celine followed.\nThey reached the cliff tops, only to find that Ka-poel had abandoned her\nhorse and taken a steep path down to the beach. Styke watched her pick her\nway through the rocks.\n“Do we wait for her to come back up?” Jackal asked.\n“Maybe the thing is on the beach,” Styke grunted, swinging out of the\nsaddle.\nThey descended to the beach and joined Ka-poel on the shoreline, who\nwas standing with her shoes discarded and her feet in the surf. The water\nlapped at Styke’s boots, and he watched the side of her face with a growing\nconcern. Her expression was stonelike, devoid of her usual bemusement or\ndefiance. Her eyes seemed distant, as if she were deep in some kind of\ndream. He breathed in again, trying to read her sorcery, but nothing about\nthe coppery smell had changed.\nJackal clung to the base of the cliff, watching Ka-poel as one might\nwatch a rabid dog.

Ka-poel responded to the touch mechanically, her thumb\ngently stroking the back of Celine’s wrist, and Styke suddenly felt like an\ninvader in a private moment. He clenched his jaw, letting his irritation\noverwhelm his discomfort, and stepped up beside the two of them. “What\nare you looking at, girl?” he asked Ka-poel.\nKa-poel’s brow furrowed, and she lifted one hand and touched her\nthumb to her chest. Styke recognized her symbol for “I” and the hesitation\nthat followed it.\n“What is it?” he urged.\nKa-poel’s hands moved. Celine tilted her head to the side, watching as\nKa-poel repeated the short phrase several times in a row. Celine’s face grew\nconcerned, and she glanced quickly at Styke and then back at Ka-poel.\n“What is she saying?” Styke asked, his mouth suddenly dry.\n“It’s … it’s not here,” Celine translated.\nStyke felt a knot form in the pit of his stomach, irritation turning to\ndisbelief, to anger in the flash of an instant. “What do you mean it’s not\nhere?”\nKa-poel spread her hands. I don’t know.\nStyke grabbed her shoulder, and she suddenly leapt away from him,\nstumbling through the surf and falling into a defensive stance, her passive\nface suddenly angry. That coppery scent grew stronger in Styke’s nostrils,\nand he became very conscious of Celine standing between them.\n“Whoa,” he said gently, reaching out and taking Celine by the hand. He\npushed her behind him, jaw tight, then set one hand on the hilt of his boz\nknife. “Explain.”\nKa-poel looked from Styke to Jackal and back again, no doubt taking\nnote of the carbine in Jackal’s hands. There was something suddenly feral in\nher eyes that Styke did not like—that he had not seen before. Her gaze\nshifted slowly to Celine, and that feral look seemed to fade. She\nstraightened; then her hands flashed, repeating the phrase from a moment\nago. Then she continued.\n“It’s not here,” Celine translated. “I was wrong. My … compass was\nwrong. This godstone is not in Fatrasta.”\nStyke resisted the urge to take a half step closer. “Then where have you\nbeen leading us?”\n“Toward the godstone.”\n“You just said it’s not in Fatrasta …” Styke trailed off, realization setting\nin. He turned toward the western horizon, staring across the ocean in the\ndirection she’d been facing when they reached the beach. “The third\ngodstone is in Dynize?”\nKa-poel gave a short nod.\nStyke thought of all the soldiers who’d died to get them here—of the\nlancers who’d fallen, of the new recruits who’d been butchered by a\nvengeful Dynize cuirassier, and of his own wounds he’d gathered on the\njourney. He bit his tongue, hard, clamping down on his rage, and considered\nhaving Taniel Two-shot come after him if he staved Ka-poel’s head in this\nvery instant.\n“How long have you known?” he managed when he finally allowed"

Or any time\nsince as we rode deeper into enemy territory?”\nKa-poel’s anger and defiance finally flagged, her gaze falling. “I needed\nto be sure.”\n“So … what?” Styke raised his hands, then let them fall at his sides\nagain. He paced in the surf. “Your internal compass, this thing that’s been\nleading as many as two thousand men across a continent at war, is off? By\nwhat? A thousand miles?”\n“More like five hundred, I think.”\nStyke scoffed. Five hundred miles. He pointed to the ocean, finally\ntaking that half step forward. “I can’t ride my lancers across an ocean!\nUnless you’re hiding something beyond that blood magic, I don’t think you\ncan do anything to change that. Can you?” He paused, feeling suddenly lost.\nAll this time, all these lives. For nothing. “Can you?” he whispered.\nKa-poel shook her head.\nStyke climbed back up the cliffs, leaving Jackal to keep an eye on\nCeline. By the time he reached the top, his mind was made up, his resolve\nstrengthened. He found Ibana and Gustar waiting for him, while the lancers\nprepared a camp just beneath the rise of the hill, where they couldn’t be\nspotted by passing ships.\n“Pack it up,” he said quietly.\nIbana’s eyebrows rose. “Excuse me?”\n“We’re going back. The blood sorcerer was wrong. The godstone lies\nbeyond the ocean.”\nBoth Ibana and Gustar stared at him, working their jaws, coming to\nterms with this news. “Beyond the ocean?” Gustar asked, rubbing a hand\nacross the stubble on his cheek.\n“That’s what I said, isn’t it?” Styke couldn’t feel anything but anger\nright now, and he fought the urge to go find Amrec, take Celine, and ride off\nbefore anyone could stop him. He wondered if he should just do that—if\nthis dream of a reborn Mad Lancers was just a fool’s errand.\nHe shouldered Gustar out of the way, heading toward Amrec. He heard\nboots behind him, and Ibana say, in a warning tone, “Don’t meddle with\nhim in this mood.”\nGustar snatched him by the arm a moment later. Styke whirled, his boz\nknife coming to hand, and snatched Gustar up by the front of his jacket.\n“Pack,” Styke ordered.\n“Ben,” Ibana warned.\nStyke looked at Ibana, then lowered his eyes to Gustar. The Riflejack\nmet the gaze. He could see resolve there, and questions, and a hint of fear.\nBut Gustar did not shake or shy away. Styke set him down and shoved him,\nputting up his knife. He took several steps before the hopelessness seized\nhim. It began in his chest like a spike of cold iron and quickly overwhelmed\nhim, until his steps became staggered and he was forced to sit on the closest\nrock, his head falling into his hands."

It began in his chest like a spike of cold iron and quickly overwhelmed\nhim, until his steps became staggered and he was forced to sit on the closest\nrock, his head falling into his hands.\n“Pack everything back up,” Styke said again. “Leave the bone-eye. She\ncan find her own way back.”\nIbana joined Gustar, and the two of them stared down at Styke. He could\nfeel their eyes on his shoulders. “Back where?” Ibana asked.\nStyke gave a half shrug, unwilling to raise his head. He’d seen plenty of\nmen have a breakdown on the field of battle. He’d never experienced one\nhimself, and the very idea of him sitting here fighting back tears,\nimmobilized by hopelessness, almost made him laugh. He was Mad Ben\nStyke, and a ninety-pound woman leading his army astray had cut him off\nat the knees.\nHe wished Ibana and Gustar would go away.\n“Back to Landfall,” he answered. He gestured at Gustar without looking\nup. “We’ll deliver you and yours back to Lady Flint. It’s the least I can do.”\n“And then?” Gustar asked.\n“And then we’ll do what we do best. We’ll slaughter our way back and\nforth across Fatrasta until either the invaders are dead or we are.”\nThere was a measured silence. “That sounds … directionless,” Gustar\nsaid gently.\n“It worked for us before,” Styke said.\nIbana sighed, pacing back and forth. Styke knew she would have words\nfor him later, when they were out of earshot of the men. He wasn’t looking\nforward to it.\n“Well, sir …” Something changed in Gustar’s voice, and Styke glanced\nup to find him standing at attention. “It’s been a pleasure serving under you.\nI appreciate the offer, but the Riflejack cavalry will take our leave. Good\nday, sir.” Gustar snapped a salute and spun on his heel, heading toward his\nmen.\nStyke exchanged a glance with Ibana. “What the pit is he going on\nabout? Gustar! Get back here.”\nGustar froze. Hesitantly, he returned to Styke, giving him a shallow\nsmile and straightening his jacket where Styke had clutched it. “Yes, sir?”\nStyke put his elbows on his knees, looking up at Gustar, fighting against\nhis despair and shushing the little voice that told him to let Gustar walk\naway. “Where are you going?”\n“To fulfill our duty, sir.”\n“What duty?”\n“To escort Ka-poel to the godstone, sir. I was given very specific\ninstructions by Lady Flint, and I intend on carrying them out.”\nStyke shook his head in wonderment. “Did you not hear me? The\ngodstone is in Dynize. She can’t lead us to it.”\n“We’ve come this far,” Gustar said, brushing off Styke’s words. “A little\nbit of ocean between us and our goal will hardly stop the Riflejacks. There\naren’t as many of us left as I’d like—five hundred, give or take a few\ndozen. That’ll make it easier to find enough ships to commandeer to get to\nDynize.”\nStyke pointed to the ocean with his knife. “You’re going to commandeer"

That’ll make it easier to find enough ships to commandeer to get to\nDynize.”\nStyke pointed to the ocean with his knife. “You’re going to commandeer\na fleet and head to Dynize? Pit knows what’s waiting for you there!”\n“Not knowing what’s over the next hill doesn’t seem like something that\nwould bother you, sir,” Gustar said, managing to pull it off without the\nslightest condescension. Styke stared at him, wondering if maybe he had\nfinally been taken by the madness so many had accused him of over the\nyears. Gustar went on. “I’ve got orders, sir. Unless you have any other\nquestions, I’d best go let the lads know that we’re splitting off.”\nStyke waved him off, his feeling of hopelessness fouled by exasperation.\nHe shook his head, and Gustar had gone about a dozen feet before Styke\nsaid, “Why?”\n“Because I have orders, sir,” Gustar said without turning.\n“Bugger orders. You Adran pricks don’t follow orders to certain death.\nLady Flint isn’t worth that. Nobody is.”\nGustar stiffened. Slowly, steadily, he returned to Styke and squatted\ndown in front of him, like a man about to explain something to a little child.\nHe said, “Field Marshal Tamas was worth it. Lady Flint—Vlora, as most of\nus knew her when she was still a girl—she might not be quite there yet, but\nshe will be someday, of that I’m certain.” Gustar paused, as if choosing his\nwords. “Styke, we haven’t ridden across Fatrasta for you, or a blood\nsorcerer, or even for Lady Flint. We rode across Fatrasta because a god\nkilled Field Marshal Tamas and tried to destroy our country. You may keep\nthe truth of what we’re actually doing here from yours, but I don’t from\nmine. We faced the father god of them all on the battlefield, and we were\nnothing but rain in his eyes. Every one of us remembers that, and if we have\nto throw away our lives on the chance of preventing another piece-of-shit\ngodling from walking this world, we will do so. Not for you, or your\ndamned country, or to help you spread the carnage of your vengeance\nacross the continent. We’ll do it to protect our homes and loved ones. Lady\nFlint understood that. It’s why she sent us out.”\nGustar left Styke, returning to his cavalry. Styke watched him go with a\nfrustrated sigh. His eyes went to Ibana, who just shrugged and followed\nGustar without a word.\nStyke stared at the ground, letting the tip of his knife fall to the dirt and\nslowly scratching it back and forth to create parallel lines. He knew he\nshould be doing something, but he didn’t know what. Ibana would inform\nthe men. Gustar would leave. The Mad Lancers would carry on.\nHe tried to tell himself that the godstone had been a long shot anyway.\nThat even if they’d found it, there was no guarantee Ka-poel could dampen\nits power. That this whole mistake—this misled party, teetering on the edge\nof the continent—was Ka-poel’s fault."

That this whole mistake—this misled party, teetering on the edge\nof the continent—was Ka-poel’s fault.\nSo why did he feel so strongly like a failure?\nHe felt a small hand on his arm. Celine took him by the wrist, forcing\nhim to sit up, then moved his arm to one side so she could sit on his knee.\nHe had a hard time meeting her gaze.\n“Ka-poel is sorry,” Celine said.\nStyke didn’t answer her.\n“I don’t think …” Celine trailed off, then took a deep breath. “I don’t\nthink she is certain of herself. She acts confident, but I think she scares\nherself.”\n“In what way?” Styke asked petulantly.\n“Her strength. That thing she did to the cuirassiers in the forest—”\nStyke looked up sharply, cutting her off. “How did you know about\nthat?”\n“She told me. She told me that she has controlled men before—even\nhundreds at a time—but that she’s never enthralled them like that. She\nneeded answers and took control of them, and she told me that it scared\nher.”\n“Why would she tell you this?” Styke asked, trying to decide if this was\nsome sort of manipulation.\nCeline didn’t even have to consider the question. She frowned at Styke\nas if the answer was obvious. “Because she is lonely. I’m the only one she\nhas to talk to. The soldiers are frightened of her, and you treat her like a\ntool. Her love is on the other side of the continent, fighting for his life, and\nshe wants to be at his side, where she can protect him.”\nStyke thought of their meeting outside of Landfall, when he had\naccepted the commission in the Riflejacks and had sent out the order to\ngather the Mad Lancers. He had waited in that small town, wondering if his\nold comrades would come when he called, and she had appeared. She had\nsmeared his forehead with blood and then vanished on the wind.\nHe touched his forehead.\nCeline didn’t miss the gesture. “She marked you.”\n“With her sorcery?”\n“In a way. She says she will not try to control you. That she is not sure if\nshe can.”\n“Then why did she mark me?”\n“As her protector. Like Taniel.”\n“Why me?”\n“Because you’re one of the good ones.”\nStyke almost laughed. He shook his head, looking at Celine’s earnest\nface. “I’m not one of the good ones, my girl. You’ve seen it with your own\neyes. I’m no one’s protector.”\n“But you protect Fatrasta.”\n“That’s different. It’s a continent, an idea, not a person …” He trailed\noff. “I’m not going to argue semantics with you.”\nCeline took his hand in hers. “You protect me. Back in the camps, and\nsince. Sunin says that you would break a mountain over your shoulders to\nprotect me, and I believe her.”\nStyke’s eyes were suddenly misty. He dragged his sleeves across his\nface. “I would.”\n“So?

She may be powerful, but she is fragile, too. Halt the sea. Break a\nmountain. Be her protector, too.” Celine leaned forward and kissed Styke\non the cheek, then slid out of his lap and pulled on his hand in the direction\nof the camp.\nStyke stared at the blade of his knife. “We should ride off. Tonight, when\neveryone is asleep. I can take you to the Nine and build us a house in the\nmountains and let you be a kid for a few years. This isn’t a place for you.”\n“I know,” Celine said seriously. “We can do that when this is over. I\nwant you to teach me about all the horses.”\n“Shit,” Styke said, climbing to his feet. The hopelessness still weighed\nhim down, clutching at his muscles like a punch to the gut. He walked hand\nin hand with Celine, gesturing to Ibana to follow and heading toward where\nthe Riflejacks were in the middle of repacking their gear. Ka-poel stood\nnext to Gustar, holding her slate and bit of chalk. The two glanced up at\nStyke as he approached. Styke pointed at Ka-poel. “I’m still pissed at you.\nBut I made a promise, and I’ll damn well keep it. Gustar, the only place\nwe’re going to find enough ships to get to Dynize is New Starlight. Tell\nyour men to set up camp. We’ll need a lot of rest if we’re to assault the\nfortress.”\nCHAPTER 58\nI\nt’s almost ready.”\nVlora didn’t acknowledge Flerring, not immediately. She was watching\nthe preparations around the godstone from a safe distance—the other side of\nNighttime Vale. She resisted the urge to reply, It took you long enough.\nThree days had passed since the Riflejacks had arrived and Burt had given\nher his blessing. Three of the four days that it would take twenty-five\nthousand Dynize infantry to catch up with them. They had gone well past\ntheir threshold of “make a clean escape” and had fallen to “hope the Dynize\nare sufficiently confused by the destruction of the godstone that we can slip\naway in the chaos.”\nVlora finally turned her eyes to Flerring to find her vigorously\nscratching one arm.\n“The thing makes my skin itch,” Flerring explained.\n“Right. That’s why I’ve kept my distance. Is this going to work?”\n“No reason it won’t,” Flerring replied.\n“We packed its brother with enough powder to level a city without\ncausing a scratch.”\nFlerring snorted. “See, there’s your problem. You just cover it in black\npowder and light the damn thing, most of the explosive force will be lost\ngoing in every direction except toward the item itself. That’s like trying to\nknock down a wall by throwing the artillery piece at it.” She smiled across\nthe valley toward the godstone, an expression that Vlora imagined had been\non her face on more than one occasion while sizing up an enemy general.\n“No, we’ve used every ounce of blasting oil we had left.

We turned it into a\ngel and applied it to the nooks and crannies. We’ve timed seven different\nexplosions to occur in split-second intervals. This is top science, Vlora. God\nsorcery can eat my shit.”\n“I would rather not invite that kind of hubris,” Vlora replied. Her\nsoldiers were literally lined up outside of town, waiting for the order to\nhead north double time if the godstone was destroyed. If the blasting oil had\nno effect, her second plan was also ready to be put into motion—all of her\nengineers standing by with the necessary equipment to lift the godstone\nonto a series of heavy-duty carts to drag it out of town.\nAnd if that didn’t work? Prime Lektor would bring the mountain down\non top of the godstone and then stick around to hide it from the approaching\nDynize army.\nShe had planned for everything—she hoped—and in a few minutes she\nwould know what needed to happen next.\nA fear in the back of her head told her that something would go wrong.\nThat the Dynize, whom Olem’s scouts had already spotted, would arrive\ntwelve hours ahead of schedule. Or that the blasting oil would cause some\nsort of sorcerous backlash that would kill them all. Or that they’d be forced\nto run with the godstone and the Dynize would be upon them within days,\nslaughtering her outnumbered men.\n“I don’t believe in hubris,” Flerring said, breaking the silence.\nVlora turned and looked at her, staring just long enough for Flerring to\nbecome visibly uncomfortable. “Please never say that again.”\nHer attention was pulled away by the sight of a group coming up from\nYellow Creek. She didn’t have to sniff powder to pick out the people in\nattendance: Taniel, Olem, Burt, Prime Lektor, and Julene, accompanied by\nseveral of Flerring’s assistants. They joined Vlora and Flerring within a few\nminutes, and it quickly became clear that they’d been arguing for some\ntime.\n“It won’t work,” Prime Lektor said with a huff. “The powder of the\ncombined Predeii couldn’t crack one of those things two thousand years\nago. Some damned gelled explosive won’t do it, either.”\nJulene stood beside him, looking sullen and uninterested. She waved one\nof her bronze hands under Prime’s nose. “Four of you together couldn’t kill\nme, either. Then along came Kresimir and cut off my hands without\nbreaking a sweat.”\n“That’s different,” Prime insisted. “That’s powerful sorcery—the same\nkind of sorcery that’s involved here. It only proves my point.”\n“And you’ve missed hers entirely,” Taniel said quietly, rolling his eyes,\n“which is that nothing can be taken for granted.”\nPrime turned on Taniel, sizing him up for a moment in undignified\nsilence. If anything, Taniel himself was living proof of that very statement.\nVlora could see Prime swallow a pithy reply, and took more than a little\namusement by the fact that Taniel could keep someone like Prime in check.\n“You think this is going to work?”\n“I have no idea,” Taniel replied. “I can certainly hope.”"

Can we trust\nyou to do so?”\nPrime drew himself up. “I will do my part.”\n“The same way you stood up to Kresimir after he returned?” Julene\nscoffed.\nBurt circled around the group and came up to Vlora’s side, giving the\nothers a skeptical look. “You’re sure these are ancient sorcerers?” he asked\nquietly.\n“I’m sure,” Vlora replied.\n“They’ve been complaining and squabbling like children since the\nmoment I met them.”\n“They’re just like that,” Taniel said, turning his back on Prime and\nJulene. “The more you get to know the most powerful people in the world,\nthe more you realize they’re just that—powerful people. If it makes you feel\nany better, Kresimir was worse than either of them.”\n“No,” Burt said. “That does not make me feel better.”\nFlerring continued to scratch her arms, looking more and more\nperplexed. “It’s going to work,” she repeated, with somewhat less\nconfidence than before. She stared at Prime and Julene while she talked,\nclearly more uncomfortable with their presence than with even the obelisk\nshe planned on destroying. “We’re going to turn that thing to dust, then\nwe’re going to hightail it out of this city before the Dynize can catch up.”\nVlora put a hand on Flerring’s shoulder. “Just tell us when to watch.”\n“Just a few more minutes, it looks like,” Flerring said. “My boys are\ntriple-checking the detonators, and we’ll be ready to go.”\nVlora couldn’t help the thumping of her heart and hoped that her anxiety\ndidn’t show on her face. What if Prime was right? What if it proved\nimpossible to move the stone, and then he fled instead of hiding the stone\nfrom the Dynize? If the stone fell into Dynize hands, they would have\npossession of two of the three. She didn’t know exactly how bad that would\nbe, but there was a dark fear in the pit of her stomach that told her it would\nbe catastrophic.\nHer thoughts were interrupted by Flerring suddenly growing very still,\nstaring across the valley, then waving back at someone. “We’re ready,” she\nannounced.\nPrime and Julene immediately ceased their bickering, and the group fell\nout into a line, watching curiously, until Flerring motioned to them. “You,\nuh, should probably all get behind those rocks,” she told them.\n“We’re awfully far away,” Taniel said doubtfully.\nBurt was already following Flerring toward some boulders, and Vlora\nand Olem were right behind her. “Trust me,” Vlora told him. “If Flerring\nsays to duck, then we duck.”\nWithin a few moments they were all situated under the cover of a pair of"

Vlora turned her\nattention toward two of Flerring’s assistants, who were still within throwing\ndistance of the stone. They were, she realized, following a long cord down\nto the outlet of the valley before taking refuge clear around the other side of\nthe rock faces that guarded the entrance to the vale. Vlora took a small hit\nof powder, watching carefully for a few tense moments before a bright flash\nsuddenly flared from the assistants’ hiding spot.\nThe flash whipped along the ground with astonishing speed, following\nthe cord up toward the godstone. It sped across the valley, then up the path.\nThe explosions were nothing like the eruption of gunpowder. Instead of a\nboom followed by inky smoke, there was an ear-shattering crack. As\nFlerring had warned, there were seven distinct explosions. They happened\nso closely to one another that even Vlora’s sorcery-enhanced senses could\nbarely tell them apart. Dust was sent in every direction, allowing Vlora to\nfollow the force of the explosion across the valley as rocks scattered and\nleaves were blown off trees. She grabbed Olem and pulled him down with\nher, hiding behind the boulder while the entire side of the valley was\npeppered with stones thrown over a half mile away. A rock the size of her\nhead struck just a few yards behind them, smoking from the blast.\n“Holy shit,” Burt said.\nVlora lifted her head to peer through the haze, trying to see what had\nhappened to the godstone. As the air began to clear, she felt her heart fall.\n“Nothing happened,” she said.\nBeside her, Taniel was also squinting toward the godstone. He shook his\nhead and suddenly lifted himself up and over the boulder, taking off at a\nrun. Vlora was about to let him go when she saw what he must have seen—\nsomething had happened. Without a word to the others, she took off after\nhim.\nThe whole group was gathered around the stone within ten minutes.\nVlora walked around and around it, unable to stop grinning like an idiot.\nThe obelisk had been shattered into three distinct pieces. The smallest\nwas the cap—a pyramid-shaped stone around four feet in diameter. The rest\nof the stone had broken in half, lengthwise, and the pieces now rested with\nabout a two-inch gap between them.\nFlerring slapped her hand victoriously on the capstone. “Ancient\nsorcery, meet modern science.”\nPrime Lektor stood back about twenty paces, staring at the godstone\nwith a mix of fascination and horror, as if expecting the stone to reassemble\nitself at any moment. He seemed at a loss for words until Flerring spoke, to\nwhich he replied, “It’s not exactly dust.”\n“It cracked along the seams,” Flerring said, tracing her fingers along the\nbreak between the two halves of the main obelisk. “Just as planned. There\nwere two deep grooves cut along fault lines in the rock, and we focused\nmost of the explosion there.” She tapped a section of the capstone where a"

But considering\nhow you were talking about that sorcery, I think we did pretty good.”\nSlowly, Vlora felt her smile fade. She took a step toward the stone and\ngently laid a hand on the surface. She felt a pulse, like the beating of a\nheart, touching her from the Else. It was an unpleasant feeling and she\nimmediately wanted to wipe her hand off and leave this place at once. She\nforced calm. “I can still sense the sorcery of the thing.”\n“So can I,” Prime Lektor said.\nTaniel and Julene both confirmed it.\n“It’s faded,” Taniel said to Flerring’s annoyed expression, “but it’s\ndefinitely still there. Do you think whoever built this thing planned for the\npossibility of it being broken?”\nVlora expected Prime to look smug, but the old sorcerer seemed baffled\nmore than anything else. “It’s possible,” he said, “but they made it so strong\nthat they must have thought it would survive anything. I doubt a god could\ncrack it.”\n“Not even Kresimir could have conceived of a man-made force as strong\nas blasting oil,” Julene said with a hint of wonder in her voice. She tapped\nher right stub against the capstone, examining it with a clinical approach.\n“Normally, when an object has been enchanted, substantial damage to it\nwill unravel the enchantment. It may be that …” She trailed off. “Ah, I see.”\n“What is it?” Vlora demanded. Her anxiety was back, and she had gone\nfrom disappointment to elation and back again so quickly in the last quarter\nof an hour that she just wanted to know what the pit was going on.\nJulene turned and smiled smugly at Prime. “Do you see it?” she asked.\nWith some reservation, Prime shook his head.\n“Those fault lines in the stone are also fault lines in the sorcery. We\ncouldn’t see it, not when it was full strength. They must have bound the\nsorcery to the very grain of the rock. Helps make it stronger, but it also\nmakes it vulnerable. The sorcery holding the whole thing together is like an\nouter layer. We broke through that with the blasting oil, leaving three\ndistinct pieces of enchanted rock.”\n“So instead of having to deal with one godstone, we’re dealing with\nthree?” Burt asked flatly.\n“Not exactly,” Julene continued. She had perked up from her usual\ndisinterest and had even grown excited. “It’s not a godstone now, not nearly.\nThe pieces are nothing compared to the whole. I think that it could be put\nback together, given time, but—”\n“If we can separate the pieces,” Vlora finished for her. Her mind was\nalready working, pushing through a number of different plans. “Which is\nthe most powerful piece?”\n“I see it now,” Prime finally announced. “ ‘Power’ is the wrong way of\nthinking about it.

        "text": "the most powerful piece?”\n“I see it now,” Prime finally announced. “ ‘Power’ is the wrong way of\nthinking about it. The two halves of the main trunk are where the meat of\nthe sorcery is. But the capstone, though weaker, is used to connect them to\nmake the three of them greater than the sum of their parts.”\n“That’s all I need to know.” Vlora turned to Burt, her heart racing. The\nmoment she’d been waiting for—where she could see the next path she\nneeded to take—was finally here. “You told us that you had made plans to\ntake the stone north of the Ironhook Mountains if you could find it. Can you\nstill do that?”\nThe question seemed to catch everyone off guard, including Burt. Taniel\nstepped forward before Burt could respond. “Are you sure about this?” he\nasked quietly.\nVlora ignored him. “Can you?” she asked again.\nBurt eyeballed the pieces. “What do you need me to do?”\n“I want you to take the two pieces of the main trunk and take them over\nthe passes. As soon as you’re north of the mountains, separate the two\npieces. Send them to the farthest reaches of your territory, or beyond. I\ndon’t really care who ends up with them, as long as they are in two very\ndifferent places.”\n“This is madness,” Prime interjected. “We can’t trust northern savages\nwith even a fragment of the stone, let alone two-thirds.”\nBurt narrowed his eyes at the word “savages.” “Then come with us, old\nman. You want to study them so badly, then we’ll take you north with the\npieces and you can make sure they’re disposed of or hidden.”\nIt was Vlora’s turn to be surprised. “I thought you don’t allow Kressians\nnorth of the Ironhook?”\n“Like I told you before, the Dynize have changed everything, and we\nneed to make decisions quickly. Besides, I have the feeling I know what\nyour plan is, and I want insurance.”\n“What do you mean by insurance?” Taniel asked.\nBurt pointed at Prime. “This one can hide the presence of the godstones.\nIf he continues to do that, it’ll give my people plenty of time to pull the two\nbig pieces into the passes and dynamite them behind us. We’ll be long gone\nbefore the Dynize Privileged can figure out something is up.”\nOlem, who had remained silent for this entire time, suddenly spoke up,\nfixing Vlora with a pained expression. “We’re going to take the capstone,\naren’t we?”\n“And lead the Dynize on a merry chase,” Vlora confirmed, locking eyes\nwith Taniel. “We take the capstone to the coast, put it on a ship, and we\ndrop it into the deepest part of the ocean. And even if the Dynize happen to\ncatch up with us, they’ll wind up with just a fraction of what they need and\nno idea where the rest has been taken.”\nOlem considered the idea for a moment, and Vlora could see in his eyes\nthat he thought it was going to get them all killed.

He stared at the godstone,\nlooking older than Vlora remembered him, and drawing out a pang of worry\nfrom her. “All right,” he said. “But the Dynize are almost upon us. I’ll have\nour engineers up here in half an hour and we’ll be rumbling out of the town\nin two. We need to get as far away as we can before nightfall.”\nCHAPTER 59\nS\ntyke crested a hill and tugged gently on his reins, bringing Amrec—and\nthe entire column behind them—to a stop in the middle of the road. He eyed\nthe distant towers of New Starlight for a few moments, then swept his gaze\nacross the rolling hills between his own party and the city-fortress before\nbringing his looking glass to his eye to get a better look.\n“That’s a lot more crowded than when we passed here five days ago,”\nIbana commented. She sat beside Styke, her comments no doubt directed at\nthe army now camped at the base of the curtain wall that cut New Starlight\noff from the mainland. At a glance, and without a glass, any seasoned\ncampaigner would put the army at fifty thousand men or more. “That’s\ngoing to be a problem,” Ibana added. “We can’t break an entire field army,\nnot by ourselves.”\nStyke kept the glass to his eyes, frowning toward the city and sweeping\nhis gaze back and forth across the army camping outside it to make sure\nthat his head wasn’t playing tricks on him. “We may not have to.” He\nhanded Ibana the looking glass and sat back in the saddle, fiddling with his\nbig lancers’ ring.\nSlowly, Ibana’s mouth fell open. “Those are Fatrastan flags.”\n“Above the army and the city,” Styke confirmed. “I’m not mad, am I?”\n“Not about this.” Ibana handed the looking glass back. “It’s been five\ndays since we passed here, and we very clearly saw Dynize soldiers\nmanning the wall. Where did that army come from, and how the pit did they\ntake New Starlight without a siege?”\nStyke took off his ring, spat upon it, and polished it against his jacket\nbefore returning it to his finger. “I think that’s Dvory and the Third.”\n“I knew we hadn’t seen the last of him,” Ibana grunted.\n“Is this going to make our job easier or harder?” Styke asked, though he\nthought he already knew the answer.\n“Harder,” Ibana said. She swore, then continued. “If there is a fleet at\nharbor, Dvory isn’t going to give it to us. But …” She trailed off.\n“But,” Styke picked up, “I’d damn well like to know how he got here so\nfast. And how he took New Starlight.”\n“Right. Do you want me to send Jackal?”\nStyke felt uneasy. He felt that way a lot these days, dealing with Ka-poel\nand renegade cuirassiers and assassin dragonmen. But this … this felt\ndifferent to him and he couldn’t figure out why. The army was flying the\nflags of the Third. It was a whole field army, with Dvory at the head. He"

He\nignored Ibana’s question and asked his own. “You think he sold himself to\nthe Dynize?”\n“Dvory?”\n“Yeah.”\n“He’s a slimy piece of shit, but there’s no way he turned an entire field\narmy. I know dozens of good, loyal soldiers in the Third.”\nStyke chewed on the inside of his cheek. “Get me Jackal. We’re going to\ntake a closer look.”\nStyke and Jackal approached the pickets of the army camped outside of\nNew Starlight and were waved through with only a lingering glance and a\ncurious whisper. They were soon among the tents, riding down the main\nroad that led to the curtain wall and the city-fortress beyond it. Styke kept\nhis eyes and ears open, keeping Amrec at a walk, trying to shake the\nuneasiness that plagued his thoughts.\nThe army was camped at leisure, sprawled and disorganized like an\narmy resting in the spoils of a great victory—though it was clear that there\nhad been no battle to take the city. Soldiers played cards by the cookfires,\nset up ball fields out by the pickets, and stripped the area of firewood and\nedibles.\n“Are the spirits telling you anything about this?” Styke asked Jackal out\nof the corner of his mouth.\nJackal looked just as suspicious as Styke, if not more so, and he\nanswered without taking his eyes off the camp. “The spirits are fickle right\nnow. Most of them have fled from Ka-poel’s sorcery, and the ones who\nhaven’t speak in riddles. They’re … not helpful.”\n“What do you make of this?”\n“I don’t like it.”\nJackal seemed to have nothing else to add, so Styke let him be. Truth be\ntold, he couldn’t add any more himself. The circumstances of the Third\nArmy’s arrival seemed suspicious at best, sinister at worst, yet there was\nnothing about the camp that spoke to him of sedition or treachery.\nAs they neared the curtain wall, he saw a small group of men gathered\nplaying dice on a plank. One of them glanced up, did a double take, then\nsprang to his feet and jogged toward Styke. He was a thin, dark-skinned\nDeliv. He looked like he was in his forties, with a touch of gray at his\ntemples and a distinctive scar along his left cheek. “Colonel Ben Styke?” he\nasked, falling in beside Amrec.\n“That’s me.”\n“Colonel Willen,” the man introduced himself. “I saw you at a distance\nback near Belltower but I never got the chance to meet you. I’m with the\nSeventy-Fourth Rifles. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Styke.”\nStyke pulled on the reins and turned to look down at Willen. “Pleasure is\nmine,” he said slowly. The name sounded vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t\nplace the face. “Mind telling me what’s going on here?”\n“What do you mean?” Willen seemed genuinely perplexed by the\nquestion.\n“I mean that five days ago, I rode past New Starlight and saw Dynize"

I come back this way and the city is held by our side, without any\nsign of a struggle.”\n“Ah!” Willen’s grin widened. “Well, sir, oddest bit of luck. I’ll tell you,\nwe weren’t all that far behind—we arrived just yesterday morning to find\nthe citadel completely abandoned. No ships in harbor, no spies hiding in the\nwalls. Just an empty husk of a place stripped of supplies.”\nStyke leaned on his saddle horn. “You’re joking.” No ships. That would\nmake it damned hard to get to Dynize.\n“Not at all! I’ll tell you, it’s the damnedest thing. We had orders to take\nthe city as quickly as possible, but it was empty.”\n“Do you know why?”\n“I’m not one to question fortune, but …” Willen searched his jacket,\nproduced a tin of tobacco, and tucked a wad into the corner of his mouth\nbefore continuing. “We came across half a brigade of Dynize cavalry\nslaughtered in the Hock—I’m guessing now that it was your doing—and\nour best guess is that the Dynize holding the city were spooked and decided\nto flee.”\nStyke bit his tongue, holding back a dozen reasons why the Dynize\nwouldn’t have fled just because of some dead cuirassiers. He looked up at\nthe nearby curtain wall and the high towers of New Starlight beyond it, then\nglanced to the eastern horizon. “Perhaps,” he said. “Perhaps not. Maybe\nthey got wind of a field army on the way and decided they couldn’t hold the\nfortress against it.” It seemed like the only probable reason for abandoning\nNew Starlight. Perhaps Styke was just being paranoid. “Tell me, did the\nDynize spike the fortress guns when they left?”\n“I’m not sure,” Willen replied. “I can ask.”\n“Do so. Where is Dvory?”\n“Ah. The general is in the citadel. His personal company is holding it.”\n“Taking the choice beds for himself, I suppose.”\n“A general’s prerogative,” Willen said demurely. “If you’d like, I’ll take\nyou to him.”\n“No need, I …” Styke hesitated, exchanging a glance with Jackal.\n“Actually, that would be wonderful.”\n“Hold on, I’ll fetch my horse.”\nWithin a few minutes, Colonel Willen was riding beside them as they\nheaded toward the fortress. They passed beneath the curtain wall, which\nwas staffed with guards from one of the brigades but not policed. The city-\nfortress within had been taken over by the army.\n“All the buildings were empty when we arrived,” Colonel Willen\nexplained. “As far as we’ve been able to piece together, the city was\nabandoned by the garrison the very day that word came that Landfall had\nbeen taken. The people fled soon after, leaving it abandoned to be picked up\nby the Dynize.”\n“That’s a shame,” Styke said, watching a company of soldiers march\npast in the street.\nWillen spat out a wad of tobacco. “Agreed.

New Starlight isn’t protected\nby sorcery, but the walls are strong and the guns powerful. They could have\nmade a damned good stand against any sized fleet in the area. Pity, I say,\nbut that’s what we’re here to remedy.”\n“What, exactly, are your orders?” Styke glanced sharply at Willen.\n“They were secret until we actually arrived,” Willen said. “But we were\nto march across the Hammer and take New Starlight as quickly as possible.\nNow, I believe, we’ll garrison the city and use it as a staging point to\ncleanse the Hammer.” Willen nodded toward the citadel. “General Dvory is\nmeeting with all the brigadiers and about half the colonels right now. I\nimagine we’ll have our next set of orders by tomorrow.”\nStyke debated his next options. If there were no ships here, then the\ncitadel was useless to the Mad Lancers. His best bet might be to ride back\nto Belltower and use the good graces he’d earned with the city to\ncommandeer a small fleet. In which case, he should turn around right now\nand ride back to camp. He didn’t need Dvory getting overly curious about\nhis goals.\n“Why the urgency?” he asked Willen.\n“Hmm?”\n“You were told to march across the Hammer and take Starlight as\nquickly as possible. Why? Did you even bring enough artillery to take the\ncitadel?”\n“Only just—about the artillery, that is. We have a battery of twelve-\npounders and six batteries of six-pounders. As far as the speed?” Willen\nshrugged. “The orders came directly from Lindet herself. One does not\nquestion Lindet’s orders.”\nThey reached the main door of the citadel only to find it closed. Styke\nrode Amrec right up to the door and gave it a shove. It was locked. He\ncraned his neck, looking up to the murder holes for some sign of a guard\ndetail.\n“I say there!” Willen called, cupping his hands around his mouth. “I say\nthere! Colonel Willen to see General Dvory. Open the doors!”\nThey were greeted by silence. Jackal rode back fifty yards, looking\ntoward the top of the walls. “I don’t see anyone,” he shouted.\nWillen scowled at the door as if he might open it by annoyance alone.\n“Everyone must be at the general’s meeting.”\n“Strange,” Styke muttered, feeling his uneasiness deepen.\nThey waited for a sign of life from within the citadel for nearly fifteen\nminutes until Willen finally shook his head. “I’ll send men around to the\nother gates to find a way in,” he assured him. “Dvory’s damned bodyguard\nare too good to open the door, and they’ll hear it from me. Can I escort you\nback to your men?”\n“We’re camped down the coast,” Styke said. “To the east.

My sister is their commanding officer.”\n“Do me a favor. Get them out into the countryside. The Dynize might\nhave sailed away, but they might also be lurking out there somewhere.”\nWillen sucked on his teeth, obviously reluctant. “General Dvory gave\nthe men an informal leave while we wait for our new orders. My sister\nwon’t be eager to send her boys out too early.” He paused, looking up at the\ncitadel. “I’ll convince her,” he added.\n“Good.”\nStyke nodded good-bye and turned Amrec back toward the mainland.\nThey were out of earshot when Jackal said in a low voice, “You told him we\nwere camped to the east. You don’t trust him?”\n“I don’t want Dvory to know where we are,” Styke replied.\nIbana met them about a mile outside the curtain wall. “I was just about\nto come looking for you. Is everything all right?”\n“I’m not sure,” Styke said with the shake of his head. “I want you and\nGustar to send out our best scouts. Scour the area.”\n“What are we looking for?”\n“Dynize.”\n“A lot? A few?”\nStyke glanced back toward the citadel one more time. He thought he\nspotted someone in a yellow jacket on the walls of the citadel, but by the\ntime he found his looking glass the person had disappeared. “I don’t know.\nLook for anything suspicious. No fires tonight. Tell the men to be ready to\nfight or flee at a moment’s notice.”\nCHAPTER 60\nV\nlora sat on horseback, watching as rows of Riflejacks marched past her\nalong the winding, treacherous foothills of the Ironhook Mountains. Less\nthan fifty hours had passed since Flerring had cracked the godstone, and\neven with a swift departure from Yellow Creek they were only thirty miles\nor so east of the town. Supply wagons—and the big oxcart carrying the\ncapstone—slowed them down, as did the rough terrain itself. Their only\nsaving grace was that the men themselves were relatively fresh from days\nloitering outside of Yellow Creek.\nBut an army could only move as quickly as its slowest piece, and in this\ncase it was the capstone. Sixteen extra oxen and a whole company of\nsoldiers and engineers stood by to push or pull the wagon through mud or\nup steep embankments, to repair broken wheels or switch out tired animals.\nThey worked with efficiency found nowhere else in the world, and yet it\nstill wasn’t enough.\n“Where’s Colonel Olem?” Vlora asked one of her aides, eyeing a\nparticularly steep part of the road up ahead. The capstone would be along\nsoon, and the engineers would have to deal with that hill, slowing down the\nwhole army even further.\n“I think he’s coming up just behind us, ma’am,” the aide answered."

She caught his eye and he broke\naway, mounting up and coming over to join her.\n“We just had word from our scouts,” he reported before she could speak.\n“The Dynize are coming up on us quickly—there’s a full brigade just a\ncouple hours behind us.”\nVlora swore. “How the pit did they catch up so quickly? Didn’t they at\nleast head to Yellow Creek?”\n“They didn’t.” Olem unfolded a hand-drawn map of the region and held\nit where Vlora could see. “As far as we can tell, they changed directions at\nthis road here, heading to cut us off. Either they had better scouts than we\nexpected or their Privileged were able to sense the capstone moving east\nand they made some quick assumptions.”\nVlora tried to look on the bright side. “They’ve taken the bait.”\n“That they have. By the time they catch us, Burt will have the rest of the\ngodstone up in the Ironhook passes. No chance of the Dynize following\nthem up there.”\nIt was, Vlora had to admit, a terribly satisfying thing to know that she’d\noutmaneuvered Ka-Sedial once more. It took an enormous amount of\nanxiety off her chest. However, she didn’t need to remind herself that the\nDynize could still slaughter her and all of her men. Saving the world from a\nDynize god had been her first priority. Now she needed to get her people\nback to Adro in one piece, and Olem had not said “if” they catch us, but\nrather implied “when.” “Do we have any chance of outrunning them?” she\nasked quietly.\nOlem looked toward the engineers, his expression souring. “I think we\ncan stay ahead of them if we keep moving, it’s just that …”\n“Don’t lie to me,” Vlora told him.\nOlem glanced away, grimacing. “Dragging this capstone with us, we\nhave no chance of staying ahead of the Dynize. As long as we’re in the\nfoothills, we can block the roads and keep them from flanking us, but as\nsoon as we break out onto the plains, we’ll be surrounded by five brigades\nof infantry.”\nVlora tried to keep from spiraling into a well of despair. “I’ve gotten us\nall killed, haven’t I?”\n“I’m sure you’ll think of something,” Olem said confidently.\n“That kind of pressure isn’t exactly helpful.”\n“Hasn’t stopped you before.”\nShe wanted to slap that reassuring grin off his face. “If we live through\nthis, my love, please make me retire.”\n“I’ll do my best.”\nVlora turned to watch as the cart with the capstone was manuevered up\nthe steep hill on the road ahead of them, and was pleasantly surprised when\nnone of the ropes snapped or the oxen stumbled.

She\nwondered what Tamas would have done in this situation, and realized she’d\nbeen with him in a tangle not so dissimilar during the Adran-Kez War. Had\nthe odds been better, or worse? She couldn’t quite remember.\n“How hard will it be for the Dynize to get around us?”\n“While we’re on these foothill roads?” Olem asked. “Fairly difficult.”\n“Good. Tell the engineers I want them to keep that wagon going as\nquickly as possible, no matter what the rest of the army does.”\n“You intend to stop and fight?” Olem asked with surprise.\n“ ‘Stop’ is a poor word for what I plan. We’re going to bloody their\nnoses a little, and see what kind of sorcerous support they have. Fetch me\nTaniel, Norrine, and Davd.”\nVlora listened to the screaming of horses as she lined up her next shot.\nFinding a proper line of sight in these foothills was next to impossible. It\ntook climbing a tree on the next ridge over just to be able to witness the\nambush the Riflejack rear had arranged for the Dynize vanguard. The\nambush itself was in full swing—six hundred of her riflemen firing\nstaggered volleys into a column of dragoons. The column went back down\nthe valley for as far as Vlora could see, and had clearly not expected to run\ninto the Riflejacks so quickly. Once the firing had begun, they had milled\nfor almost a minute, the front line pushed ahead by the advancing column\nbehind them, before charging up the hill toward her Riflejacks.\nThe dragoons died by the score in that charge, but Vlora forced herself\nto ignore them and kept her eyes on the column behind the battle. Her\nsenses ablaze with a powder trance, she watched as word of the ambush\nwas passed back beyond the curve of the next hill. She kept her gaze there,\nwatching, waiting for the logical Dynize response.\nIt came within about two minutes. A Dynize Privileged, white gloves\nalready on, appeared from down the column, his bodyguard shoving their\nway through the dragoons as he attempted to make his way forward to deal\nwith the ambush. A Privileged of reasonable power could do enough\ndamage to her rear guard to allow his dragoons to advance. If he had a lot of\npower, he might be able to brush them aside single-handedly.\nVlora had no interest in finding out. She braced the barrel of her rifle on\nthe branch in front of her as she focused on the Privileged. She opened her\nthird eye, letting out a small gasp as the world turned into a black-and-white\nlandscape with a few pastel brushes of sorcery dabbed across it. The\nPrivileged glowed brightly in the Else, forcing Vlora to blink at the\nradiance. It took a few moments to notice that the Privileged had not come\nunprepared for this eventuality—that there was a half dome of hardened air\njust a few inches in front of him. It would be very difficult to punch\nthrough, and impossible to shoot around for all but the most skilled of\npowder mages."

She also glowed in the Else, and Vlora\nhad seen enough bone-eyes by now to know them by their aura. The\nPrivileged was focused on the battle ahead, no doubt trusting his shield of\nair, while the bone-eye seemed focused inward.

Several hundred dragoons already littered the\nroad, further slowing their compatriots. Vlora’s Riflejacks worked with\nmechanical precision, firing staggered volleys into whatever came next. It\nwas utter suicide on the part of the dragoons—unless, of course, they were\nsimply buying time for their Privileged to reach the front and lend them a\nhand.\nVlora readjusted her grip, took a long, steady breath, and breathed out as\nshe squeezed the trigger. As the bullet flew from the barrel of her rifle, she\nburned powder charges in her kit, adding extra strength to the shot so that it\nwould soar straight and true across nearly a thousand yards of open terrain.\nAs it approached the enemy, she nudged the bullet down and to the right.\nThe bullet skimmed the outer layer of the Privileged’s shield of hardened\nair and slammed into the bone-eye sitting next to him, snapping her head\nback and sending her tumbling from the saddle.\nThe Privileged whirled, watching his companion fall, right as a bullet\ntore through the base of his spine from the opposite direction. Another\nbullet killed the captain of the Privileged’s guard, while two more bullets\ndowned nearby officers.\nVlora allowed herself a victorious smile, glancing across the valley to\nwhere Taniel hid on the hillside opposite her. Somewhere to his left were\nDavd and Norrine, but Vlora didn’t take the time to pinpoint them before\nturning her gaze back to the battle.\nThe Dynize faltered, the courage their bone-eye supplied suddenly gone.\nSome tried to flee back down the column, though there was no space for\nthem to go, while others abandoned their horses and took cover in\nstreambeds and ditches. Vlora found Olem standing with her rear guard,\nkeeping them in check so that they held their ground. More than a few of\nthem would want to press an attack, but Vlora had no interest in taking a\nsingle step back toward Yellow Creek.\nThe trap had drawn out the brigade’s Privileged and bone-eye, and Vlora\npulled a mirror out of her pocket, flashing it toward Olem. He nodded\ntoward her, giving an order to pull back. Let the Dynize stumble over their\ndead and wonder when the next ambush would come.

It\nwas, alarmingly, coming from behind her.\nShe swung her rifle around and over a branch, shifting her position so\nthat she could face toward the crest of the ridge behind her. To her surprise,\nshe saw well over a hundred Dynize cavalry in their shining breastplates\nmount the ridge and fall into line. She swore to herself angrily, wondering\nwhat damned goat track they had found to be able to flank the Riflejack\nposition. The dragoons hadn’t just been buying time for their Privileged—\nthey’d been buying time for their cuirassiers as well.\nThe charge was not an ideal one—through a screen of trees that hid the\ncuirassiers from the Riflejacks, across a tiny streambed, and then over a\nrocky field. Not ideal, but certainly possible, and with success it might be\nable to shatter her rear guard.\nThe cuirassiers finished falling into line, and their officer raised his\nsword.\n“Piss and shit,” Vlora growled. She dropped her rifle to the ground,\nhoping it wasn’t damaged in the fall, and awkwardly pulled her pistol. Just\nas the officer lowered his sword, she pulled the trigger, floating a bullet fifty\nyards and, with an extra flare of powder, put a neat hole through his\nbreastplate.\nNone of his cuirassiers seemed to notice him fall as they plunged over\nthe lip of the ridge, charging through the screen of trees without a word,\nwhile the attention of the Riflejacks was split between shooting dragoon\nstragglers and preparing to pull back.\nVlora shouted for Olem across the valley, but the noise was lost among\nthe screams of men and horses down on the road. She swore again, reaching\nout with her senses, and set off the powder carried by the six closest\ncuirassiers. The kickback of the sorcery almost knocked her off her branch,\nbut the blast had the intended effect—causing the cuirassiers to falter, and\nOlem and the rear guard to look toward their left.\nWith her rifle dropped, Vlora could do nothing but watch as Olem\nshouted, waving his sword in the air as he kicked riflemen into a loose line\nand gave the order to fix bayonets. It came not a second too soon, as the\nDynize cuirassiers slammed into the reeling Riflejacks. Vlora’s heart leapt\nas Olem went down beneath the swinging sword of a cuirassier, and the line\nwas broken by the sheer power of the charge.\nTaking her eyes off the fight, she glanced beneath her and leapt from her\nhiding spot, hitting the rocky ground hard and rolling into a crouch.\nFetching her rifle and leaving her hat behind, she sprinted toward this new\nbattle, fearing the worst.\nShe reached the road in time to see the last of the cuirassiers pulled from\nhis horse and butchered by angry riflemen.

The length of their entrenchment\nwas a scene of chaos, with horses and soldiers dead and dying in a hundred-\nyard swath. She could see in an instant that the cuirassiers had simply\nbrought too few men. With an extra hundred they might have completely\ndislodged the rear guard, and even without them their charge had been\ndevastating. Her rear guard was still reeling from the hit, officers attempting\nto organize their men back into ranks in case the dragoons mounted another\nattack.\nA dragoon charge did not come. Vlora found Olem lying in the mud,\nblinking at the sky, his brow caked in blood. She dropped to her knees\nbeside him, overcome by relief when his eyes immediately focused on her.\n“Are you all right?” she asked.\n“I … I think so. Caught a horse’s knee to the face. Does it look bad?”\nIt did. “You’ve had worse.”\nOlem struggled to stand up, and Vlora put her arm beneath his shoulder\nto get him back to his feet so that they could survey the damage. “The\ndragoons are pressing,” Olem commented.\n“Too many dead clogging the road,” Vlora responded. “They won’t be\nable to mount another charge at this point. All their cards were in that\ncuirassier charge.”\n“Pit, that scared the shit out of me. Damned good thinking, detonating\nsome powder. Otherwise they might have hit us before we even saw them.”\nVlora didn’t feel as if she’d added much of anything to that fight. They\nshould have seen that possible flanking maneuver and been ready for it.\nFrankly, she was furious with herself for overlooking it. “Looks like our\nboys are pretty mauled. We need to grab our wounded and fall back, double\ntime.”\n“Agreed.” Olem pushed Vlora away, testing his footing, then headed\ndown the road shouting orders as if he wasn’t still bleeding heavily from his\nforehead. Vlora grabbed a nearby infantryman, pointing at Olem.\n“Find the colonel a surgeon. Make sure he gets stitched up within five\nminutes,” she ordered.\nVlora spotted Taniel coming down the side of the opposite valley from\nher, his rifle slung over one shoulder. He stopped beside a dead cuirassier,\nwatching one of the horses panicking in a nearby bush, before finishing his\nwalk toward Vlora. “Those cuirassiers just came out of nowhere,” he\ncommented. “I was so focused on the battle, I didn’t see them until you\ncaused a ruckus with their powder.”\n“I barely saw them in time myself, and they were right behind me,”\nVlora responded. “I’m lucky one didn’t spot me and put a bullet in my\nback.” She shook her head, staring bleakly at the carnage one more time.\nThis was supposed to be a way of discouraging the Dynize—clog the road,\nkill a few hundred of them, draw out their sorcery support, and then flee.\nInstead, the Dynize had managed to flank them in mere minutes. “Whoever"

The cap won’t do them any damned\ngood. If we need to drop it, we drop it.”\n“It might do them some good,” Taniel said hesitantly. “It’s still potent\nold sorcery.”\n“It’s not worth the lives of my men,” Vlora insisted.\nTheir argument was cut off by the arrival of one of Vlora’s scouts. It was\na young woman, dusty and glassy-eyed from a hard ride, her horse worked\ninto a lather. The woman didn’t bother to salute before barking out her\nreport: “Ma’am, we’ve just caught sight of another Dynize army.”\nVlora’s head snapped up. “Where?”\n“To our southeast. Two brigades, coming on quick. They’re going to cut\noff our escape the moment we get out of the foothills.”\nCHAPTER 61\nT\nhousands of Dynize soldiers flooded every known entrance to the\ncatacombs in the Landfall Plateau at four o’clock in the morning. It was an\nimpressive display, carried out with a precision that Michel found almost\nstartling. Hundreds of copies of the catacomb maps were made in the course\nof just a couple of days, each one sectioned into squares drawn in different-\ncolored ink and assigned to a company of soldiers. The companies were\ndivided into platoons, each one of which was equipped with lanterns, pole-\narms, pistols, swords, and a box of colored string that an infantryman would\nunravel as they searched the tunnels to mark that they’d passed through.\nMichel watched as a platoon in their turquoise uniforms and steel\nbreastplates hammered the lock off the iron-bar door in the basement of an\nold church not far from the capitol building and rushed down through the\nchurch’s cellar of ossuaries and into the darkness below.\nMichel held a lantern and a pistol, and he watched the last of the soldiers\ndisappear with growing trepidation. He wasn’t entirely certain which he\nfeared more: cornering je Tura in some cave where a load of soldiers would\ndie trying to bring him down or not finding je Tura at all.\n“Claustrophobic?” Tenik asked.\n“Not particularly,” Michel answered, “but I am not made to go into a\nplace without an easy exit, and instinct is a hard thing to overcome.”\n“If all these maps are right, we’ll do just fine.” Tenik was carrying a\nwhole satchel full of those maps over one shoulder—all the originals that\nMichel had found in the Millinery. Not all of them had been copied—just\nthe three with the most minute detail—and Michel wanted the rest on hand\nin case they needed to figure something out while they were deep\nunderground.\n“I am admittedly nervous about mass-produced maps done on the spur\nof the moment.”"

But we pulled in all the\nregimental cartographers to get this done. They weren’t amateurs.”\n“I sure to pit hope not. How did you manage to organize this whole\nthing so fast?” Michel glanced back up the stairs into the back of the church\nthat they now stood beneath. He could hear voices up there: people shouting\ncommands or asking for updates. The church was a sort of command center,\nand Michel and Tenik and the two platoons accompanying them were a\n“mobile” version of that command center sent to search the area directly\nbeneath the capitol building.\nA new squad of soldiers rushed down the stairs into the basement,\nsqueezing in between Tenik and Michel and following their comrades into\nthe darkness.\n“Seriously, I’m damned impressed.”\nTenik waited until the soldiers had all disappeared before answering in a\nlow voice. “We got all this organized because most of these men know\nsomeone who’s died to je Tura’s bombs over the last month. Revenge is a\npowerful motivator.”\nThey were joined by another squad, this one gathering around Michel\nand Tenik in the narrow space in the church basement. Michel glanced from\nface to face, noting the eagerness and hoping that none of them turned out\nto be claustrophobic. He took the satchel of maps from Tenik and looped it\nover his shoulder, then plucked one of them out, unrolled it, and turned it\nover on itself until he could hold it easily draped over one arm.\n“All right,” he said, “you’ve all been briefed by Tenik here, so I’ll make\nthis short: The capitol building sits directly over a series of chambers that\nprobably date back to the old Dynize Empire. We’re going to sweep those\nchambers, looking for hidden alcoves and nooks where a single man might\nhide.” He swept his finger over a route he’d planned out in pencil, then\nasked Tenik to hold his lantern closer. “Be on the lookout for any indication\nthat someone had been living down here: bedding, tools, gunpowder, even\nfootprints in the dust. If the walls begin to close in on you, tell one of us and\nthen trace the string back up to the surface. Got it?”\n“Yes, sir,” a dozen voices responded.\n“Good.”\nMichel set aside the map and searched his valise for another—one of the\nolder, more detailed maps that they didn’t have copies of. He spread it\nacross his lap and traced their route out one more time, making sure that\nthey weren’t going to miss anything by depending on the newer maps. The\ntunnels lined up with their plans admirably, and he was just about to roll the\nmap back up when something caught his eye. It was a label on one of the\ndozens of chambers that they’d be searching, each of them marked by the\ncartographer with a single word in a language Michel wasn’t familiar with.\nIt was labeled MARA.\nThe sight of the word made Michel’s heart jump. “Let’s go,” he told the\nsoldiers."

Must be old\nDynize.”\n“Do you know what it means?”\n“Haven’t a clue. Yaret might know.”\nThe discovery troubled Michel as they followed their escort into the\ntunnels. He tried to shake it off, and had gone less than two hundred yards\nwhen he decided that perhaps he should rethink the answer to that Are you\nclaustrophobic? question that he’d been asked a few minutes before. The\ntunnel they followed sloped gently downward, the rock slick with moisture\nand lichen, the light of Michel’s lantern playing across the uneven shadows.\nIt was so narrow that he could touch both sides and the ceiling without\nreaching.\nMichel had always thought of the catacombs beneath Landfall as\nsomething akin to a sewage system—in that everyone knew they were\nthere, but no one really liked to talk about them. Some people were afraid\nof tunnel collapses, others that they were haunted. Most agreed that it was\nbest not to disturb the rest of the ancient dead.\nThey followed a zigzag pattern through a series of cross-halls and small\nrooms filled with ossuaries, full-blown tombs, and even bones packed into\nalcoves so tightly that not one of them could be dislodged. He reined in the\nsoldiers every few minutes, moving slowly and consulting his maps by\nlantern light even though he had memorized their route. When it came to\nsomeplace as disorienting as the catacombs, he didn’t want to make a\nmistake.\nTheir journey consisted of long stretches of moody silence, the soldiers\ntense and irritable, punctuated by the distant echoes of other searchers.\nAfter some time their squad vanguard finally called a stop, and Michel and\nTenik were called up to examine an immensely heavy iron grate blocking\ntheir path. Michel pressed his face to the grate and noted the way the light\nfrom his lantern disappeared into the darkness beyond without revealing\nany walls.\n“I’ve heard stories that the Kez sealed up a lot of these tunnels decades\nbefore I was born,” he said. “We’ve reached the first chamber. Get to\nblasting.”\nOne of the soldiers kicked at the grate. “It’s solid, sir. If the room is still\nclosed up, can’t we count out the chances of them being enemy bases?”\n“These chambers have more than one entrance,” Tenik said. “We’re\ngoing to do a proper job of this.”\nMichel retreated a few hundred yards back up the tunnel while the squad\nsapper worked. He listened to echoes coming down to them from a side\npassage, and once even saw the bobbing of a lantern. He wondered if je\nTura was down here somewhere, having caught wind of the manhunt and\ndesperately trying to avoid the searchers.\nHe caught Tenik’s eye. “I’ve been thinking.”\n“Oh?” Tenik asked.\n“We’ve been down here for over an hour and we’ve only seen one single\nother squad.”\n“So?”"

I get the\nfeeling the catacombs are bigger than we considered.”\n“Not much we can do about it now.”\nMichel thought about some of the maps in his satchel—the ones there’d\nbeen no time to copy. Many of them were half-finished, sometimes\ncontradicting the more complete maps and other times hinting at the idea\nthat there were tunnels that went far deeper, down below the base of the\nplateau. He wrestled with a fear that they’d just drive je Tura down into the\nfarthest reaches without a prayer of catching him.\nThere was a distant boom, and Michel and Tenik headed back to their\nsquad to find the path ahead of them cleared—the heavy grate blasted along\nthe edges and pushed off to one side of the tunnel. Michel ducked through\nthe remains and into the first of the chambers, raising his lantern to get a\ngood look.\nTenik gave a low whistle. “These aren’t chambers, Michel. These are\ndamned temples.”\nHe didn’t seem far off. The rooms were much larger than the map\nindicated, with vaulted, cavernous ceilings and a width that was large\nenough to accommodate most theaters. The floors were covered in dust, the\nwalls slick. At second glance, Michel realized that it may very well be a\ntheater or conference room of some kind, as apparent seating had been\ncarved into about two-thirds of the room in a half-moon shape.\nThere was no evidence that anyone had been in here for a long time.\nMichel studied the floor, looking for footprints in the dust, mildly\ndisappointed that he didn’t find any beyond those of the soldiers who’d just\nentered with him. He crossed clear to the other side, where he found, per his\nmap, a narrow tunnel leading to the next chamber.\n“Chamber clear,” one of the soldiers reported.\n“Then we keep moving,” Michel responded.\nMichel and his squad searched chamber after chamber for hours. They\nmoved methodically, following a path he’d laid out on his map so that they\ncould search crisscrossing chambers without the risk of someone getting\nbehind them. They found a dozen paths leading back to the general maze of\nthe catacombs, most of which were still sealed off. Occasionally they came\nacross one that had rusted through or been blasted in decades ago by\nlooters.\nIt was almost noon when Michel checked his pocket watch and called\nfor a halt in one of the larger chambers they’d attended. This one appeared\nto be some sort of communal living space, complete with old notches at\nregular intervals along the walls where torches might have been lit a\nthousand years ago.\nMichel was exhausted and more than a little emotionally frayed. Even\nwithout any real excitement, he found the inky darkness battering to his\nnerves. The uncertainty was taking its toll, and every time they entered a\nnew chamber, he wondered if they would trigger some ancient trap or\nencounter a collapsed tunnel or lose a man to madness in the claustrophobic\narea.

Add onto all of that his exhaustion—they’d searched all through the\nnight, for ten hours straight—and he felt ready to collapse.\n“Do we have a depth?” Tenik asked him quietly. Michel could see the\nsame exhaustion in Tenik’s eyes, and took a moment to pull out his maps,\nlooking carefully at the chambers. Decades ago a thoughtful cartographer\nhad given a depth for each chamber, but many of the numbers were worn\noff, and Michel had no idea how accurate the legible ones actually were.\n“Eighty feet below street level,” Michel responded.\nTenik ran a hand through his hair. “Damn. It feels like we’re so much\ndeeper. I can throw a rock eighty feet.”\nMichel echoed the sentiment. To be so close to the city—probably just\nfifty or sixty feet below the basement floor of the capitol building—and yet\nbe so removed from the world made him feel a little crazy. He looked\naround at each of the soldiers, wondering who would snap first, and curious\nif anyone from any of the other search parties had snapped already. He let\nhis eyes fall to the box of string held by a soldier, forcing himself to\nremember that if he began to get twitchy, he could just follow that string\nright back to the surface.\nIt was just fine. No chance of being trapped down here.\n“Do you think someone else has caught him already?” a soldier asked.\n“If they have,” Michel said, “they’re supposed to send someone down\nour string to find us and let us know. But that could take two hours on its\nown.” He cleared his throat and checked his watch. “We’ve got about an\nhour left until we’re meant to head out. We’re only about”—he unrolled his\nmap and traced their path—“eight hundred yards from an exit.” He pointed\nat the closest doorway into the next chamber. “We’ll head in that direction.\nDon’t worry, fellas, we’ll be back in the sunlight before too long.”\nThere were a few “yes, sirs,” but most of them sullenly stared at their\nfeet. Michel wasn’t sure whether they were as frayed as he was from the\noppressive rock or if they were tired and angry at not having found je Tura.\nHe opened his mouth, trying to think of something to say to cheer them up,\nwhen a voice came to him from across the chamber.\n“Sir,” the voice echoed in Dynize. “I think I’ve found something.”\nMichel exchanged a glance with Tenik and got to his feet, heading\nacross the wide space toward a lantern light off in the distance. He soon\nfound a Dynize soldier standing beside a stone table of some sort, just a few\nfeet from a separate exit that headed in the opposite direction from their\nplanned path. She smiled tightly at him and nodded to the ground.\nThe dust outside the tunnel entrance had been disturbed recently, enough\nthat Michel couldn’t make out many single footprints, just a trail leading\ndown into the darkness. Inside the tunnel, stashed behind the table the\nsoldier stood beside, were six small barrels of black powder. Michel nudged\neach of them with his toe. All but one was empty. He knelt beside them,"

He looked up at Tenik, then the soldier who’d made the discovery.\n“Ma’am,” Michel said, “you may have just found Landfall’s number-one\nenemy of the state. Everyone on your feet!

The camp appeared in\nmuch the same order as the night before, with everyone relaxed and playing\ngames to pass the time, but Styke thought he could sense a tension among\nthe men that hadn’t been there before.\n“Styke,” Willen greeted him, riding up and falling in beside Amrec.\n“Willen,” Styke returned with a nod.\n“Where is your Palo man?”\n“Jackal? He’s with my scouts.”\n“Good, good. My sister sent some of her best out last night, and more\nthis morning. General Dvory assures us that the Dynize have abandoned the\narea, but I think having some of us out there will put the men at ease.”\nWillen seemed anything but at ease. His jacket was unbuttoned at the collar\nand he looked like he hadn’t slept well, with hair mussed.\n“Has Dvory emerged?” Styke asked, nodding to the citadel.\n“He has not.” Willen grimaced and shifted in the saddle as he spoke.\n“Just messages. It seems that Lady Chancellor Lindet’s orders have left the\ngeneral staff in some confusion. They will remain in deliberation until they\nhave come to a consensus as to what to do next.”\nStyke considered Dvory’s assurances, as well as the lack of\ncommunication. He did not trust the bastard before, and he certainly didn’t\ntrust him now—but what could he be playing at? There was a whole field\narmy here, holding a powerful fortress on the tip of the Hammer. He had\nput the army—who clearly were still loyal Fatrastans—in an excellent\ndefensive position. If Dvory planned betrayal, what could he gain out here?\n“So I can’t talk with him yet?”\n“You can’t,” Willen replied apologetically. “I’m sure that we’ll have\nsome sort of decision by the end of the night. Dvory is a persuasive man—\nthe brigadiers will be lined up behind him before too long.”\nStyke nearly voiced his suspicions that Dvory was planning some kind\nof treachery, but decided to bite his tongue. Willen was an army man, and\nStyke doubted that he’d take well to an officer being slandered without\nevidence. But what evidence was there? Willen seemed nervous about the\nlack of communication, but he wasn’t falling apart. “Did you ever find out\nif the Dynize spiked the cannon when they left?”\n“Oh, I did at that. The cannon were not spiked. I’ll confess, that has\ngiven me some confusion. It’s the first thing we would do if we abandoned"

It’s the first thing we would do if we abandoned\na fort to the enemy.”\n“Yeah,” Styke muttered. “Me too.” Louder, he said, “Are you familiar\nwith this place at all?”\n“Some. I was stationed here for a few months just after the war. My\nsister pulled some strings to get me transferred to Little Starland.”\n“I don’t suppose you know of any way into the citadel?”\nWillen tapped the side of his chin. “I don’t. But …” He laughed to\nhimself. “Actually, I do. There are a few sea gates out on the breakers. You\ncan only reach them during low tide. The garrison uses them to clean\ndetritus off the breakers and access the lighthouse out past the bay.”\n“Tunnels?”\n“Dark, dangerous, and very wet.”\n“Can they be reached without a long swim?”\nWillen considered this. “Might be. The north sea gate comes out on the\nmainland, but it’s right into the rocks. Even at low tide, those breakers get\nhit hard enough to wash a man out to sea.”\nA bell rang high up in the citadel, turning Styke’s head. He searched for\nthe source of the sound, only to find it hidden from him by one of the\ntowers. He breathed in deeply, the scent of the sea filling his nostrils. “Is\nthere a storm coming in?”\n“Might be,” Willen replied.\n“I’m going to check. Thank you for your help.”\nStyke snapped the reins gently, allowing Amrec to carry him away from\nWillen and toward the northern shore of the Hammer. He kept his eyes on\nthe walls of the citadel as he approached, searching in vain for any sign of\nlife.\nThe bell, he realized, had awakened something in him. He couldn’t\ndetermine what, but there was a tightness in his chest that had nothing to do\nwith his recent uneasiness. No, he felt a certainty—the certainty of a storm\non the horizon or the violence of a battle—and with this certainty was a\nsense that he must act quickly. He forced the feeling down and proceeded to\nwhere the citadel met the earth and plummeted down into the ocean. Tying\nAmrec to a bush, he searched the underbrush until he found a narrow\ngroundskeeper’s trail that led down along the rocky cliff and then skirted\nthe edge of the citadel all the way to the ocean. Fetching his carbine and\nknife, he headed down the trail.\nIt was a difficult walk, but by no means impossible. He passed a narrow\nbridge leading out to a low gun platform, sitting exposed and empty with\nthree twelve-pound cannons protecting the harbor. He continued on and\nsoon found his boots crunching along the gravelly shoreline. There was a\nnarrow beach here, protected by the breakers, the sound of the ocean\ncrashing against them drowning out anything else he might hear. He\nfollowed the beach along the foundation stones of the citadel and around\none of the towers, then climbed up and over a boulder until he had a plain\nview of the docks beneath New Starlight."

They were tucked into a beach much like the one Styke\nhad just crossed, protected from the open ocean by a stretch of man-made\nbreakers. On one end of the beach a path led up into the citadel.\nStyke looked for a way to reach the docks. A small boat might do it, if\nhe could find one. Willen had been right about the ocean, though, and it was\nclear that even a strong swimmer would get dashed against the breakers at\nthe base of the citadel. He eyed those breakers, following them along the\ncourse of the steep shoreline until he spotted a grate about fifty yards from\nhis current vantage point.\nThe sea gate that Willen had told him about.\nStyke was about to climb down to the breakers when something caught\nhis eye. There was a ship coming in quickly, sailing in from the west. Styke\nsquinted into the wind and was shocked to see that it flew the sunflower\nyellow of the Fatrastan flag. Settling back onto the boulder, he watched it\ncome closer.\nIt was only when the ship was almost to the docks that he spotted more\non the horizon. Ten, twenty. Maybe even more. There were frigates,\ntransports, and ships of the line, all of Kressian design. He leaned forward,\nenthralled, wishing he had his looking glass with him. He had thought that\nthe Dynize owned this coast, and as the lead ship came up to dock and\ndropped anchor, he tried to figure out how a fleet this size could materialize\non the other side of the continent from Landfall.\nThere was a scrape of metal on stone, and Styke looked around sharply,\nsearching for the source of the sound. He thought he heard voices on the\nwind, but when he could not find them, he turned his attention back to the\nship coming in to dock. The minutes slowly ticked by and the wind picked\nup, the sky growing darker despite sundown being several hours away. Men\nscrambled through the rigging of the ship, rolling the sails, and a plank was\nrolled out.\nStyke was just about to turn around and leave when he saw a familiar\nfigure appear on deck.\nLindet.\n“Oi!” he shouted, waving both arms. There was no response, and no one\non the ship seemed to notice, his voice buried by the sound of the waves on\nthe breakers. He looked once more for a way to the docks and didn’t find\none. Irritated, he hurried down from his boulder and across the hidden\nbeach to the groundskeeper’s path.\nLindet was here. No wonder Dvory and the Third had been in a hurry.\nThis was some kind of damned rendezvous. All those ships out there—that\nwas probably all that was left of the Fatrastan fleet. They’d picked up\nLindet from the coast off Redstone and brought her down here to meet with\nthe Third, where she could take command and sweep the Hammer clear of\nDynize, just as Willen had said."

Dvory’s secrecy\nwas damned well explained away by this: Lindet didn’t want anyone to\nknow that she was taking the fight to the Dynize personally until she was on\nhand. He tried to figure out how this changed his own plans. The moment\nshe discovered his presence, she would attempt to commandeer the Mad\nLancers. If she found out about Ka-poel, that would … well, Styke wasn’t\ngoing to let her find out about Ka-poel.\nHe was about halfway up the path when he passed the narrow bridge\nleading to the gun platform, and froze in place at the sight of some fifteen\nmen—having appeared from seemingly thin air—working over the guns.\nThey cleaned the barrels, brought ammunition up from a cache in the floor,\nand pointed to the distant ships. It wasn’t the men themselves that startled\nhim so much as their appearance.\nEvery one of them wore a turquoise uniform, a morion-style helmet, and\na smooth breastplate. They had red hair and ashen freckles.\nStyke changed directions in midstep and hurled himself across the\nbridge. He was among them before they even saw him, his knife flashing,\nand within the minute, he was coated in their blood and gore. Heart\nhammering, Styke looked toward the beach, only for his view to be\nobstructed by the corner of the citadel.\nGoddamn Dvory was a traitor. This was Lindet’s rendezvous, and Dvory\nhad turned it into a death trap.\nSomewhere far above him, there was a flash in one of the citadel towers\nand then the report of a coastal gun. More followed quickly, and Styke was\nsuddenly all too aware that the Third Army was now sitting at the base of an\nenemy citadel, whose guns were being manned by Dynize. He wiped the\nblood from his face and began to run.\nCHAPTER 63\nV\nlora rode past a field of the dead and dying, listening as their moans\nseemed to keep tempo with the clip-clop of her horse’s hooves. Another\nreckless charge by Dynize dragoons, meant to do nothing more than slow\ndown her column. At a glance, there were no more than a hundred of them\n—not even close to enough to do any real damage. Their horses had already\nbeen either put down or taken, and the Adran dead buried beneath simple\nstone cairns beside the road. The Dynize—wounded and dead alike—lay\nwhere they fell and remained ignored as the Riflejack rear guard marched\npast them.\nShe wondered if anyone had bothered to tell her about this attack.\nPerhaps. She was exhausted from days of forced march, barely able to sleep\neven when she did have the time. These attacks had come so frequently that\nthey hardly warranted her attention anymore. They came at night, in the\nrain, even out in the open as the Dynize general sent his cavalry along every\ngoat path and mining trail he could find to try to flank the Riflejacks—to try\nto trip them up and force the column to slow, even for fifteen minutes at a\ntime."

Despite the larger, more cumbersome\narmy, the Dynize infantry remained just three hours behind the Riflejacks.\nVlora felt like she could barely breathe.\nUp ahead, her column snaked down through the foothills and onto a\nrelatively flat plain, where the vanguard had pulled off to the side for a few\nmoments’ rest, allowing another company to take the lead of the column.\nShe searched for Olem and was unable to find him.\nThe sound of galloping hooves made her turn to find Taniel and Norrine\ncoming up the road from the west, covered in the dust stirred up by Vlora’s\ninfantry. Norrine wore a tired but satisfied smile, and Taniel held his rifle\nacross the saddle horn. He pulled in next to Vlora and tapped on the side of\nhis head. “That’s all of them.”\n“All of who?” she asked.\n“As far as we can tell, we’ve popped every Privileged and bone-eye in\nthe Dynize Army. We’ve also killed half their senior officers.”\n“And yet still they come hard on our heels.” Vlora had meant to say that\nin her head, but it came out without her even realizing she was speaking.\nNorrine nodded. “They are … persistent.”\nVlora looked back toward the dead and dying Dynize dragoons from the\nlast ambush, unable to get rid of the weight of dread sitting in the pit of her\nstomach. “You’ve done well,” she told Norrine. “Go find some chow.”\nNorrine headed up the column, leaving Vlora and Taniel alone by the\nside of the road. “I don’t like the look on your face,” Taniel said.\n“I don’t like the fact that we can’t gain even an hour on these bastards.\nThey won’t slow down, even with their officers and sorcerers dead.” She\ngestured to the dead dragoons. “They’re throwing lives in front of us with\nas little regard as if they were tossing caltrops in a road.”\n“The zeal scares you?”\n“It terrifies me. I have a little voice in the back of my head whispering\nevery few minutes that we’re all going to die on this blasted continent.” She\nrolled her shoulders, trying to calm herself. “I’m not thrilled with the idea\nof dying, but there are worse fates. Dying, hunted like a dog … it feels like\nour campaign through northern Kez during the war all over again. Except\nthis time I’m the one responsible for all these lives.” She looked Taniel in\nthe eye. “I don’t want all these men to die here, Taniel.”\nTaniel’s expression was grim. “You’re doing the best you can.”\nShe wondered at his plans. He wasn’t an Adran, not anymore.

Vlora briefly considered grabbing Olem and attempting to run for it.\nBut who would she be if she abandoned the soldiers who so willingly\nsacrificed themselves for her?\nAnother thought crept up and touched the back of her mind. She flirted\nwith it for a moment before shoving it to one side, where it waited,\ninsistently, for her to consider it again. “I’ve got to talk with Olem,” she\ntold Taniel. She turned and followed Norrine up the column, riding past the\ndust-coated soldiers, down out of the foothills, and onto the wide field\nwhere the column ground to a halt for a brief rest.\nBeyond the field was something that her maps called Ishtari’s Crease. It\nwas a great upthrusting of rock, as severe as a church’s steeple, that ran\nnorth-to-south for about thirty miles. It varied between forty and eighty feet\ntall, and was occasionally broken by natural fissures or modern clefts\nblasted out for roadways. Beyond the Crease the land fell steeply down into\nan old-growth forest, beyond which one could just make out the distant\nplains that needed to be crossed before reaching the ocean.\nThose plains had haunted her thoughts for days like a waking nightmare.\nFlat and open, with few defensible positions, the larger Dynize field army\nwould be able to slow and surround the Riflejacks, cutting them to ribbons\nwithout the need of either tactical or sorcerous advantages. To outrun them,\nthe Riflejacks needed at least a day’s lead on their enemy. They had mere\nhours.\nVlora found Olem in a deep conference with the company’s\nquartermasters. He spotted Vlora and broke off, coming to her side, where\nhe gave her a tight smile. “We’ve sent the capstone on ahead while the\ncolumn rests. Our scouts are telling us that we won’t have to worry about\nbeing flanked by Dynize cavalry for a while—there isn’t another place to\ncross the Crease for miles, so they’ll either have to come straight up behind\nus, or wait until we’re completely through.”\nThere was a hint of suggestion in his words. It didn’t take a military\ngenius to see that the Crease was a tactician’s wet dream. The road passed\nthrough a rocky divide less than twenty yards across, easily defended by a\nfew hundred men, let alone a few thousand.\nQuietly, so as not to be overheard, she said, “We’re going to die whether\nwe fight them here or out on the plains.”\n“The thought had crossed my mind,” Olem answered.\n“I’d rather not die at all.”\n“We can attempt to negotiate.”\nVlora scoffed. “And give them time to catch up with us and maneuver?\nYou remember the negotiation before Windy River.”\n“Things might have changed. We can try to give them the capstone.”\n“Somehow, I’m not sure that will be enough.” Vlora eyed the Crease. In"

We can try to give them the capstone.”\n“Somehow, I’m not sure that will be enough.” Vlora eyed the Crease. In\nanother situation, she might have found it beautiful, in a rugged way. The\ncracked, broken rock was periodically flushed with green where a group of\nshrubs or trees had managed to eke out its existence. It wasn’t, she decided,\na terrible monument to make one’s gravestone. “If we attempt a last stand\nhere, how long will it take for the Dynize to find another crossing and come\naround behind us?”\n“A day and a half for their cavalry. Two and a half for infantry.” Olem\npaused. “There’s the option of leaving a few hundred men to defend the\npass. It would easily buy the rest of the army time to get a head start on the\nplains.”\nVlora shot Olem a glare. “You think I should ask for suicidal\nvolunteers?”\n“I’m confident we could get enough volunteers to hold the pass.” There\nwas a glint in Olem’s eye that Vlora didn’t like.\n“And I suppose you’d volunteer to lead them?” Olem clenched his jaw,\nbut did not answer. Vlora knew him well enough to see that as a yes. “Out\nof the question.” She paused. “How long do we plan on resting here?”\n“No more than a half hour, then we’ll send the vanguard through the\nCrease.”\n“Make it fifteen minutes. We need to talk again in ten, just over that\nridge over there.” She pointed to where the road passed through the Crease.\n“In private.”\n“I’ll be there.”\nVlora took her leave and headed along the column, her eyes searching\nthe faces of her soldiers as they rested on the side of the road, jackets\nunbuttoned and packs thrown to the ground. The looks of exhaustion as she\nrode past them made her heart cry out with every salute and respectful\n“General Flint” that followed her.\nThe problem, she found, was that Olem was a far more popular person\nwith the soldiers than she was. They respected her, for certain, but they\nloved Olem. And that made what she had to do next especially difficult. It\ntook her a few minutes to discover a pair of faces up near the vanguard, and\nshe dismounted and walked over to the two men lying a little off on their\nown from the main column. One was smaller, with a narrow face and\nthoughtful eyes, while the second was well over six feet tall and had the\nlanguid manner of a mastiff lying in the sun.\nThe two friends were former boxers who’d joined up with her during the\nKez Civil War. She’d used them for dirty side jobs on more than one\noccasion. “Boys,” she said, standing above them.\nThe big one, Pugh, squinted at Vlora from under his hat and then leapt to\nhis feet with a snapped salute, kicking his companion, Dez, sharply in the\nribs as he did so. “Ma’am!”\nVlora waited until they were both standing. “At ease, soldiers. I need a\nfavor.”\n“Anything for you, ma’am,” Dez responded.\n“Anything?”"

That’s worth a lot,\nma’am.”\nVlora gave them a tired smile. “First, I want you to answer a question\nwith complete honesty. I will not hold any answer you give me against you\nin any way.”\n“Of course, ma’am,” Pugh said.\n“If I and Colonel Olem were both standing in front of you and gave you\nconflicting orders, whose would you obey?”\nThe eyes of both men widened. Pugh swallowed hard. “Ma’am?”\n“Honest answers.”\n“I …” Dez said, “I suppose it would be yours, ma’am.”\n“You suppose.”\n“It would be, ma’am,” he said firmly. Pugh echoed the sentiment.\n“Good. Get some rope and meet me up on that ridge. Right there behind\nthat boulder.”\nVlora leaned against the boulder and watched as Olem, Dez, and Pugh\ntogether walked up the road toward her. She wondered whether this was a\nmistake, and forced herself to dismiss the notion. Sometimes, a thing had to\nbe done to preserve lives. She wiped a few tears from the corners of her\neyes and forced a gentle smile onto her face as the men reached her.\nOlem was already concerned. She could see it in his eyes, though he\ndidn’t want to show it in front of the other two. “What’s going on?” he\nasked her.\nShe jerked her head to the side, indicating the three men follow her\nbehind the boulder, out of the sight of eyes of the army below them. Once\nthey were secluded, she said, “Pugh, I would appreciate it if you would\ndisarm and restrain Colonel Olem.”\n“What …” Olem managed, before Pugh slipped behind him and\nwrapped Olem in a bear hug that pinned Olem’s arms to his chest. Dez\njumped forward and took Olem’s pistol, sword, and knife, before returning\nto Vlora’s side. Despite their compliance, both men looked more than a\nlittle startled by the order, and clearly expected an explanation. “What’s\ngoing on?” Olem asked through clenched teeth, his eyes full of anger and\nhurt.\nVlora took a shaky breath. “This is what’s going on: In five minutes,\nColonel Heracich is going to give the order to move out. He’ll remain in\ncommand for the next two days, while Pugh and Dez quietly trundle you\nalong with instructions not to let you out of their sight or allow you to speak\nwith anyone. At the end of those two days, you will be released, and\nHeracich will relinquish command of the Riflejacks to you.”\nOlem began to struggle. “What the pit do you mean by all of this?”\n“I mean …” Vlora heard her voice crack and turned away, unable to face\nOlem while she spoke. “I’m going to stay and defend the Crease,” she said.\n“What, on your own?”\n“Yes, on my own.” She glanced over to find Olem’s eyes wide with"

Dez tackled his legs, and he and Pugh dragged him kicking and\nstruggling back behind the rock. Together they began to bind Olem. Dez\nstuffed a rag into his mouth.\nVlora squatted next to Olem as he was restrained, unable to help the\ntears that ran down her face as he glared at her. “I’m sorry,” she told him.\n“I’m not going to let anyone else die for my ambitions—for my mistakes.\nNot the Riflejacks, and certainly not you. I know you’re going to be angry.\nPlease don’t take it out on Pugh and Dez, or Heracich. They’re only\nfollowing my orders.” She wanted to say a thousand things, but her stomach\nclenched so badly she thought she might vomit if she continued to speak. “I\nlove you, Olem.” She leaned forward, kissing him on the forehead, then\nstepped away.\n“Keep him quiet until the army has made it twenty or thirty miles,” she\ntold Pugh and Dez. “And definitely don’t say anything to my mages. If they\nask questions, refer them to Heracich.” She nodded at them, forcing a smile.\n“Thanks, boys. I hope I’ll be alive to pay you back.”\nOlem was bound at their feet, his face red and streaked with tears. The\ntwo soldiers straightened and snapped salutes. “I wish it hadn’t come to\nthis, ma’am,” Pugh said.\n“So do I,” Vlora answered.\n“It’s been an honor to serve under you,” Dez said. “I know every man in\nthe brigade would say the same. We’ll never forget you.”\n“I appreciate it. Now, get him out of here before I lose my nerve.”\nCHAPTER 64\nM\nichel followed the footsteps in the dust as the tunnel plummeted deeper\ninto the ground. It passed through several more chambers, with no\nindication that anyone had stopped in any of them. At one point, Michel\nconsulted his maps to see that he was within arm’s length of the chamber\nlabeled MARA on his map. He hesitated, peering at the dark doorway,\nwondering if an empty room thousands of years old would hold any secrets\nof value to his real mission here in Landfall.\n“On the way back,” he whispered to himself, and continued on with his\nescort.\nHe could sense the excitement of the soldiers. It was as if they’d been\nreinvigorated by the idea of catching je Tura, and they bit their lips and\nfingered their weapons.

The\nmomentum of his escort was suddenly seized by something that Michel\ncaught sight of just a few moments later.\nOne of the alcoves had a bedroll in it. Michel approached cautiously,\nlantern held high, peering into the darkness. His heart suddenly hammered\nin his chest, and he imagined je Tura himself popping out from the very\nstone to stick a sword through Michel’s belly. Beside the alcove he found a\nsmall seaman’s chest, a lantern, several tins of spare oil, and a long, round\nleather tube that he immediately recognized as a map carrier.\nHe swallowed as he poked at the bedroll, his fingers uncovering the\nshine of steel.\n“Can we be certain this is his hiding spot?” Tenik asked him quietly.\n“Search down the hall,” Michel ordered the soldiers. “Check the side\npassages. Don’t go so far that you can’t see the light of each other’s\nlanterns, and stay in pairs.”\nTenik drew his pistol. “You think he’s here now?”\nMichel lifted the bedroll to reveal, tucked to the back of the alcove, an\nold broadsword. It looked like something out of a museum, with two red\ngemstones fitted into a silver-etched hilt. The weapon was almost as long as\nMichel was tall. “Rumors have it that je Tura carries this damn thing\neverywhere. Rumors aren’t necessarily true, but he might be nearby.” He\nstopped, noticing that Tenik was peering at something in the darkness.\n“What is it?”\n“Are any of our escort behind us?”\n“I don’t think so, why?”\n“Because I swear I just saw a light in …” Tenik trailed off, and Michel\nheard a very distinctive noise that he’d heard on more than one occasion:\nthe hiss of a quick-burning fuse, zipping through the darkness toward him.\n“Everyone down!” Michel bellowed, shoving Tenik farther into the\nchamber and leaping toward the fuse, dropping his lantern as he attempted\nto stamp out the fiery little worm. It shot between his legs, and Michel\nwhirled, jumped forward with foot extended, and slammed his head directly\ninto the rock wall. He teetered and then tripped just as a blast erupted from\nthe ceiling of the chamber.\nMichel lay on the floor, ears ringing, a white flash of light embedded in his\nvision no matter how much he tried to blink it away. He moved one arm,\nthen the other, hoping that nothing was broken and not entirely certain that\nhe wasn’t half-buried in a thousand tons of rock. “Tenik!” he called, his\nown voice seemingly small and far away.\nSomething stirred in the darkness. He felt it more than he heard or saw\nit, and he searched blindly for either his pistol or his lantern. There was a\nsound—again, as if from a great distance—and then a lantern flared to light.\nHe blinked, trying to discern the light of the lantern from the light etched\ninto his vision.

It took him a moment to get his bearings; he lay against the\nwall of the tunnel, half-behind a stone table that seemed to have at least\nsomewhat protected him from the blast. To his right was the string that led\nback the way he’d come. To his left was a pile of rubble from the collapsed\nceiling of the chamber.\nMichel finally looked up into the light, still half-dazed, only to realize\nthat the lantern wasn’t being held by either Tenik or one of the soldiers. The\nface behind it was old and grizzled, a Kressian face with black hair streaked\nwith gray, pockmarked cheeks, and high-arched eyebrows that looked like\nthey were locked in permanent surprise. The man grinned down at Michel,\nlips moving, and a voice from a mile away said, “My, my, aren’t you a\nsurprise.”\n“Val je Tura?” Michel asked, suppressing a groan. His recent gunshot\nwound hurt badly. He wondered if he’d torn open the stitches.\nJe Tura walked over to the alcove and retrieved his sword. He drew it\nfrom the scabbard and lay it across his shoulder. The tip scraped the wall\nbehind him. He sat down on one of the stone tables, head tilted to the side.\n“You’ve sussed me out. Are you that traitor spy, or just an unlucky Kressian\nconscript who just happens to have his very own escort of soldiers?”\n“Would you believe me if I told you it was the second?” Michel still\nattempted to blink away the light of the explosion. He continued to feel\nthrough the rubble, looking for his own lantern, or his pistol, or some\ndamned thing to defend himself with.\n“I would not,” je Tura answered. “I got a pretty good description of you\nfrom Hendres, and you about match the bill.”\n“How is Hendres?”\n“Doing very well. Disappointed that you’re still alive.”\n“I imagine she is.”\n“She won’t be disappointed for long.” Je Tura swung his sword off his\nshoulder. He was leaner than Michel would have guessed from the stories,\nthough he was remarkably short for someone with his kind of presence.\nMichel thought he heard a groan from somewhere in the rubble, and je Tura\nsquinted toward his handiwork. “The second charge didn’t go off,” he said.\n“Not sure if I got any of your friends. But it’ll take ’em a while to dig\nthrough, and by that time I’ll be long gone.”\nMichel’s hand wrapped around a rock about the size of his fist. As je\nTura stepped toward him, he hurled the rock with all his strength. It soared\nover je Tura’s shoulder, bounced off the wall, and rolled into the dark.\nJe Tura laughed. “Is that the best you’ve got, turncoat?”\nMichel reached for another rock, but his hand touched smooth, polished\nwood. “No,” he said, pulling his pistol out of the rubble. “This is.”\nThe blast took je Tura full in the chest.

He dropped his\nsword with a clatter, then fell beside it.\nIt took Michel over a minute to get to his feet, ears still ringing. Nothing\nseemed broken, but his whole damned body hurt. It took him well over a\nminute more to reload the pistol with trembling hands and step over to je\nTura. He claimed the other’s lantern and kicked the sword away from his\nhand.\nJe Tura looked up at him balefully, clutching his chest, jaw clenched, not\nmaking a sound. Michel raised his pistol and aimed it at je Tura’s head.\n“Why’d you betray us?” je Tura demanded.\n“You say that like I was ever one of you,” Michel responded, his voice\nquiet lest someone on the other side of that pile of rubble overhear. “Don’t\nget high and mighty with me, je Tura. You’ve been bombing public spaces\nfor a month now. Killing children. Civilians. You’re a piece of shit.”\n“You haven’t seen what I’ve seen.”\nMichel considered pulling the trigger, not giving je Tura the satisfaction\nof a few last words. But his interest was piqued. “What have you seen?”\n“You know about the godstone?”\n“What of it?”\n“You know what they’re doing to try to get it working?”\n“I don’t.”\n“Well, civilians isn’t even the start of it.” Je Tura shifted, and Michel\nwatched carefully to be sure he wasn’t reaching for a weapon. He\ncontinued. “Blood sacrifices, turncoat. They’re marching prisoners and\norphans and every damn person they think won’t be missed over to that\ngreat big obelisk and slitting their throats. They hang them like pigs to bleed\nevery drop onto the surface and their Privileged and bone-eyes stand\naround. They chant and they wave their hands and they rub the blood all\nover the stone.”\nThe hair on the back of Michel’s neck stood on end. “Why should I\nbelieve you?”\n“You didn’t know, did you? I can see it from your face. These are the\npeople you signed on with, turncoat. You think they call those foxhead\nmagicians ‘blood sorcerers’ because they like the name?” je Tura laughed,\nsputtered, and coughed up blood.\n“Are you the last one?” Michel demanded. “Is anyone else down here?”\nJe Tura grinned at him, and Michel heard someone call his name through\nthat rubble. “Go to the pit,” je Tura told him.\n“You first.”\nThe echo of the shot made the ringing in Michel’s ears worse. He\nchecked to make sure je Tura was definitely dead, and went to the rubble\nwhere he noted a small space that revealed a bit of light coming through\nfrom the other side. “Is everyone all right?” he called.\n“Tenik’s in bad shape,” someone answered. “The rest of us are fine. Je\nTura?”\n“He’s dead.” Michel looked at his hands, scraped and bloody, and\nwondered if he’d even be able to walk out of here. “Look, you need to stay\nput. I can’t dig you out on my own. I’m going to head up and send down\ndiggers and a surgeon. We’ll have you out of there in an hour.” He squeezed"

We’ll have you out of there in an hour.” He squeezed\nhis eyes shut, trying not to think of Tenik buried beneath that rubble, body\nbroken from the blast that collapsed the tunnel. “Shit, I’ll have them send a\nPrivileged. Hold tight!”\nMichel hurried back up the tunnel as fast as he could manage, holding je\nTura’s lantern and following the string. He paused a few chambers over,\nlooking toward the dark room labeled MARA on his map, then looking back\ntoward his trapped escort. Swearing under his breath, he ran down that side\npassage and into MARA, where he held his lantern up high.\nAt first, the room seemed completely insignificant. It was neither the\nlargest nor the most interesting of the chambers he’d searched. It was\ncompletely empty, perfectly spherical, and there was no adornment but\ntorch recesses in the wall and a single stone slab in the center of the room.\nHe almost turned and left, but something compelled him to step over to that\nslab. He peered at the dusty stone, noting a narrow indentation that ran\naround the outside of the slab and then spilled out at the end. It reminded\nhim of the marble slabs in Emerald’s morgue—the way they were designed\nto catch blood and funnel it to the feet of the body, where it could be\ncleaned up easily.\nThis did not look like a morgue.\nWith a final glance around, Michel rushed to the chamber where his\nescort had made their detour, then followed his maps toward the closest\nexit, praying that he wouldn’t run into any more iron grates along the way.\nHe managed to make it to the surface within twenty minutes, and within\nanother ten he was at Yaret’s headquarters. He babbled instructions, calling\nfor Yaret to help Tenik, and then collapsed into a chair across from a table\ncovered in the maps of the catacombs.\nA whirlwind of activity followed. Teams of soldiers headed directly into\nthe chapel catacombs, while others went to find the spot where Michel had\nsurfaced. A Privileged was sent for. Michel remained numb, his mind barely\nworking, his eyes still seeing the flash of the explosion and his ears still\nringing.\nIt was several minutes before he realized that Yaret was watching him.\n“Je Tura is dead,” he reported.\n“You already told us,” Yaret said gently.\n“Oh. I forgot.” Michel scowled, thinking of that chamber with the\nmorgue slab that definitely wasn’t a morgue slab.\n“We’ll get him out of there as quickly as possible. You did well coming\nto us instead of trying to dig them out yourself.”\n“I …” Michel didn’t know what else to say, surprised at how distraught\nhe was over Tenik’s possible death. “I have a question. Tenik said you know\nOld Dynize.”\n“A bit,” Yaret said, clearly caught off guard.\n“Do you know the word ‘Mara’?”\n“ ‘Mara,’ ‘Mara,’” Yaret muttered. “Oh, yes. It’s the word for sacrifice.”\n“Could it be a room for sacrifice, too?”\n“I suppose it could, yes. Why do you ask?”"

        "text": "“Could it be a room for sacrifice, too?”\n“I suppose it could, yes. Why do you ask?”\nMichel pushed himself to his feet. His valise of maps was still slung\nover his shoulder, but he couldn’t organize the thought or energy to drop it.\nA thousand little pieces—information, half suspicions, and loose ends—\nsuddenly clicked together in his brain. He thought of the godstone and of je\nTura’s claim of blood sacrifice, and what little he knew of Ka-poel’s\nchildhood. “I have to go.”\n“You’re in no shape to go anywhere.”\n“It’s okay, I’m not going far.”\nCHAPTER 65\nA\nmrec’s hooves hammered the ground as Styke flew through the chaos of\nthe camp of the Third Army. Soldiers milled about, throwing themselves out\nof his way as he passed, and it was clear no one knew what was going on.\nSergeants bellowed at their infantry to fall in line; commissioned officers\nscreamed at each other in confusion. Styke slowed only enough to find\nColonel Willen near the entrance to the curtain wall.\n“What the pit is going on?” Willen demanded, looking up at the high\ntowers now firing nonstop toward the ocean. “Who are manning those\ntowers? What the pit are they firing at?”\nStyke sawed at the reins, Amrec dancing eagerly beneath him. “Dvory\nhas betrayed us. Those towers are manned by Dynize, and they’re firing at a\nFatrastan fleet.”\n“You must be joking.” Willen was slack-jawed.\n“Serious as pit. I just watched Lindet arrive. Dvory has captured her and\nnow aims to sink her fleet. Unless my guess is wrong, he’ll turn the citadel\nguns on the Third within moments and …” Styke trailed off, realizing that\nthe citadel guns would only make a dent in the fifty thousand men camped\nso close. The Third had some cannon and scaling ladders, and though\nthey’d lose thousands, they would still be able to take the citadel. Dvory\nwasn’t that stupid. He had to have backup somewhere. “Your scouts! Have\nthey reported anything suspicious?”\nWillen began to sweat visibly. “One of the outriders just came back with\nword of a large Dynize force nearby. He didn’t see them, just their trail.”\n“How far?” Styke demanded.\n“A few miles off.”\n“Damn it all, get everything in order. Turn your guns and ladders on the\ntowers and hit them hard and fast.”\n“Our generals,” Willen objected, pointing at the citadel. Realization\ndawned on his face.\n“They’ve either betrayed you or been betrayed themselves,” Styke\nroared. “The colonels are in command now, Willen. Make it count!” He\nfinally loosened his grip on the reins and Amrec was off like a shot,\ngalloping through the camp and out onto the plains within minutes. By the\ntime he reached the Mad Lancers’ camp hidden behind the hills two miles\nto the south, the entire company had already packed and was on horseback.\nIbana and Gustar met him in the center of the gathered cavalry.\n“Starlight’s guns are firing,” Ibana called."

Lindet is in the citadel, either dead or a\nprisoner, and they are firing on her fleet.”\n“Pit.” Ibana gasped. “A shitload has happened in the last few hours.”\n“You have no idea. What do our scouts say?”\nGustar cut in. “There’s a Dynize field army lurking out there. We think\nthey screened themselves from us and the Third by circling the Hock.”\n“Shit.” Styke wasn’t sure whether not running into that army was a curse\nor a blessing. “They’re going to smash the Third against the Starlight\ncitadel while the towers pulverize their rear.”\nThere was a long silence, and Styke listened to the report of cannon fire\nin the distance. With Lindet captured and the Third destroyed, the Dynize\nwould have free rein through the Hammer. They could surge north, take\nRedstone and the eastern coast, and Fatrasta was lost.\n“Do we help or run?” Ibana asked.\nStyke looked from Gustar to Ibana. He could see that they both had just\nhad the same thought as he.\n“I wouldn’t mind letting Lindet rot in a Dynize cell,” Ibana mused.\n“I can’t disagree,” Gustar grunted.\nStyke tried to agree with them. Ten years in the camps. Torture,\nstarvation, and hopelessness. Lindet deserved to reap what she had given\nhim, but Styke also knew that without Lindet, Fatrasta was doomed.\nAnd no matter how much she deserved it, he couldn’t leave his sister to\nsuch a fate.\n“Ibana, you’re with me,” he said. “Give me twenty of our best fighters.\nWrap their carbines in wax cloth and make sure everyone has a good knife.\nGustar, the Dynize will either arrive with the storm and attack at night, or\nfirst thing in the morning. Either way, I want the Mad Lancers to wait until\nthe Dynize have engaged the Third and then hit them in the flank. Can you\nlead a night charge, in the rain?”\n“That’s suicidal,” Gustar muttered.\n“Can you?”\n“I can.”\n“Good. You have command of the Mad Lancers. Ibana, tell Sunin to take\nCeline south and get her off the continent if the battle goes badly. Then find\nme my fighters. And bring me the bone-eye.”\nStyke, Ibana, Jackal, Ka-poel, and two dozen of the old core of the Mad\nLancers galloped into the camp of the Third Army. Chaos still reigned as a\nheavy wind blew in from the ocean and the black clouds approached.\nOutside the curtain wall, officers attempted to form up their companies to\nface an as-yet-unseen enemy from the mainland, while inside the curtain\nwall crews attempted to bring their cannons to bear on the citadel towers.\nStyke didn’t spot Willen as they rode through, but he did see that the\nDynize had finally showed themselves on the citadel walls.

Sharpshooters\non both sides exchanged fire, while gun crews on the interior towers\nworked to bring their own artillery to fire point-blank at the soldiers at the\nfoot of the walls. A few courageous officers led charges with ladders, only\nto be raked by musket fire from above.\nHe rode past all of this, ignoring the mighty blasts as the citadel cannon\nopened fire, closing his ears to the screams of the Third as grapeshot fell\namong them like rain. He leaned into Amrec’s neck, urging him faster, and\nlistened to the pounding of hooves as they skirted the base of the citadel\nwall.\n“Here!” he bellowed, leaping from Amrec as they reached the\ngroundskeeper’s trail at the north end of the citadel. His lancers\ndismounted, fetching their wrapped carbines, knives, and swords.\nIbana looked uneasily at the base of the citadel. “It’s going to rain soon.\nIt’ll be damned suicide to scale this wall in good weather. Pit, Ben, we\nhaven’t scaled a wall for a decade.”\n“We’re not scaling it,” Styke said, wrapping his own carbine tightly and\nmaking sure his knife was secured at his waist. “We’re going around and\nunder. The wax cloth isn’t for the rain—it’s for the ocean.”\nIbana took a half step back, her chin rising. “Pit,” she breathed. “You\nwant to fight your way up the inside of a fortified citadel?”\n“That’s what I said.”\nShe looked around at their comrades. “We should have brought\neveryone.”\n“Too many bodies,” Styke replied, throwing his carbine over his\nshoulder. “Jackal, what do the spirits tell you about what’s inside?”\nJackal pointed at Ka-poel. “She’s too close. I have one gibbering mad\nspirit sitting on my shoulder telling me we’re all going to join him. The rest\nhave fled.”\n“I always knew the dead were useless.” Styke crossed to Ka-poel,\nlowering himself to one knee so that they were eye to eye. She regarded\nhim coolly, her face placid, and he thought he saw a hint of violence in her\neyes. “Can you help us in there?” he asked.\nShe tapped the machete strapped to her thigh.\n“No,” Styke said, taking his knife and stabbing his own palm with the\ntip of the blade. He put his knife away and dabbed at the blood, holding out\nhis stained fingers to her. “This. Can you help us with this? Protection,\nstrength, speed—can you give me anything?”\nKa-poel hesitated. Slowly, she reached out and touched his bleeding\npalm. She drew back, pressing the blood to her lips, then gave him a nod.\n“Good.”\nStyke stepped to the edge of the cliff, looking down the groundskeeper’s\npath. Ibana joined him. “Are you sure about this?” she asked.\nStyke thought of the times they’d charged into enemy cannonades or\nbeen unhorsed in the middle of a sea of bayonets.

He tried to wonder if\nhe’d ever hesitated, if he’d ever shown the weakness that he now felt as he\nconsidered fighting his way through a fortress of Dynize.\n“I’m certain,” he replied.\nIbana met his eye. “Why? Lindet isn’t worth this.”\nHe remembered a time, as a child, that he’d been knocking at the gates\nof the pit with a fever. His baby sister had snuck into his room to put\ncandies beneath his tongue, despite knowing their father would beat her if\ncaught. “Not to you,” he replied, and headed down the path to the ocean.\nCHAPTER 66\nV\nlora sat on a stone to one side of the highway that ran through the crack\nin Ishtari’s Crease, humming softly to herself as she drew a whetstone\nacross the blade of her sword. Her jacket was neatly folded behind her\nmakeshift chair, her pistols and kit on top of the small bundle. Her sword\nlay across her knees as she listened to the sound the whetstone made and\nwatched as the Dynize Army emerged from the hills.\nThey snaked down onto the relatively flat bit of highway about a mile\nand a half from her position—a column of infantry six across and probably\nmiles and miles long. Officers rode horses alongside the column, with a\nhandful of scouts out ahead. From their formation, they were clearly not\nexpecting a fight, and had ordered their men to march double time to try to\ncatch up with Vlora’s smaller force. Their advance scouts had probably seen\nher army continue through Ishtari’s Crease and head down into the forest\nbelow.\nShe was running a light powder trance—enough that she could see the\nmoment one of the scouts spotted her. The column ground to a halt, officers\nwere consulted, soldiers stared in her direction through looking glasses.\nShe’d changed into an old pair of crimson trousers, so they probably\nwondered what the pit a single Adran soldier was doing out here alone.\nShe wondered how much time their hesitancy would cost them. Scouts\nwere dispatched heading north and south along the Crease, no doubt\nlooking for a trap. The general in charge of this field army had grown wary\nof her ambushes.\nIt made her smile.\nIt was almost a half hour until the column began to move again. It\nprowled forward, rolling toward her as inexorably as a boulder down a\nmountain but at a maddeningly slow pace. Though she tried to maintain her\noutward calm, her muscles cried out for the fight to start—for the beginning\nof the end. It reminded her of sitting in a theater next to Taniel, Bo, and\nTamas, waiting for the most anticipated play of the season to begin while\nshe clutched her handbill and hoped—in that way teenagers do—that the\nlead actor would look her way during the performance.\nEvery minute or so, Vlora took another hit of powder.

She increased the\ndosage by a tiny amount each time, until her senses practically hummed\nwith all the information flowing through them. She could hear the wings of\nevery bug for two hundred yards, smell every flower, feel the tiniest speck\nof dust on the tips of her fingers. Her hands felt as if they were trembling,\nbut every time she held them out to look, they were steady as steel.\nShe was so focused on the distant tramp of Dynize boots that she did not\nhear a single set of footsteps in the gravel behind her until they were almost\nupon her. She turned slightly, grasping the hilt of her sword. She wondered\nif a Dynize assassin had managed to sneak around her, or if Olem had\nescaped his ropes and come to try to talk her out of this.\n“There are simpler ways to kill yourself, you know.”\nVlora looked up at Taniel as he came to stand beside her. “Shouldn’t you\nbe with the capstone?” she asked.\n“Shouldn’t you?” Taniel’s eyes were on the approaching Dynize column.\nThey’d be here in less than ten minutes.\n“I have other responsibilities.”\nTaniel snorted. “If you were facing down a company, I’d think you\nheroic. But you can’t win this—not even a chance. There’s a whole field\narmy coming out of those hills and you will not stop them.”\n“I can slow them down.”\nTaniel was silent for several moments. “Enough to make a difference?”\n“I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think so.”\n“Look, the Riflejacks are a week’s march from the coast. Then they have\nto find a harbor and ships to get them off the continent—if there even still is\na safe harbor. If you gain them a few hours, it won’t mean a damned thing.”\nVlora lifted her sword, examining the blade for chips and flaws. It was\nin good condition, considering it had gone through several major battles\nwith her. “Did Olem send you?”\n“Nobody sent me. I caught wind and came myself. As far as I know,\nOlem is still trussed up like a pig per your orders. He’s never going to\nforgive you for this, you know.”\n“I’m not terribly worried about that. And yes, I think a few hours will\nmake a difference. My boys have orders to ditch the capstone if the Dynize\nget within five miles of them. Once the Dynize have both my corpse and the\ncapstone, they’re going to reassess this merry little chase. The northern\nFatrastan coast is still Lindet’s territory, and the Dynize will be hesitant to\nchase them too far. They might just decide to let the Riflejacks go.”\n“Are you sure they will?”\n“I am not.”\n“And you’re willing to throw your life away on that uncertainty?”\n“I am.”\nTaniel gave an unhappy sigh. “Fine.” Vlora expected him to turn and\nstride off with a huff, but instead he removed his gloves—revealing his red\nhand—and then stripped off his jacket and folded it up, setting it on top of\nVlora’s effects.\n“What the pit are you doing?” Vlora asked.\nTaniel didn’t answer her.

He undid his cuffs and collar, then rolled up his\nsleeves. “Do you remember when we first met?”\nIt was an odd question. Vlora frowned at Taniel, watching as he dabbed\nout a bit of black powder onto the back of his hand and snorted it. “I do.”\n“Do you remember the day Tamas adopted you?”\nShe forced herself to think back nearly two decades, picturing herself as\na waif of a child, roaming the ins and outs of Hrusch Avenue, trying to\nsurvive between the uncaring streets and the cruelty of the orphanage.\nShe’d met Taniel and Bo, and a cold-eyed gentleman whom she’d later\ncome to know as Field Marshal Tamas. Vlora had gotten into some trouble,\nand Tamas had dueled a nobleman to save her life. He’d taken her in, given\nher a home, and trained her to be a powder mage.\n“It’s hard to forget. It was the most terrifying and the happiest day of my\nlife.”\nTaniel gave her a peculiar look. “You’ve never been more terrified? With\nall you’ve been through?”\n“I couldn’t protect myself back then. I can now.”\nTaniel chuckled. “That’s fair. I don’t remember that day very well, but I\ndo remember that night. Tamas took us all home. We had dinner together,\nback when we still did that, and I remember thinking how I’d never seen\nanyone eat so much. You didn’t want to leave the table, and fell asleep with\nyour face next to your third helping of cherry tart. Tamas carried you to bed,\ntucked you in, and then he brought us in to see you while you were\nsleeping. Do you know what he said to us?”\nVlora’s face felt warm, her eyes moist. She blinked through a sudden\nhaze. “No, I don’t.”\n“He pointed to you and said, This is your little sister. I want you both to\npromise me that you’ll protect her, that the three of you will look out for\neach other even after I’m gone.” Taniel squinted into the distance. “I didn’t\nalways get along with Tamas, but he protected the three of us until we could\nprotect ourselves. Point being, I’m not going to leave you here to die\nalone.”\nVlora felt the color drain from her face. She stood up, facing Taniel.\n“Don’t do this. Don’t try to guilt me into coming with you so that you don’t\nhave to die with me.”\n“I’m not trying to guilt you. I’m fulfilling a promise I gave my father.”\nTaniel looked at her coldly. “And you will not deny me that.”\nVlora sank back down to her seat on the rock, staring at her sword.\nPerhaps Taniel was right. This was an enormous mistake. She didn’t mean\nto bring him into this, not when he had loved ones of his own, not when he\nhad grand plans to change the world. She looked toward the Dynize\ncolumn, the head of which was just a few hundred yards away. “It’s too late\nto run,” she whispered.\n“That it is. What’s your plan?”"

I’m a little sturdier than you.”\n“I don’t think I can keep up.”\n“Do your best.”\n“Right.” Vlora stood up, sheathed her sword, and stretched her arms and\nshoulders. A handful of advance scouts rode on ahead of the column,\ncoming straight toward her. They probably planned to pull her aside and\nquestion her while the column advanced past. Fine by her. She knelt down\non the rocky highway, pulling four powder charges from her pocket and\nplacing them between her palms, then raising her hands in front of her face\nas if in prayer. Eyes closed, she listened to the scouts ride up.\n“You there,” one spoke in bad Adran, “what are you two doing here?”\n“I’m enjoying the view. She’s praying,” Taniel responded in Palo.\nVlora could hear the confusion in the scout’s voice. “Where is your\narmy?” She pressed her palms together tightly and ground them together to\ndestroy the wrapping around the powder charges, then opened them up as if\nshe were miming a book and buried her face between them, inhaling as hard\nas she could. Powder flooded her nostrils and mouth, granules like little\nspecks of static as they touched her saliva and the inner membranes of her\nface. Her whole body vibrated with powder, every second seeming to take\nan eternity as her sorcery attempted to compensate for the barrage on her\nsenses.\nTamas had always warned them about overdosing on powder—from\neither running a trance for too long a time or imbibing too much in one go.\nShe’d flirted with the edges of her limits a few times, walking up to the\nprecipice that would either make her powder blind or outright kill her. And\nnow she ran up to that cliff and jumped off the edge.\nVlora’s eyes flew open. She reached out with her senses, across the mile\nof Dynize infantry that snaked down the road. Every six rows, she\ndetonated a single powder charge in an infantryman’s kit. It took her less\nthan a second, and within moments the column was overshadowed by\npowder smoke, the air full of the screams of the dying and the confused.\nShe turned to Taniel and nodded.\nThe scouts were dead before they could voice another word. Taniel\nbreezed past them, the very tip of his sword slick with crimson, sprinting\ninto the head of the column with a speed Vlora had never seen before. He\nwas upon them in the blink of an eye, his sword moving like the wings of a\nhummingbird, soldiers collapsing as he passed like some kind of avatar of\ndeath sweeping his scythe through the souls of the damned.\nVlora watched the dance for mere seconds before following him into the\nslaughter.\nCHAPTER 67\nM\nichel stumbled down street after street, ignoring the curious glances of\nthe afternoon traffic and occasional Dynize soldier as he made his way to"

The heavy map-carrying case pulled at his shoulder,\nand he considered dropping it in the street but couldn’t quite bring himself\nto do so until he reached the dead-end cul-de-sac where Ichtracia lived. He\npaused a few feet from the narrow garden path that led up to her front door,\npainfully adjusting his cuffs and collar. He tried to dust the debris from the\ntunnels off his shoulders, only to realize just how addled his head still was,\nand walked up to the front door. He knocked, fixing his most charming\nsmile, and prepared to greet her footman. He really hoped that she would\nwait to kill him until he’d had a chance to talk a bit.\nHis smile disappeared as the door opened to reveal a man Michel had\nnever seen before. He was enormous—easily six and a half feet tall—and as\nwide as a draft horse. Behind him, standing just inside Ichtracia’s foyer, Ka-\nSedial leaned on his cane. He eyed Michel with the same sort of eagerness\nthat a child eyed the display case of a candy store.\n“I’m looking for Ichtracia,” Michel said.\nThe brute snatched Michel by the front of his jacket before he could\neven think to yell. He felt himself swung around, held in the air like a doll\nand deposited on the floor of the foyer in the blink of an eye. The door shut\nbehind him, and Ka-Sedial leaned over Michel, his kindly old face fixed\nwith a gentle smile.\n“Ichtracia isn’t here at the moment,” Ka-Sedial said. “But you have very\ngood timing and very poor luck, Michel Bravis.”\n“I’m not sure what you’re getting at, but it’s not a great idea.” Michel\nsummoned all the bluster his aching head could manage. “I just put a bullet\nin the head of the man who’s been bombing your people. Je Tura is dead,\nand within the hour every one of your bloodthirsty soldiers is gonna know\nI’m the man who killed him. I’m going to be very popular and—”\nThe brute leaned over Michel and punched him so hard in the jaw that\nstars swam in front of his face. His mouth numb, uncertain whether any\nteeth had been knocked out, Michel could do nothing but hang limply as the\nbrute lifted him like a toy and carried him into the sitting room, where he\ntossed him unceremoniously into one of the chairs. The brute carried\nanother chair over to face Michel, and Ka-Sedial took a seat, that gentle\nsmile still fixed to his face. Despite his grandfatherly manner, his eyes\nsmoldered with an entirely different story.\n“I don’t care,” Sedial said. He raised one hand. “Don’t mistake this for\ningratitude, of course. I am pleased that je Tura is dead. He had far outlived\nhis use to me. But your name will be forgotten long before you’ve finished\nscreaming in my dungeons, so don’t try to appeal to my very small regard\nfor populism.”\nMichel stared at Sedial, uncertain what to say—uncertain if he could"

He didn’t bother looking at the brute. The brute was just a fist,\nbut Sedial was the man swinging it. Something had changed, and very\nrecently, and Michel’s luck had led him to stumble straight into Sedial.\n“Shall we wait for Ichtracia to return?” Sedial asked. “Or should we\ncontinue this discussion now? Ah! I think I hear a carriage outside.\nDelightful—we won’t have to wait long.” He turned toward the door,\nraising his eyebrows. Michel heard the front door open. “Mara, my dear,\nplease come in here.”\nIchtracia appeared in the sitting-room doorway, an irritated expression\non her face turning to shock at the sight of Michel. “What the pit are either\nof you doing here?” she asked in Adran.\n“You know I prefer you speak to me in Dynize,” Sedial chided.\n“I’ll speak in whatever I like, lizard. What are you doing here, and what\nhappened to him?” She glanced at Michel. “I thought you were with Yaret.\nThere’s already a rumor going around that you killed je Tura personally.”\nMichel swallowed, wondering if opening his mouth would get him\npunched again. “I did,” he managed.\nIchtracia’s eyes turned to her grandfather. “Then what is this?” she\ndemanded.\n“My dear,” Sedial purred, “your friend Michel is not what he seems.”\nMichel resisted the urge to say, She already knows. Sedial continued.\n“While it seems that Michel managed to find our bomber, the rest of our\nsweeps through the Landfall catacombs were not entirely devoid of success.\nWe pulled in three small cells of Blackhats still hiding down there. The first\nof those included a woman by the name of Hendres. I believe that she was\nMichel’s ex-lover.”\nMichel felt his heart fall. He knew exactly where this was going. “I need\nto talk to you,” he said to Ichtracia.\nSedial ignored him. “We didn’t even have to torture her when she was\nbrought to me. Within an hour, she had told me everything she knew about\nMichel. It seems that he doesn’t work for the Blackhats, nor even for us. He\nworks for a Palo freedom fighter by the name of the Red Hand.” Sedial\npaused to examine his nails, waiting for Ichtracia to respond. Her eyes\nflicked back and forth between Michel and Sedial, but she said nothing.\n“Ichtracia, I need to talk to—” Michel said, his voice stronger, but Sedial\ncut him off.\n“This Red Hand has been set against both us and the Fatrastans for\nyears. He’s murdered our spies, even killed our dragonmen. Apparently he\nis a powder mage, though we still haven’t managed to ascertain his true\nidentity. I’m not even sure what his motives are, and I think you and I will\nhave a long talk with your friend Michel to find out just exactly what\ninformation we’re missing.” Sedial turned to Michel, that grandfatherly\nsmile disappearing. His eyes bore into Michel with a hungry intensity."

His eyes bore into Michel with a hungry intensity.\n“Well, Michel. Shall we begin?”\n“Aren’t you just going to take my blood? Force me to talk?”\n“We will. Eventually. But I’m in no hurry. This way will be more\namusing.”\nMichel fixed his eyes on Ichtracia while she, in turn, watched her\ngrandfather as one might watch an adder. “Ichtracia,” Michel said, “I know\nwhy he calls you Mara.”\nBoth Ichtracia and Sedial stiffened. Sedial’s lip curled. “You are not to\naddress her,” he said.\n“He calls you Mara because you’re his little sacrifice,” Michel\ncontinued, talking quickly. “You’re his backup plan with the godstone. If\nkilling all those people doesn’t force it to unlock its secrets, he’s going to\nkill you.”\nSedial laughed. “You’re not telling her anything she doesn’t already\nknow. My granddaughter may be a sullen child still, but she knows her\nplace.” Despite the laugh, his voice held an edge of annoyance.\n“It’s sorcerous blood, isn’t it?” Michel said. “It’s stronger than regular\nblood. A lot stronger. He may sacrifice a Knacked or two, but that’s\nprobably not going to be enough. He has to have a Privileged, waiting on\nhis cue. Does the emperor even know that Sedial plans on using one of his\ntools that way?”\n“Shut him up,” Sedial said.\nThe brute stepped over to Michel and slammed his fist into the side of\nhis head. A bright light shot across his vision, and he almost rolled out of\nthe chair, but the brute caught him before he could fall. Michel spat blood at\nthe brute, who didn’t seem in the least bit bothered.\n“Stop hurting him,” Ichtracia said quietly.\n“What?” Sedial and Michel responded at the same time.\n“I told you to stop hurting him.”\nSedial scoffed. “He’s not your pet anymore, dear. He has betrayed the\nstate, and he has betrayed you. You’re not just going to watch as we cut him\ninto small pieces—you’re going to help keep him alive. And I intend him to\nremain alive for many, many months. Now, attend! Michel, tell me who the\nRed Hand is and why he opposes us.”\nMichel stared at Ichtracia. “I bet you weren’t the first person he called\nMara.”\n“His finger,” Sedial said calmly.\nThe brute snatched up Michel’s hand, pressing it against the table beside\nhis chair, palm down. Michel attempted to fight, battering his fist against\nthe brute’s side and struggling to pull loose, but it was like trying to fight a\nmarble statue. The brute drew a knife from his belt, slammed the tip into the\nwebbed skin between Michel’s pinkie and ring finger, and like a chef dicing\na carrot, sliced off Michel’s pinkie with a surprising crunching sound.\nMichel screamed and lurched back as the brute suddenly let go of him.\nHe clutched at his hand, blood fountaining from the little remaining stump\nof his finger.

He’d felt plenty of pain, plenty of times, but the sharp agony\nbrought him near to throwing up.\n“Let him bleed for thirty seconds,” Ka-Sedial instructed, “and then sear\nthe spot with your sorcery.” He looked at Ichtracia. “Don’t just stand there!\nPut your gloves on. If he dies tonight, I will take it out on you. You’ve had\nyour fun with Michel. Now it’s my turn.”\nSlowly, hesitantly, Ichtracia pulled her gloves out of her pockets and put\nthem on. Through Michel’s tears he could see the horror in her eyes and he\ngritted his teeth and tried to talk through the pain. “It was your big sister,\nwasn’t it? The other one he called Mara. I bet she disappeared the night he\nkilled your brother and father, didn’t she?”\nThe brute’s fist slammed across Michel’s face, and this time it did knock\nhim out of the chair. He landed on the floor, blacking out for a split second,\nblood from his hand soaking into the rug beneath him. He was suddenly\nlifted from the ground and thrown across the room, his body stopping mere\ninches from the wall. Nauseous, he tried to see through his pain and found\nhimself held aloft by Ichtracia’s sorcery on the opposite end of the room\nfrom Sedial. Ichtracia struck a pose, gloves on her hands, arms splayed like\na child holding a toy away from their parent.\n“What do you mean, disappeared?” Ichtracia demanded. She was\nstaring at Sedial, but she was speaking to Michel. “I saw the burned corpses\nof all three of them. My sister is dead.”\n“Put him back here,” Sedial said, pointing at the chair, his face screwed\nup in indignant anger. “I will take another finger every time he speaks\nwithout answering my questions.”\nMichel felt the sorcery around him tighten, and allowed all the pieces\nthat had clicked in his brain to come babbling out. “Those burned bodies\nyou saw were decoys. At least, one of them was. Your big sister didn’t die\nin that fire. She was whisked away by her nanny, taken across the ocean by\nloyalists. She disappeared, and Sedial wasn’t able to find her, so he killed\nsome poor girl and burned the body beyond recognition.”\n“Shut up,” Sedial growled.\nTears streamed down Ichtracia’s face, but her jaw was clenched in\ndetermination, her eyes burning. “Continue!”\n“You weren’t Sedial’s first choice, were you? He always knew he\nneeded the blood of someone powerful to activate the godstones, and Ka-\npoel was destined to be a powerful bone-eye. That’s why her nanny fled,\nthat’s why your father and brother died, so that she could get away. They\nknew, and they weren’t going to let your grandfather sacrifice their kin for\nhis ambitions.” Michel spoke quickly, hoping he hadn’t made any mistakes.\nHe’d only realized any of this after his confrontation with je Tura and the\nrealization that Sedial was sick enough to nickname his granddaughter"

He shook his head, as if waking from a dream, and pointed at Michel.\n“How do you even know her name?” He gestured to the brute, who began\nto stride across the room to fetch Michel.\nThe brute suddenly stopped, a confused look on his face. He frowned;\nthen his eyes widened a second before his head was suddenly stuffed into\nhis own chest by invisible forces. His arms and legs followed, blood\nerupting across the room, and within moments Sedial’s implacable\nhenchman was an unrecognizable square of flesh the size of a small travel\ntrunk, which was deposited at Sedial’s feet. Ichtracia’s expression hadn’t\nchanged through the entire event, but when her fingers stopped twitching,\nshe said to Michel in a gentle voice, “You may answer my grandfather’s\nquestion.”\nSedial rocked back on his heels, and for the first time there was real fear\nin his eyes. Michel licked his lips. “I know because Ka-poel is the one who\nsent me here to retrieve you. She is married to the Red Hand, and she’s the\nvoice in your head—the bone-eye who has been communicating with you\nover the last year.”\n“Why didn’t she tell me?” Ichtracia’s voice came out as a squeak.\n“I don’t know. Maybe she wanted to tell you in person. Maybe she\ndidn’t know if she could trust you not to tell him.” Michel nodded at Sedial.\n“But she didn’t even tell me. I just figured the whole damned thing out an\nhour ago.”\n“Did you know?” Ichtracia asked her grandfather. “Did you know she\nwas still alive?”\nSedial sputtered. “I had my suspicions. I knew she escaped with that\nbitch nanny and a few traitors, and I know that the dragonmen sent to\nFatrasta to retrieve her never returned.”\n“But did you know she was here, alive, opposing you?” Ichtracia’s voice\nrose in pitch.\n“No.”\nIchtracia squeezed her eyes shut. She drew a handkerchief from her\npocket, one hand still raised toward Michel, keeping him fixed with his feet\ndangling above the floor. She wiped her eyes and nose. “I always know\nwhen you’re lying, Sedial.”\nThe old man was suddenly thrown backward, slamming into the wall\nwith enough force to rattle the building and cause a shower of plaster to fall\nfrom the ceiling. He collapsed to the floor, moaning and cursing, and\nMichel was suddenly lowered to the ground. He almost fell himself, but\nwas held on his feet by that invisible sorcery like someone propping\nthemselves beneath his arms.

Michel tried his best not to\nwhimper, unsure whether he should look at Sedial or Ichtracia, and knowing\nhe didn’t want to look at the spongy bit of flesh that used to be Sedial’s\nhenchman. He clutched his hand, trying to stop the bleeding, trying to think\nthrough the pain. “Is he dead?”\n“I’m a monster, but I will not kill my own grandfather.”\n“So what do we do?” Michel asked her. He tried to take a step forward,\nnearly collapsed, and decided to lean against the wall for a few minutes.\n“We leave.”\n“When he wakes up, he’s going to have every Dynize within fifty miles\nlooking for us.”\nIchtracia took a deep breath, chin raised. “You’re going to get us out of\nthe city.”\nMichel thought about Dristan and the stables, wondering if the kid had\nalready left on his trip. That had been a risk back when he thought he could\nslip away quietly. Now that this had all happened—well, Michel wasn’t\nentirely sure he could get out of Landfall without killing a thousand people\non the way. “That’s easier said than done.”\n“That’s your next task,” Ichtracia said with finality. “Get us out, and\nthen take me to my sister.”\nCHAPTER 68\nT\nhe ocean swelled and crashed, smashing against the breakers at the base\nof the Starlight citadel with a rage driven by the approaching storm. Styke\npaused to wipe the water from his eyes, only for the swell to slam into him\nonce again, pummeling him against the rocks. He bent beneath the\nonslaught, his fingers gripping the icy stone, and forced himself to leap the\nnext boulder and proceed over the breakers.\nSomewhere above, the report of the cannons mixed with the thunder of\nthe surf until they were one cacophony in his ears. He turned, waiting,\ngrasping Ibana by the wrist and helping her over the stones, shoving her on\nahead of him. He tried to see through the rising swell, counting the lancers\nstill clinging to the rocks, and witnessed a wave hit Ferlisia in the back,\nslamming her into the rocks. When the wave receded, she was nowhere to\nbe seen.\n“Come on!” he bellowed, though he knew they could not hear him.\n“Keep moving!” He reached back and grabbed Ka-poel, lifting her bodily\nand shoving her along after Ibana before following himself. Out of the\ncorner of his eye he saw the rising swell and snatched Ka-poel by the\nshoulder, pulling her beneath him, then braced his knees and arms against\nthe rock as the wave hit.\nThe impact was a sensation like he had never felt, like being unhorsed in\nthe midst of battle, then having the horse rear and fall directly on him—yet\nsomehow worse. The force of the ocean shoved him, swallowed him, then\nthreatened to pull him out to sea. His muscles flexed beneath the onslaught,\nhis skin feeling as if it might burst, until the swell was gone.

He shook his\nhead and lifted Ka-poel, pushing her along before the next wave.\nAs quickly as he’d entered the vicious breakers, he was suddenly out of\nthem again, climbing up on a stone shelf and turning to help the rest of the\nlancers as they emerged one by one, soaked and freezing, from the pitlike\nswell. Half of them had lost their carbines. A few had even lost their belts\nand swords. Little Gamble’s arm was broken, and Jackal helped him to\nsafety and set the bone.\nStyke climbed along the ledge until he reached the sea gate. It was a\nheavy, iron-bar door like one might find in a dungeon. It was secured by\nchains thick enough to deter anyone lacking a smith’s hammer.\n“Belts!” Ibana ordered.\nThey tied the soaking belts together, then wrapped them around the iron\nbars closest to the rusted, salt-wrecked hinges. Styke stood at the front,\nflexed his forearms, and set his feet, passing the belt along the group.\n“Heave!” Ibana shouted.\nThe hinges cracked.\n“Heave!”\nThe door shuddered and pulled away from the stone, clattering off the\nledge and down into the sea, nearly taking Styke with it before he pulled his\nknife and cut the belt beneath his hands. The knotted belts were untied and\npassed back, and the group quickly filed inside.\nThe corridor was dark and wet, cut out of the very rock upon which the\ncitadel rested. Someone pressed a torch into Styke’s hands. He removed the\nwax cloth from the end, and Ibana struck the match and lit it. Several more\ntorches were passed along, and soon the corridor was illuminated in a\nflickering light. Styke pressed his palm to the stone, feeling the shudder\ncaused by the firing of the guns. Somewhere above him, he heard a distant\nscream. He began to run.\nThe corridor was not long, and they soon emerged into a wider room—a\npit at the bottom of a long, circular staircase, the base of which was littered\nwith empty barrels, frayed ropes, shattered masonry, and corpses.\nThe corpses were not old, and the smell of them reached Styke’s nostrils\nas he lowered his torch to let the light play upon their faces. They were two\ndays dead, maybe less, and they wore the yellow jackets and pinned lapels\nof high-ranking Fatrastan officers. Styke only paused for a moment, a curse\nupon his lips. These were the missing brigadiers of the Third Army. They\nhad died with knives to the backs and slit throats, and Dvory was not among\nthem.\n“Up!” Styke urged.\nThe circular staircase ended in a flat, stone ceiling, with the steps\ndisappearing into a wooden trapdoor. Styke reached it first, pushing on the\ndoor. First tentatively, then harder, he pressed against it with his palms,\nattempting to lift it above him.\nIbana squeezed up beside him on the staircase and pushed. The door\nrattled some, but did not give. “It’s barred,” she told him.\n“Willen could have damned well mentioned this,” Styke growled. He"

He\nshoved himself between the door and the top few steps, bending his neck\nand placing his shoulders against the wood. Taking a deep breath, he\nattempted to stand, shoving upward like a man lifting a sack of grain on his\nback.\nThe door held. He heard a creak, then a groan, and he continued to push\nuntil he could bear it no longer. He relaxed, taking a deep breath.\n“We’re going to have to go back out and scale the damned wall,” Ibana\nsaid. “Lindet’s going to have to damn well wait.”\n“Look for something down there to use as a battering ram.”\n“The angle isn’t going to work for a ram,” Ibana snorted. “This was\nmade to withstand a siege. You’re not going to break it.”\nStyke reset his shoulders and braced his hands and knees. He took a\ndeep breath and pushed upward again. He strained, grunted, shoving until\nevery muscle trembled beneath the strain.\n“Ben, you’re going to damn well hurt yourself.”\nStyke heard another scream far above him—a scream of pain, no doubt\nfrom a soldier wounded by a sharpshooter. In his mind’s eye, though, it\nbelonged to Lindet. He thought of all the years he’d spent in the labor\ncamps, and he discarded them for the memory of a little girl tucking candies\nbeneath his tongue when he was helpless, and he continued to push.\nHe felt something pop, a terrible pain spreading across his chest. He\nshoved harder, tears running down his face.\n“Ben!” Ibana warned, but the voice seemed far away.\nSomething touched his bare skin. It was a hand, small and delicate,\nsnaking beneath his shirt and tracing a trail with its fingernails up his spine\nuntil it was just below where his shoulders met the wood of the trapdoor.\nThrough his foggy vision, he saw Ka-poel’s face just beneath his left arm,\nher eyes once again young and mischievous. “What …?” he gasped.\nThe fingers tensed, nails biting into his skin. He felt a surge of strength,\nthe smell of coppery sorcery filling his nostrils. His muscles bent and\nflexed, bones threatening to snap from the strain, and then a sudden crack\nand the release of tension as he surged upward. His momentum took him up\nand through the trapdoor, where he took several steps and collapsed on the\ncool stone floor of what appeared to be a large pantry full of beer kegs and\nsacks of grain.\nHe lay there, hand on his chest, as the Mad Lancers swarmed up the\nstairs to fill the pantry. His head pounded, his muscles on fire, and he heard\nIbana distantly as she snapped orders. “Jackal, take these eight and open the\nfront gates. If you survive that, head up and clear the towers. You four, see\nwhat you can do about the docks. The rest of you are with me and Ben.”\nStyke rolled over onto his back and gasped. Ka-poel crouched above\nhim, her head tilted quizzically.\n“That really hurt,” he told her between breaths."

The pain was suddenly gone, the fire diminished. She\ntapped his ribs again and made two fists in front of his eyes, then pulled\nthem apart.\n“I broke a rib?”\nShe nodded.\nHe prodded the area gingerly, but felt no pain. “Did you heal it?”\nShe shook her head.\nStyke climbed to his feet, expecting the lances of pain at any moment,\nbut they never came. “What did you do? Block the pain?”\nKa-poel pursed her lips and wiggled one hand back and forth. More or\nless.\n“This is going to a hurt later, isn’t it?”\nShe grinned wickedly.\n“Pit.” Styke stumbled to Ibana’s side. “Where are we going?”\n“Up, I assume,” she answered, looking him up and down. “Pit, Ben. You\njust snapped an eight-inch beam of ironwood.”\n“A few other things, too. Come on, we have to find Lindet. Then I’m\ngoing to kill whoever is in command here.”\n“With ten men? I sent everyone else to try and open the gate. If Lindet is\nstill alive, she’ll be with Dvory. And he’ll have his whole bodyguard with\nhim. We need an army, Ben.”\nStyke unwrapped the wax cloth protecting his carbine from the water,\nthen hefted his knife. He could still feel that pain deep in his chest, but it\nwas a light buzz beneath Ka-poel’s sorcery. His brain was on fire, his blood\npumping. He felt like he was in his prime again, light on his toes and ready\nto grind stone with his hands. “We don’t need an army. We’re the Mad\nLancers.”\nStyke caught a bayonet thrust on his carbine, turning the blade so that it\nscraped across the stone of the stairwell, and reached over to drive his boz\nknife through the eye of the Dynize soldier attempting to hold the hall. He\nlifted the spasming body and thrust it up the stairs ahead of him, using it as\na shield as musket blasts made his ears ring. He reached the top of the\nstairwell and jerked his knife out of the soldier’s skull, whipping it around\nto cut the throat of another as he passed and emerged into the great hall of\nthe citadel keep.\nSoldiers filled the great hall, turning bayoneted rifles and muskets on\nStyke as he entered the room. There were forty or fifty of them, a mix of\nDynize with their morion helms and breastplates, and Fatrastan turncoats in\ntheir yellow jackets. Styke spotted Dvory at the far end of the great hall,\nand their eyes locked for a split second.\nDvory’s face turned white.\n“You didn’t bring enough men,” Styke shouted over the blasts of musket\nfire.

He ignored it, flipping his\ncarbine over his shoulder and surging forward with his knife, carving into\nthe Dynize.\nHis lancers flooded out of the stairwell behind him. They were down to\neight now, after having to fight out of the kitchens and through the halls.\nMost of them bled from multiple wounds, clothes and faces soaked in\nblood, but the enemy fell back before them as if staring into the teeth of a\nthousand riflemen.\nStyke sidestepped a bayonet thrust, feeling the sharp rasp of the blade\nacross his ribs, and jerked the owner by the lapel onto his knife. He threw\nthe body to one side and slashed, blinding a Fatrastan turncoat and leaving\nhim to fall beneath Ibana’s sword.\nTo one side, Ka-poel slid through the fighting like a snake in a den of\nrats. She stepped around bayonets and between gunshots, her machete in\none hand and a long needle in the other. She thrust and sliced, and the men\nshe killed didn’t even seem to notice her until their blood splashed her black\ngreatcoat.\n“Dvory! Where is your army now, Dvory?” Styke’s knife hand was slick\nwith gore. He disemboweled a Fatrastan, then slid his knife beneath the\nbreastplate of a Dynize and left the woman gurgling in her own blood. A\npistol went off just over his right shoulder, and he felt the bullet take off his\nearlobe. He turned, skipping toward the owner of the pistol and cutting his\nthroat, before returning to his march toward the traitor.\nDvory stood proud in his spot at the end of the great hall. His fingers\ngripped his sword with white-knuckled intensity, and he stared at Styke like\na man staring down a charging boar. Styke wondered briefly if this was a\ntrap—if Dvory had enough guts to fight him—before remembering that\nbefore all this the bastard had been a Mad Lancer. He had the guts.\nSuddenly Styke was through the press of bodies, stumbling into the\nopen. He took a deep breath, a growl in his throat, and felt the pain of a\nthousand tiny wounds. His jacket was soaked with blood and cut to ribbons,\nand rivulets of blood streamed down his neck. He licked his lips, relishing\nthe pain, breathing in the stench of death, powder smoke, and sweat. He\nignored the carnage of the battle still raging around him and took a step\ntoward Dvory—only they existed now, and only one of them would leave\nthis room alive.\nDvory shook his head. “You’re a wreck, Ben. I’ve never seen you\nbloodier.”\nStyke hesitated. Dvory was too composed. He gripped his sword, his\nface was ashen, but he stared at Styke as if he expected to leave here alive.\n“You think I should change sides?” Styke asked.\n“I think you should,” Dvory answered.

His sword remained in its sheath\nas Styke stepped closer and closer. “It’s worked out for me so far.” Dvory’s\npallor deepened, and a sheen of sweat appeared on his brow.\nStyke glanced behind him. Only a few of his lancers remained standing.\nKa-poel crouched over a wounded Dynize, fingers working the air before\nthe man suddenly leapt to his feet with jerky motions and attacked his\ncompanions. Styke took another sidelong step, uncertain. Something was\nwrong here. “How has it worked out?” he asked.\nDvory attempted a smile. Styke could see now that his lips trembled.\nThey moved, slowly, and Styke thought he heard a whisper. His hair stood\non end as he realized that the coppery smell in the room was not all Ka-\npoel’s sorcery. It belonged to someone else, another bone-eye.\n“Where’s Lindet?” Styke demanded.\n“Here,” a voice responded.\nStyke skipped to the side, turning the blade of his knife just in time to\ncatch the thrust from a short, powerful man wearing black leathery armor.\nAs he deflected the thrust, he snatched the carbine from his shoulder and\nsmashed it across the side of the man’s face, snapping the butt just below\nthe trigger. The man staggered to one side, shook his head, and righted\nhimself.\nA dragonman. And not just any, Styke realized as three more figures\nemerged from a hidden door to Dvory’s right. The dragonmen he’d faced\noutside Granalia. Ji-Orz held Lindet by the back of the neck easily, his hand\ncocked as if ready to snap her spine with a flexed muscle. Lindet herself\nwore the same jacket and skirt that he’d spotted her in disembarking her\nship. There were bruises on her face, but she looked no worse for wear. She\nlifted her chin toward Styke, as if unconcerned by the dragonmen around\nher.\nThe dragonman who’d attempted to blindside Styke took a step back,\nreassessing him, and licked his lips.\n“Drop the knife or she dies,” Dvory said, gesturing to Lindet.\nStyke eyed Dvory for a moment, watching him tremble and sweat and\ntasting that smell of sorcery. “Are you really a traitor?” he asked Dvory. “Or\ndid a bone-eye get his fingers in you?”\nDvory’s tremble turned into an outright shake. “I told you to drop the\nknife.” The voice that emerged did not belong to Dvory. It belonged to\nsomeone elderly, the accent biting and educated. Styke realized that Dvory’s\neyes were no longer on him, but directed over Styke’s shoulder. He didn’t\nhave to look to know what had transfixed Dvory’s attention.\n“A bone-eye it is, then,” Styke said. “Is it that piece of shit Ka-Sedial?”\nHe gestured with his knife toward the dragonmen. “The one who sent\nthese?”\n“Ben, I didn’t—” The voice belonged to Dvory for a split second before\na look of annoyance crossed Dvory’s face and the voice changed back to"

Drop the knife or I kill Lindet. You won’t let her die, will you?\nThat’s why you fought your way through all of these. For her.” There was a\nflicker of a smile on Dvory’s face. “Blood sees blood, Styke. Drop the\nknife, or I kill your sister.”\n“Your what?” Ibana demanded, stepping up beside Styke, her eyes wide.\nStyke locked eyes with Lindet. He saw the corner of her mouth twitch\nupward and couldn’t help but smile. A chuckle escaped his lips, and within\nmoments he was laughing outright. He dropped his broken carbine and\nslapped his knee, then threw his head back in a roar. Across from him, her\nneck still in the grip of Ji-Orz, Lindet laughed with him.\nDvory stared at him in puzzlement. “What is so funny?”\nKa-poel stepped up to Styke’s right. A dozen walking cadavers, their\neyes blank, their bodies bloody, swayed behind her. She stared at Dvory,\nfingering her machete, and Dvory stared back. Ka-Sedial, it seemed, could\nbe distracted.\n“He’s laughing,” Lindet said softly, forcing Dvory to turn toward her,\n“because you have no idea who we are. Ben will save me if he can, just as I\nwould him. But death? We’ve stared at our own deaths since childhood. You\nthink to cow us with fear?” Lindet gave a warm, almost happy chuckle. “If\nyou kill me, I am dead. I doubt Ben will mourn me long. I don’t deserve it.\nBut I am his blood, and he will avenge me.” She paused, looking up into the\neyes of Ji-Orz. “We laugh because whatever happens to me, the rest of you\nare already dead. Ben, kill them all.”\nSeveral things happened at once. The closest dragonman took a step\ntoward Styke, knife thrusting, while a second dragonman broke for Ka-poel.\nA third jumped for Ibana.\nStyke caught his opponent’s thrust with his boz knife. The dragonman\nwas ready for the counter and stepped close, drawing a second knife in the\nblink of an eye and ramming it, underhand, at Styke’s side. Stepping into\nthe blade, Styke felt it bite into his buttock, and the tip hit his pelvis. He\nwrapped his off arm around the dragonman’s neck, pulling him against his\nbreast, and squeezed with all his might. The dragonman jerked once,\ndropping his knife and slapping weakly at Styke’s shoulder before\nslumping.\nStyke cast the body aside as the third dragonman closed with Ibana. She\nfired her pistol point-blank, barely slowing her attacker, and drew her knife.\nIbana was strong, but she was not as fast, and she fell back beneath three\nquick thrusts that threatened to overwhelm her.

Styke swallowed the pain\nburning in his leg and leapt, tackling her assailant from the side just as he\nburied his knife between Ibana’s ribs.\nThe dragonman squirmed beneath Styke, reached for another knife, and\nStyke bit off his nose and spat it in his face. He rolled off the dragonman\nand came up with his own knife just a fraction of a second quicker, burying\nit into the soft flesh just above the dragonman’s armor and sternum.\nStyke turned to find that the second dragonman had cut through Ka-\npoel’s ensorcelled soldiers with ease, and now pressed her violently. Styke\nforced himself to his feet, barely able to move, and took a step toward her.\n“Don’t kill her!” Dvory yelled in Ka-Sedial’s voice.\nThe dragonman attacking Ka-poel faltered for a split second, trapping\nKa-poel’s machete with his own knife and turning his head just a fraction\ntoward Dvory, as if in question. Ka-poel’s other hand darted up, striking as\nquick as an adder, and rammed a long needle into the dragonman’s eye.\nStyke took a second step as the dragonman fell, and then stumbled down\nto one knee. He looked at Dvory, at the expression of horror on his face,\nthen toward Lindet, who smiled softly in the grip of Ji-Orz.\n“Kill her,” Dvory ordered. “Kill Lindet, kill Styke, and bring me the\ngirl.”\nStyke looked around the room. Everyone was dead or dying. Ibana\nclutched at the knife stuck between her ribs, struggling to breathe. Lindet\nwas fodder for the dragonman. Ka-poel was quick, but she would not be\nable to handle Ji-Orz on her own. And Dvory still stood unwounded,\nunfluttered, his body being controlled by someone a continent away.\n“Kill her,” Dvory hissed.\nJi-Orz pursed his lips. There was no fear in his eyes as he looked across\nthe carnage, but there was something else. His eyes met Styke’s, and he\ngave a long-suffering sigh and let go of Lindet’s neck. “No.”\n“What?” Dvory demanded.\n“Your hold on me has broken. You are weak, Great Ka. You are spread\ntoo thin, and I am no longer compelled.” Ji-Orz drew the bone knife from\nhis belt, then a bone knife from beneath his jacket, and lay them both on the\nground. “I’m tired,” he said. “I’m tired of this. I’m tired of you. I’ve\nwatched Ben Styke kill three dragonmen. In all my life, I have never and\nwill never see such a thing again. I may fight him someday, but I refuse to\nslaughter an artist like this when he is barely able to fight.”\nDvory straightened, his trembling intensifying. “You’re scared of him?”\n“I am a dragonman. We do not feel fear.” Ji-Orz looked sidelong at\nLindet. “But I respect strength.”"

He could see the fight in Dvory’s\neyes and the sweat on his brow. He squeezed his eyes shut, then wiped the\nperspiration from his cheeks with the back of his sleeve. He gave a mighty\nshiver before looking down at Styke with someone else’s eyes.\n“You’ll bleed out soon enough, Styke. No one survives those wounds.”\nStyke still rested on one knee, his head feeling heavy and his eyes tired.\nThe dragonman’s exit seemed to take the strength from his limbs, and he\nwanted nothing more than to lie down and sleep. He touched the bloody\nstone with one hand and tried to gather his wits before shakily pushing\nhimself back up to his feet. He lifted his knife.\nDvory swallowed, looking from Styke to Ka-poel. His face took on an\nalmost paternalistic expression. “Child,” he said. “I’ve been calling for you.\nWhy don’t you answer? Kill them for me, and then join me in Landfall.\nYou’ve locked the godstone, but I will unravel it sooner or later. With your\nhelp I can end this war quickly. We can put a stop to this bloodshed and\nunite the continents once more.”\nKa-poel gestured emphatically.\n“I don’t know what that means. Why do you not speak? Are you mute?”\nStyke lurched forward, grabbing Dvory by the arm as he began to draw\nhis sword. He pressed the tip of his knife to Dvory’s throat. “She called you\na prick.”\nDvory’s lips drew back in a snarl, and suddenly Styke felt himself\npushed aside. He staggered away as Ka-poel took his place in front of\nDvory. She leaned toward him, searching his eyes as if looking through a\nlooking glass at something far away.\n“My child,” Dvory whispered.\nKa-poel lifted her long needle and gently drew the tip down Dvory’s\ncheek, gathering drops of blood as it went. She held it up to the light, and\nDvory shifted nervously in front of her. She smiled at the man she saw\nbehind Dvory’s countenance, and thrust her needle into Dvory’s eye.\nThe scream that issued from Dvory was not in his own voice.\nStyke staggered toward Ibana, only for Lindet to rush forward, putting\nher shoulder beneath his arm and helping him the rest of the way.

Will you?”\n“I …” Ibana tried to shift, her face going white. “I don’t think it hit\nanything vital. But it hurts like pit. We need a surgeon.”\nLindet paused in her making of bandages. “Get me to the signal towers\nand I’ll tell my ships that the citadel is ours. You’ll be healed by sorcery by\nthe morning. If you last that long.”\nIbana stared at the side of Lindet’s face. “I didn’t see it before, but now I\ndon’t know why I didn’t. Your sister.” She snorted. “You have a damned lot\nof explaining to do, Benjamin.”\nStyke locked eyes with Lindet. He saw, for just a fraction of a second,\nLindet’s desire to make sure no one left this room alive but the two of them.\nHe shook his head. She hesitated, then nodded. “Bandage yourselves. I’ll\nsend the signals.”\nDvory’s screams, in the voice of another, lasted for the rest of the night.\nCHAPTER 69\nV\nlora wiped the gore from her sword, teetering on the edge of\nconsciousness before a quick hit of powder brought her back from the edge.\nShe leapt forward, sword in one hand and knife in the other, carving\nthrough a platoon of Dynize soldiers who attempted to hold her at the end\nof their bayonets. Sorcerous speed allowed her to slip through the gap\nbetween their blades, her sword flicking precisely. Her body moved\nmechanically, without the wherewithal for conscious thought, and she\ncouldn’t have said whether it was seconds or hours between the time she’d\nturned on that platoon and the time the last man hit the dirt.\nProbably seconds. She knew it had been hours since the fight had begun,\nin the same way a man half-asleep knows when someone is trying to wake\nhim up. Thousands lay dead behind her, littering the road back toward the\nCrease. Thousands more screamed from their wounds. She forced herself to\nignore the savagery of it and press on, looking for the next throat to open\nwith the tip of her sword.\nThe little part of her mind still able to function wondered where Taniel\nhad gotten to. Most of the carnage along the road belonged to him—he was\nan impossible force, cutting a swath through the Dynize column with the\nsame unstoppable power as a cannonball skipping across a battlefield. They\nwere both up in the foothills now, killing their way through a second\nbrigade of soldiers, and she’d lost sight of him at some point in what she\nthought was just the last few minutes.\nSomeone in the distance yelled to open fire, and bullets whizzed over\nVlora’s head or struck the dirt around her.

She barely noticed it through her powder trance, but she reached\nout toward the sound of firing muskets and detonated the powder she felt in\nthat direction.\nA chorus of screams and a cloud of smoke rose from the ridgetop to her\nleft, and the kickback from detonating all that powder literally knocked her\noff her feet. Her vision grew dark for a few moments and she wrestled with\nher mind to keep herself from losing consciousness.\nWithout even giving her body clear orders, she was back on her feet and\nsprinting toward a group of horsemen as they charged foolishly toward her\ndown the road, horses leaping the bodies that Taniel had left in his wake.\nShe reached out to detonate their powder, found none, and instead gathered\nall her sorcerous strength to leap into their midst with sword swinging. One\nthrust, midleap, cut the jugular of a dragoon. As she came down, she\nrammed her knife into the thigh of another dragoon, then landed in a\ncrouch, sword swinging up to remove the leg of a horse that slammed into\nthe ground behind her, rolling and crushing its rider.\nVlora barked a laugh and heard it tinged with mania. Nothing these\nassholes could throw at her could take her down. Not a thousand men, not\nten thousand. She was soaked in the blood of their companions, coated in\npowder grime and dirt, her shirt half torn away and her hair a knotted mess\nof gore. She changed directions, pivoting on one foot to deal with the\ndragoons who had just ridden past her, and took a step forward.\nAt least, she tried to take one step forward. The leg worked, but her foot\nturned beneath her with a stab of pain that cut through the powder trance to\nhit her right between the eyes. She grunted, gave a half-hearted scream, and\nthen felt the slashing point of a dragoon’s blade cut savagely across her\nsword arm. Her fingers numb, the sword flew from her hand, and Vlora\ndropped to her knees.\nIt took her a few moments to assess the situation. During her jump, one\nof the dragoons must have sliced the tendons of her left foot. She could feel\nthe nerves screaming out in pain through the dull ache of her powder trance.\nThat other dragoon had done the same to her right wrist.\nShe laughed again and flipped her knife around in her left hand,\nattempting to force herself to her one good foot to take the dragoons’ final\ncharge.\nPerhaps a dozen dragoons had made it past her. They turned their horses,\nswords held at the ready, and watched with uncertainty as she struggled\nback to her feet. All around her, wounded and terrified soldiers seemed to\nstare at her in the same way they might stare at a grenade whose fuse might\nor might not have failed.\nVlora detonated the powder of a squad of soldiers approaching from\nbehind her. The act knocked her back to the ground and tore a gasp from her\nthroat. One of the Dynize dragoons dismounted and took a half step toward\nher. His companions did the same. None of them had any powder on them,\nwhich meant that they’d been sent specifically to stop her. Perhaps even to"

Vlora reached out, gingerly feeling for every ounce of powder\non the infantry within a half mile.\nThe sorcerous backlash of such a detonation would kill her. But it would\nkeep her from being taken alive. Mentally, she held a match above that\npowder and prepared to set it off as her last living act.\n“By the Mighty,” one of the dragoons said. “I’ve never seen anything\nlike it.”\nOne of her companions shook his head. “The other one is worse. The\ngeneral sent all of our dragonmen to stop him, and he cut through them like\nthey were lambs.”\n“She tires,” the first dragoon said, thrusting a sword toward Vlora. “The\nother one will, too.”\nThe dragoons approached slowly, swords held at the ready. She could\nsee the fear in their eyes—fear tempered by the smell of victory. She waited\nuntil one of them had come just outside of sword range and sprang from her\nknees, knife slashing. The dragoon was able to lunge back out of the way\nand Vlora stumbled on her useless foot and slipped in the gore of an\ninfantryman, landing face-first on the hard-packed dirt road. She heard\nsomeone laugh.\n“She’s done,” a dragoon said.\n“Do you hear something?” another asked.\n“Only screams. Should we try to take her alive?”\nSomeone kicked the knife out of Vlora’s hand. She was grasped by the\nhair, her head jerked backward. She tried to stab the arm with her knife,\nthen remembered it was no longer in her fingers. The feeble thrust of her\nempty hand was battered away. A foot planted itself in her gut, flipping her\nonto her back.\nThe pain meant very little through her powder trance. She wanted to\nlaugh at them, that mental match still poised above all that powder nearby,\nbut she couldn’t quite summon the energy. I’m dying, she realized. She\nmanaged to get to her knees, the single action taking an eternity. Hands in\nher lap, she stared up at the dragoon who gazed down at her over the point\nof a sword.\nShe wished she could have spent one last night with Olem before she\ndied. She wished that she could tell him once more that she loved him.\n“She’s gone,” the dragoon said, tapping the side of Vlora’s face with his\nsword. “Look at her eyes. We can take her back to the general, but I doubt\nshe’ll survive the trip.”\n“I’m not so sure. Look at her. She’s cut to ribbons, but she’s still\nfighting.”\nVlora wanted to scoff. Other than her hand and foot, she’d barely been\nscratched. She let her head roll around, looking down at her body, before\nrealizing that it was far from the truth. She’d been shot at least four times.\nHer shirt didn’t even exist anymore, and her chest and thighs were a\npatchwork of bloody cuts that she hadn’t even noticed in her bloodlust.\n“Just take her head,” someone said. “No need for the body.”\nThe dragoon pointed his sword between Vlora’s eyes, then raised it to"

She blinked, surprised, then let out a resigned\nsigh. Her sorcerous well had run completely dry. There was nothing left to\ngive. No final detonation, no blaze of glory. She licked the blood off her\nlips and tried to smile at her executioner.\nThe dragoon frowned. Blood began to run down his face, and it took\nVlora several seconds to realize that a perfectly formed icicle had sprouted\nfrom his forehead. Odd, that. There’s no ice in Fatrasta in the summer.\nIcicles rained down, slicing through the remaining dragoons before any of\nthem could raise their swords.\nAm I already dead? she wondered. Is this the final fantasy that my body\ntells me before I give up the ghost?\nSomething strange crept across the ground. At first, she thought it was a\nwave washing over the road. It certainly looked like a wave, but no water\nhad ever been that shade of blue. A woman strode past her, hair tight in\nbraids over both shoulders, wearing an immaculate crimson dress in the\nAdran style. She was wreathed in the same blue that washed over the\nground, and Vlora realized that they were flames. They washed over and\npast that woman with a heat that hurt Vlora’s face and barely even sizzled\nwhen it touched off the powder of dead infantrymen.\nDynize soldiers tried to run, but were consumed in moments, their\nbodies turned to ash where they stood. Vlora fixed her gaze on the woman,\nwondering who she was, though a part of her brain told her that she knew\nthat figure well. Her eyes fell to the woman’s hands, and the blue flame that\nsparked from them without gloves.\n“You don’t look so well, sister,” a voice said.\nVlora tried to turn her head and found that she could not. Someone\nstepped around her, into her field of vision, and leaned close. Gloved hands\ntouched her face gently, and the countenance of a man in his early thirties\nwith auburn hair and curly sideburns smiled at her grimly.\n“Borbador,” Vlora whispered. “Are you dead, too?”\n“Not last I checked.”\n“You must be. Otherwise you wouldn’t be here to meet me on the other\nside.”\nBorbador gently slapped Vlora’s cheek. “Stay with me here, my darling\nsister. You’re not on the other side yet and I’d really rather you not head\nthere when I’ve just arrived.”\n“You can’t be here,” Vlora protested. “I only sent for you a month ago.”\n“You think you’re the only one who can write a letter? Taniel told me\nover a year ago that the Dynize intended to invade. I’ve been raising an\narmy. Look, I can tell you about it later. I just need you to stay awake until\nNila finishes mopping up a few brigades. It’s going to take the two of us to\nkeep you alive.”"

She trembled and wept, wishing any of this was real, knowing\nthat it was the wishful hopes of a dying mind. “I missed you, Bo. I wish I\ncould really say good-bye to you.”\n“Shush now,” Borbador said, pulling Vlora’s head against his chest.\n“Your family has come for you.”\nEPILOGUE\nS\ntyke stood at the top of one of the remaining towers of the Starlight\ncitadel, leaning on the stone battlements as he slowly carved a horse from a\nbit of pine. His left hand still had a twinge from the firing squad despite two\nrounds of sorcerous healing over the last few months, and the pine slipped\nin his hand a few times as he worked. He sucked away the blood each time,\nenjoying the biting feel of the tiny cuts.\n“I’m getting too big for wooden horses,” Celine told him, dangling her\nfeet off the edge of the tower.\n“Who said I’m making it for you?”\n“You always make them for me.”\nStyke held the horse up to the light, then shaved a bit more wood off\neach of the back legs. “You’re an ungrateful little brat, you know that?”\nCeline swung her legs around and crossed the tower to kiss him on the\ncheek, before returning to her spot. “You’re getting better with the knife.”\n“Sorcerous healing will do that.”\n“I thought you said practice makes you better?”\n“I used to be quite good at carving things,” Styke answered, blowing\nwood shavings off the back of his hand. “I had to relearn how to do it with a\ncrippled hand and a dull knife. Come to think of it, having something sharp\non hand makes things a lot easier, too.” He took the horse and walked over\nto Celine, holding it in two fingers and riding it across her shoulder, then\nholding it in front of her eyes. “What breed is he?”\n“He is a she,” Celine said pointedly. “And she’s a Gurlish draft horse.”\nStyke frowned at the carving. “I was aiming for a Starlish draft, but it\ndoes look more like a Gurlish, doesn’t it?” He set the carving next to her.\n“How is Margo?”\n“We’re getting used to each other.”\n“That wasn’t an answer.”\n“Good. I like her a lot. She still starts when she hears a gunshot.”\n“She’s a good horse. We’ll train that out of her.”\nStyke paused, hearing the soft sound of footsteps on the stairs behind\nhim, and half turned to watch Lindet emerge on the parapet. She stood\nstraight-backed and formal by the stairs, her face once again unreadably\nhaughty. She raised her chin at Styke, then let her eyes wander to Celine.\nThere was a question there. He ignored it.\nCeline climbed down from the battlements and stared up at Lindet.\n“You’re the Lady Chancellor?”\n“I am.”"

Yet it seems Ben Styke has taken an\ninterest in you.”\nCeline sniffed, unimpressed. “My da died in the labor camps. Ben\nprotects me. He said he’s made a habit of protecting little girls until they are\nbig enough to protect themselves.”\nLindet’s eye twitched, and Styke rolled his tongue around his teeth in an\neffort to suppress a smile. “It seems our secret is out,” Lindet said. “It’s the\ntalk of the entire Third Army. You know how I feel about tongues\nwagging.”\n“You can’t control everything,” Styke said.\n“I can try.”\n“You can try. But you’ll fail.”\nLindet sighed, then crossed the tower to stand next to him, looking to the\neast, along the northern coast of the Hammer. “You’re not worried about\nyour reputation? Mad Ben Styke, brother to the ruler of Fatrasta? You’re no\nlonger a loose cannon, a force of nature. They’ll know that you came from\nsomeplace. That your sister is the most powerful woman on the continent.\nFamily connections tend to … dim the perception that others have of your\naccomplishments.”\n“I’ve never really given a shit what anyone thought about me,” Styke\nreplied, twirling his lancers’ ring on his finger. “You’re not worried about\nyour reputation?”\n“I sent my own brother to the labor camps for a decade.” Lindet\nshrugged. “I think that goes rather well with my reputation.” He saw the\nflicker of a smile at the corner of her mouth and rolled his eyes.\n“I should throw you off this tower.”\nLindet lifted her hand, placing it on Styke’s arm. “I know. Your healing,\ndid it go well?”\n“It did, thanks.” Styke instinctively rolled his shoulders, feeling the\ntightness from the healed cuts on his torso and the bullet wound in his\nshoulder. “Have you found the Dynize Army?”\n“I have. They pulled back once your men threw open the doors of the\ncitadel. It seems they didn’t want to attack a field army and a fortress at the\nsame time, and during a storm no less.”\n“Your ships?”\n“I lost two to the storm. Three to the citadel guns. The fleet is in\nsurprisingly good shape, considering the circumstances.” She paused, her\neyes narrowing as if something had pained her. “I … I would have lost the\nwar if you had not come in after me. The Third would have been crushed,\nmy fleet scattered, and my person either captured or executed. Thank you\nfor that.”\nStyke remained silent. He couldn’t remember the last time Lindet had\nthanked him for something. Not since childhood, certainly.\nLindet continued. “I have two gifts for you. The first is command of this\ncitadel.

I’ll leave a garrison large enough to\nman the walls, and your lancers. I think this is a good spot for you … for\nnow. I’m going with the Third first thing in the morning, and we’re going to\nsweep the Dynize off the Hammer.

Not a lot of\nplaces he could go, sitting out here on the end of the Hammer. “What’s the\nsecond gift?”\n“The second gift is stored in a vault about seven miles southeast of here.\nYou probably rode past it during your recent adventures.”\nStyke perked up, his heart quickening. “What is it?”\nA self-satisfied smile cracked Lindet’s face. “Your armor. All of it. Three\nhundred sets, plus another two hundred that I’ve gathered since the war.\nThey don’t all match, not like the originals, but I don’t think that will matter\nto you.”\nStyke’s mouth was dry. “I knew you were lying about destroying them.”\n“I knew you knew I was lying.” Lindet gave a shrug, as if it didn’t\nmatter. “Tell me about the Riflejack cavalry among the lancers.”\nIt was Styke’s turn to be coy. “I picked up a few friends along the way.”\n“And your goals in this part of the continent?”\nStyke gave her a thin smile.\nLindet rolled her eyes. “You’re looking for them, aren’t you? The other\ngodstones?” She waited just a moment for an answer, then made a\ndismissive gesture. “The one on the Hammer. I’m guessing you didn’t find\nit?”\n“I did not.”\n“Good. You should keep your distance from the stones, Benjamin. You\nmay be mad, but you don’t want anything to do with them.”\n“And you do?” Styke asked, unable to keep the petulance out of his\nvoice.\n“Hmm. Tell me, where is the bone-eye woman who killed Dvory? What\nwas her name?”\n“I’m not sure what you’re talking about.”\nAll trace of emotion left Lindet’s face. Her jaw tensed. “I’ve had my\nmen looking everywhere for her, yet she seems to have disappeared without\na trace. Your Mad Lancers are pretending she never existed.”\n“Odd, that. It’s as if she never did.”\nLindet snorted. “I’m leaving, Benjamin. You will stay here, and you will\nprotect the coast from the Dynize. When I summon you, I expect you to\nhave your armor and I expect you to have moved past this godstone\nnonsense. The stones will remain unrecovered until this war is won. Do you\nunderstand?” She turned on her heel and left the tower without waiting for\nan answer.\nStyke leaned on the battlements, feeling tired, and watched the ships"

        "text": "understand?” She turned on her heel and left the tower without waiting for\nan answer.\nStyke leaned on the battlements, feeling tired, and watched the ships\nanchored out past the breakers. There were transports, ships of the line,\ncommandeered merchantmen. It was, as he’d suspected, everything that\nLindet had left in this part of the country. Now they crouched in the shadow\nof Starlight’s guns, knowing they were the only protection against the\nroving Dynize fleets.\nLess than a minute had passed before he heard footsteps again. They\nbelonged to Ibana, and she joined him at the battlements immediately and\nglanced out to sea before fixing him with a sidelong stare. “I passed Lindet\non the way up here.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Sister, eh?”\n“Yeah.” Styke didn’t really much feel like talking about it. The\nconversation was going to be a long one, and very uncomfortable.\nTo his surprise, all Ibana said was, “That explains a lot. So what’s our\nplan now?”\n“Lindet has left me in charge of Starlight.”\n“She wants to keep an eye on you.”\n“That she does.”\n“So what will you do?”\n“She also told me where my armor is. There’s a vault seven miles from\nhere. I want you and the lancers to head out immediately and fetch it.”\nThis got Ibana’s attention. A grin slowly spread across her face, and he\ncould see a hungry look in her eye. “We have our armor back.”\n“That we do. We’re going to wait until Lindet’s been gone for three\ndays. Then we’re going to commandeer her fleet and invade Dynize. Sound\ngood?”\nIbana straightened, a fierce grin on her face. “With our armor? That\nsounds wonderful.”\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI have to start with thanks to my fantastic editor, Brit Hvide, and her\nguiding hand throughout the process of writing this book. Sequels are\nalways tricky, and Brit stepped in as editor on the second book in a series\nwithout losing a beat. Thanks to my agent, Caitlin Blasdell, for her\ncontinuing support. She and her colleagues at Liza Dawson Associates help\nmake sure I can keep writing for a living, which is one of the best gifts a\nguy can get!\nThanks to my wife, Michele. She sees every piece of mine before\nanyone else, and her fingerprints are all over the Powder Mage books. I\ncouldn’t dream of writing them without her help.\nMy appreciation goes out to my beta-readers, Mark Lindberg, Joshua\nMulligan, Sam Baskin, Wyatt Nevins, and Peter Keep. Thanks to all the\nawesome staff at Orbit, who continue to help me put out great books. And\nfinally, thanks to all of you for reading and continuing to support me!
