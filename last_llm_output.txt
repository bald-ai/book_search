Query: Glokta asks woman to marry him with ring

REASONING:
The query is about Glokta proposing marriage to a woman with a ring. None of the provided chunks directly mention Glokta proposing marriage or offering a ring to a woman.

Therefore, no chunk matches the query.

Query: Glokta asks woman to marry him with ring

REASONING:
The query is about Glokta proposing marriage to a woman with a ring. 

- **Candidate 1** directly addresses the query. It details Glokta's nervous proposal to Ardee, including the description of the ring and her reaction. This chunk is highly relevant and provides the full context of the scene.
- **Candidate 2** involves Glokta but is about a completely different interaction with Vitari, unrelated to marriage or a ring. It does not match the query.
- **Candidate 3** also involves Glokta and Vitari but focuses on a tense confrontation, not a marriage proposal. It is irrelevant to the query.

Thus, **Candidate 1** is the best match as it is the only chunk that directly describes the marriage proposal scene with the ring.

Final Answer: Candidate 1
